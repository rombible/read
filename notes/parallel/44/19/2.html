We are left to conjecture what prompted the question. The most natural explanation is that St. Paul noticed in them, as they attended the meetings of the Church, a want of spiritual gifts, perhaps, also, a want of the peace and joy and brightness that showed itself in others. They presented the features of a rigorous asceticism like that of the Therapeutae--the outward signs of repentance and mortification--but something was manifestly lacking for their spiritual completeness.<p><span class= "bld">We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</span>--The standpoint of the disciples so exactly corresponds to that of Apollos when he arrived at Ephesus, that we may reasonably think of them as having been converted by his preaching. They must, of course, have known the Holy Spirit as a name meeting them in the Sacred Books, as given to the olden prophets, but they did not think of that Spirit as a living and pervading presence, in which they themselves might claim a share. They had been baptised with the baptism of repentance, and were leading a life of fasting, and prayers, and alms, but they had not passed on to "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost<span class= "ital">"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>). It lies on the surface that they were Jewish, not Gentile, disciples.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- And he said</span> for <span class="accented">he said</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">did ye receive</span> for <span class="accented">have ye received</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">when</span> for <span class="accented">since</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Ghost was given</span> for <span class="accented">we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Did ye receive</span>, etc.? The R.V. gives the sense much more accurately than the A.V., which is, "Did ye receive the Holy Ghost at the time of your baptism, when ye first believed?" Something led the apostle to suspect that they had not received the seal of the Spirit (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), and so he asked the question. The answer, <span class="cmt_word">Nay, we did, not so much as hear whether the Holy Ghost was given</span>, as in the R.V., is justified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>, where the exactly similar phrase, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is rendered in the A.V., "The Holy Spirit was not yet given." "<span class="accented">Esse</span> pro <span class="accented">adesse"</span> (Bengel). The sense given in the A.V. does not seem probable. The answer means, "Not only have we not received the Holy Spirit, but we had not even heard that the dispensation of the Spirit was Come." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-7 Paul, at Ephesus, found some religious persons, who looked to Jesus as the Messiah. They had not been led to expect the miraculous powers of the Holy Ghost, nor were they informed that the gospel was especially the ministration of the Spirit. But they spake as ready to welcome the notice of it. Paul shows them that John never design that those he baptized should rest there, but told them that they should believe on Him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. They thankfully accepted the discovery, and were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. The Holy Ghost came upon them in a surprising, overpowering manner; they spake with tongues, and prophesied, as the apostles and the first Gentile coverts did. Though we do not now expect miraculous powers, yet all who profess to be disciples of Christ, should be called on to examine whether they have received the seal of the Holy Ghost, in his sanctifying influences, to the sincerity of their faith. Many seem not to have heard that there is a Holy Ghost, and many deem all that is spoken concerning his graces and comforts, to be delusion. Of such it may properly be inquired, Unto what, then, were ye baptized? for they evidently know not the meaning of that outward sign on which they place great dependence.</body></html>
