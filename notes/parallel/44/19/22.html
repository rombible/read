Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>, and was chosen probably as the companion of Timotheus because his office would carry weight with it. Sosthenes, who was with St. Paul when he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,">1Corinthians 1:1</a>), had probably been staying some time at Ephesus, and as having been ruler of the synagogue, was naturally coupled by the Apostle with himself, as a mark of respect and confidence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- And having sent</span> for <span class="accented">so he sent</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Timothy</span> for <span class="accented">Timotheus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he</span> for <span class="accented">but he</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">while</span> for <span class="accented">season</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Two of them</span>, etc. Erastus is here mentioned for the first time. If he is the same person who is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm">2 Timothy 4:20</a>, it is probable that he was one of St. Paul's Corinthian converts who had gone with him from Corinth to Jerusalem and Antioch, and had accompanied him through Phrygia and Galatia to Ephesus. Silos, who had been Timothy's companion on the former visit to Macedonia, seems to have left St. Paul, possibly at Jerusalem, from whence he originally came (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22, 32, 34</a>), and to have attached himself to Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). Perhaps he was especially connected with the mission to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, etc., as it appears from the passage just quoted that he was "a faithful brother unto them," A.V.; "or our faithful brother," R.V. <span class="cmt_word">He himself stayed</span>, etc. This phrase is in singular harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8</a>, which seems clearly to have been written after Timothy's departure for Macedonia and before his arrival at Corinth, since Timothy is not mentioned either in the superscription or among the salutations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19, 20</a>), and his coming to Corinth is spoken of as doubtful, though probable, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>. Both passages imply a prolongation of Paul's stay at Ephesus beyond his original intention. The special reason for this prolongation of his sojourn at Ephesus, and which is alluded to in 1 Car 16:9, is thought to be the Artemisian or Ephesian games, which were celebrated at Ephesus in May - and therefore just at this time - and which brought a vast concourse of Ionians to Ephesus. It was at this time, doubtless, that the principal sale of "silver shrines of Diana" took place, and therefore it was natural that Demetrius and his fellow-craftsmen should be very angry when they found their usual gains were cut short by the multitude of converts all over Proconsular Asia. We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a> that Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus had arrived at Ephesus from Corinth. It is likely that their presence, together with that of Tychicus and Trophimus, two Asiatic converts, enabled St. Paul to dispense with the services of Time-thy and Erastus for a time. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, understand <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, kept himself back, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> stayed; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a while, an indefinite phrase, but indicating a short time.

See how craftsmen make advantage to themselves of people's superstition, and serve their worldly ends by it. Men are jealous for that by which they get their wealth; and many set themselves against the gospel of Christ, because it calls men from all unlawful crafts, however much wealth is to be gotten by them. There are persons who will stickle for what is most grossly absurd, unreasonable, and false; as this, that those are gods which are made with hands, if it has but worldly interest on its side. The whole city was full of confusion, the common and natural effect of zeal for false religion. Zeal for the honour of Christ, and love to the brethren, encourage zealous believers to venture into danger. Friends will often be raised up among those who are strangers to true religion, but have observed the honest and consistent behaviour of Christians.</body></html>
