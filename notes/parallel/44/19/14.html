(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-15.htm" title="And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,">Matthew 21:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>.) It is hardly probable, however, that one in that position would have taken to this disreputable calling, and it seems more likely that the title itself was part of the imposture. He called himself a chief priest, and as such St. Luke, or Tyrannus, described him. The scene is brought vividly before us. The seven exorcists, relying partly, we may believe, in the mystical virtue of their number, stand face to face with a demoniac, frenzied and strong like the Gadarene of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/5-3.htm" title="Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:">Mark 5:3-4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - A <span class="accented">chief priest</span> for <span class="accented">and chief of the priests</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">this</span> for <span class="accented">so</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A chief priest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>); not, of course, in the sense of <span class="accented">high priest</span>, but in that wider sense of the word which comprised the chiefs of the twenty-four courses and the members of the Sanhedrim and all who had ever been high priests or who were of the kindred of the high priest (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-15.htm">Matthew 21:15</a>; 23:45, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-23.htm">Acts 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-24.htm">Acts 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-14.htm">Acts 9:14, 21</a>, etc.). It is probable that the Eleazar mentioned in the preceding note was a priest, both from his name and because Josephus calls him one of his <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which may mean "fellow-tribesmen." The name <span class="accented">Sceca</span> occurs nowhere else, nor is its meaning or etymology at all certain. Some identify it with the Latin <span class="accented">Scaera</span> (Horace, 'Ep.,' 1. 17:1), "left-handed," <span class="accented">l</span>.<span class="accented">q. Scaevola</span>; or the Greek <span class="accented">Scenes</span>, a proper name in Appian. Simonis gives it an Aramean etymology. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:13-20 It was common, especially among the Jews, for persons to profess or to try to cast out evil spirits. If we resist the devil by faith in Christ, he will flee from us; but if we think to resist him by the using of Christ's name, or his works, as a spell or charm, Satan will prevail against us. Where there is true sorrow for sin, there will be free confession of sin to God in every prayer and to man whom we have offended, when the case requires it. Surely if the word of God prevailed among us, many lewd, infidel, and wicked books would be burned by their possessors. Will not these Ephesian converts rise up in judgement against professors, who traffic in such works for the sake of gain, or allow themselves to possess them? If we desire to be in earnest in the great work of salvation, every pursuit and enjoyment must be given up which hinders the effect of the gospel upon the mind, or loosens its hold upon the heart.</body></html>
