(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>.) At the time which we have now reached, the office was filled by Ananias, son of Nebedseus, who owed his appointment to Herod Agrippa II., then King of Chalcis, to whom Claudius had conceded the privilege of nominating the high priests (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xx.</span> 5, ? 2). The official acts of his predecessors would of course be known to the high priest for the time being, and St. Paul can therefore appeal to his knowledge as confirming his own statements.<p><span class= "bld">All the estate of the</span> <span class= "bld">elders.</span>--The word is perhaps used as identical with the Sanhedrin, or Council; perhaps, also, as including the <span class= "ital">Gerousia, </span>or "Senate," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-21.htm" title="And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.">Acts 5:21</a>--a body, possibly of the nature of a permanent committee, or an Upper Chamber, which was apparently represented in the Sanhedrin, and yet had separate rights, and might hold separate meetings of its own.<p><span class= "bld">I received letters unto the</span> <span class= "bld">brethren.</span>--The phrase is interesting, as showing that the Jews used this language of each other, and that it passed from them to the Church of Christ. On the general history of St. Paul's conversion, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/9-1.htm" title="And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,">Acts 9:1-16</a>. Here it will be sufficient to note points that are more or less distinctive. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a> the letters are said to have been addressed to the "synagogues."<p><span class= "bld">For to be punished.</span>--We must remember that the punishments would include imprisonment, scourging, and brutal violence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/26-10.htm" title="Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.">Acts 26:10-11</a>); or, as in the case of Stephen, death by stoning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Journeyed</span> for <span class="accented">went</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">them also</span> for <span class="accented">them</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto Jerusalem in beads</span> for <span class="accented">bound unto Jerusalem</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The high priest</span>. Ananias, the present high priest, who may have been one of St. Paul's hearers included among the "fathers," and who had probably been already a member of the Sanhedrim at the time of St. Paul's conversion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-1.htm">Acts 24:1</a>). Others, however, understand "the high priest" to mean him who was high priest at the time of St. Paul's journey to Damascus, viz. Theophilus, who was still alive. <span class="cmt_word">The brethren</span>. The Jews at Damascus.

Paul relates the history of his early life very particularly; he notices that his conversion was wholly the act of God. Condemned sinners are struck blind by the power of darkness, and it is a lasting blindness, like that of the unbelieving Jews. Convinced sinners are struck blind as Paul was, not by darkness, but by light. They are for a time brought to be at a loss within themselves, but it is in order to their being enlightened. A simple relation of the Lord's dealings with us, in bringing us, from opposing, to profess and promote his gospel, when delivered in a right spirit and manner, will sometimes make more impression that laboured speeches, even though it amounts not to the full proof of the truth, such as was shown in the change wrought in the apostle.</body></html>
