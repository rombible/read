In both instances, it will be noted, the order for the punishment came from a Roman officer.<p><span class= "bld">Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman</span> <span class= "bld">. . .?</span>--Stress is laid on both points. It was unlawful to scourge a Roman citizen in any case; it was an aggravation so to torture him, as slaves were tortured, only as a means of inquiry. On the whole question of the rights of Roman citizens, and St. Paul's claim to those rights, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - When <span class="accented">they had tied him up with the thongs</span> for <span class="accented">as they bound him with thongs</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When they had tied him up</span>, etc. This does not seem to be a right rendering. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> can only mean "to stretch out before," or "expose to the action," of anything, when taken in a literal sense; <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, again, more naturally means the "thong" or lash of a whip or scourge than a thong to bind a man with; indeed, it is thought to be etymologically connected with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3be;</span>, Meyer, therefore, rightly understands the passage to mean when they had stretched him on the stake ready to receive the scourging. <span class="cmt_word">Is it lawful</span>, etc.? Paul now pleads his privileges as a Roman citizen, just in time to stop the outrage, remembering, no doubt, the terror inspired in the Philippian magistrates when they found they had beaten with rods an uncondemned Roman citizen (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-38.htm">Acts 16:38</a>). Uncondemned (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">Acts</span> 16:37. Only found in these two passages in the New Testament, and nowhere else. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:22-30 The Jews listened to Paul's account of his conversion, but the mention of his being sent to the Gentiles, was so contrary to all their national prejudices, that they would hear no more. Their frantic conduct astonished the Roman officer, who supposed that Paul must have committed some great crime. Paul pleaded his privilege as a Roman citizen, by which he was exempted from all trials and punishments which might force him to confess himself guilty. The manner of his speaking plainly shows what holy security and serenity of mind he enjoyed. As Paul was a Jew, in low circumstances, the Roman officer questioned how he obtained so valuable a distinction; but the apostle told him he was free born. Let us value that freedom to which all the children of God are born; which no sum of money, however large, can purchase for those who remain unregenerate. This at once put a stop to his trouble. Thus many are kept from evil practices by the fear of man, who would not be held back from them by the fear of God. The apostle asks, simply, Is it lawful? He knew that the God whom he served would support him under all sufferings for his name's sake. But if it were not lawful, the apostle's religion directed him, if possible, to avoid it. He never shrunk from a cross which his Divine Master laid upon his onward road; and he never stept aside out of that road to take one up.</body></html>
