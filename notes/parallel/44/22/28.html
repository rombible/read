Probably the translators used the word in the sense in which we still speak of the "freedom "of a city. The chiliarch was himself, apparently, an alien by birth, and, as was customary at the time, had obtained the citizenship by the payment of a large bribe. As the admission of citizens now rested with the Emperor, as holding the office of Censor, the money had probably been paid to Narcissus, or some other of Claudius' favourite freed-men who carried on a traffic of this kind.<p><span class= "bld">I was free born.</span>--The Greek is somewhat more emphatic: <span class= "ital">I am one even from birth.</span> This implies that St. Paul's father or grandfather had received the citizenship; how, we cannot tell. Many of the Jews who were taken to Rome by Pompeius as slaves first obtained their freedom and became <span class= "ital">libertini, </span>and afterwards were admitted on the register as citizens. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm" title="Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.">Acts 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>.) The mention of kinsmen or friends at Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-11.htm" title="Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.">Romans 16:11</a>), makes it probable, as has been said, that the Apostle's father may have been among them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> <span class="accented">- Citizenship</span> for <span class="accented">freedom</span>, A.V; <span class="accented">am a Roman</span> for <span class="accented">was free</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A great sum</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>).

Dion Cassius (9 17) relates that Messaliua, the wife of the Emperor Claudius, used to sell the freedom of the city, and that at first she sold it (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) for a very high price, but that afterwards it became very cheap. In all probability Lysias had so purchased it, and in consequence took the name of Claudius (Renan, ' St. Paul,' p. 524). <span class="cmt_word">I am a Roman born</span>. It is not known how St. Paul's family acquired the Roman citizenship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:22-30 The Jews listened to Paul's account of his conversion, but the mention of his being sent to the Gentiles, was so contrary to all their national prejudices, that they would hear no more. Their frantic conduct astonished the Roman officer, who supposed that Paul must have committed some great crime. Paul pleaded his privilege as a Roman citizen, by which he was exempted from all trials and punishments which might force him to confess himself guilty. The manner of his speaking plainly shows what holy security and serenity of mind he enjoyed. As Paul was a Jew, in low circumstances, the Roman officer questioned how he obtained so valuable a distinction; but the apostle told him he was free born. Let us value that freedom to which all the children of God are born; which no sum of money, however large, can purchase for those who remain unregenerate. This at once put a stop to his trouble. Thus many are kept from evil practices by the fear of man, who would not be held back from them by the fear of God. The apostle asks, simply, Is it lawful? He knew that the God whom he served would support him under all sufferings for his name's sake. But if it were not lawful, the apostle's religion directed him, if possible, to avoid it. He never shrunk from a cross which his Divine Master laid upon his onward road; and he never stept aside out of that road to take one up.</body></html>
