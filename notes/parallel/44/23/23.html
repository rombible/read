They are coupled by the military writers of the Byzantine empire with archers and <span class= "ital">peltastae, </span>or light shield-bearers. The escort seems a large one for a single prisoner, but the tumults of the previous days, and the information just received as to the conspiracy, gave the chiliarch good reason to apprehend a formidable attack.<p><span class= "bld">At the third hour of the night.</span>--Assuming that St. Luke uses the Jewish reckoning, this would be about 9 or 10 p.m. It was evidently the object of the chiliarch to place the prisoner beyond the reach of an attack before daybreak. With this view, all, as well as the horsemen, were to be mounted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- Of the centurions</span> for <span class="accented">centurions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and said</span> for <span class="accented">saying</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as far as</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Two hundred soldiers</span>; one hundred for each centurion; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, foot-soldiers, who alone would be under the command of the centurions. The <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> would be under the command perhaps of a <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or decurio, captain of a turma, or squadron. Here there would seem to be two turmae because a turma consisted of thirty-three men - here possibly of thirty-five. <span class="cmt_word">Spearmen</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. This word occurs nowhere else in Scripture or in any ancient Greek author. It is first found in" Theophylactus Simocatta, in the seventh century, and then again in the tenth century in Constantine Porphyrogenitus" (Meyer). It seems most probable that it was the name of some particular kind of light infantry. But it is not easy to explain the etymology. Perhaps they were a kind of skirmishers thrown out on a march to protect the flanks of an army; as Plutarch speaks of javelin-men and slingers being placed to guard, not only the rear, but also the flanks of the army on the march (Steph., 'Thesaur.,' under <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). "Holding or taking the right" might be the force of the compound, somewhat after the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.; which agrees with the explanations of Phavorinus <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and with that of Beza, "Qui alicui dextrum latus [meaning simply <span class="accented">latus</span>] munit." Only, instead of the improbable notion of these men being a body-guard of the tribune - which their number makes impossible - it should be understood of the troops which protect the flank of an army on the march. Other improbable explanations are that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means the soldier to whom the right hand of prisoners was fastened, or those who grasp with the right hand their weapon, the lance or javelin. The object of Lysias in sending so large a force was to guard against the possibility of a rescue in the feverish and excited state of the Jewish mind. And no doubt one reason for sending Paul away was his dread of a Jewish riot. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:12-24 False religious principles, adopted by carnal men, urge on to such wickedness, as human nature would hardly be supposed capable of. Yet the Lord readily disappoints the best concerted schemes of iniquity. Paul knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudent means; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, he could not expect God's providence to work on his behalf. He who will not help himself according to his means and power, has neither reason nor revelation to assure him that he shall receive help from God. Believing in the Lord, we and ours shall be kept from every evil work, and kept to his kingdom. Heavenly Father, give us by thy Holy Spirit, for Christ's sake, this precious faith.</body></html>
