Many changes, of course, had come about in that interval, but some of the faces were probably the same; and at all events the general aspect of the G<span class= "ital">azith, </span>or Hall of Meeting, on the south side of the Temple, with its circular benches must have remained the same.<p><span class= "bld">I have lived in all good conscience . . .</span>--The verb for "I have lived" means literally, <span class= "ital">I have used my citizenship.</span> It had ceased, however, to have this sharply defined meaning (see Note on the kindred substantive in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>), and had come to be used of the whole course of a man's social conduct.

The reference to "conscience" may be noted as eminently characteristic of St. Paul. So we find him saying of himself that he had all his life served God with "a pure conscience" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2Timothy 1:3</a>); that a "good conscience" is the end of the commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1Timothy 1:5</a>); or, again, recognising the power of conscience even among the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>). In the phrase "I know nothing by myself," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"I am conscious of no fault" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.">1Corinthians 4:4</a>), we have a like reference to its authority. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-5.htm" title="Why you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.">Romans 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-25.htm" title="Whatever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:">1Corinthians 10:25</a>. And in all these passages he assigns to conscience its true functions with an exact precision. It is not an infallible guide and requires illumination, and therefore each man needs to pray for light, but it is never right to act against its dictates, and that which is objectively the better course is subjectively the worse, unless the man in his heart believes it to be the better.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Looking steadfastly on</span> for <span class="accented">earnestly beholding</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">brethren</span> for <span class="accented">men and brethren</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">I have lived before God</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">I have lived</span>, etc., <span class="accented">before God</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Looking steadfastly</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-4.htm">Acts 3:4, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-15.htm">Acts 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-6.htm">Acts 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-9.htm">Acts 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>.

He emits here the "fathers" which he added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1</a>. If there is any special significance in the omission, it may be that he meant now to assume a less apologetic tone, and to speak as an equal to equals. Howson and Lewin think that he spoke as being, or having been, himself a member of the Sanhedrim. But he may have meant merely a friendly address to his countrymen. <span class="cmt_word">I have lived</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; I have had my conversation (<span class="accented">vitam degi</span>) unto God, or, for God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the will of God, with a view to God as the end of all my actions. So Josephus ('De Maccabeis,' sect. 4) says that Antiochus Epiphanes made a law that all Jews should be put to death <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> "who were seen to live according to the Law of their fathers." And so in 2 Macc. 6:1 it is said that he sent to compel the Jews to forsake the Law of their fathers - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;</span> not live agreeably to the laws of God. And once more, in 3Macc. 3:3, 4 the Jews are said to fear God and to be <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, living according to his Law. Here, then, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> means to live in obedience to God. St. Paul boldly <span class="accented">asserts</span> his undeviating compliance with the Law of God, as a good and consistent Jew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-5 See here the character of an honest man. He sets God before him, and lives as in his sight. He makes conscience of what he says and does, and, according to the best of his knowledge, he keeps from whatever is evil, and cleaves to what is good. He is conscientious in all his words and conduct. Those who thus live before God, may, like Paul, have confidence both toward God and man. Though the answer of Paul contained a just rebuke and prediction, he seems to have been too angry at the treatment he received in uttering them. Great men may be told of their faults, and public complaints may be made in a proper manner; but the law of God requires respect for those in authority.</body></html>
