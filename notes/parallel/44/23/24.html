In the household of Antonia, the mother of the Emperor Claudius, there were two brothers, first slaves, then freed-men, Antonius Felix and Pallas. The latter became the chosen companion and favourite minister of the emperor, and through his influence Felix obtained the procuratorship of Judaea. There, in the terse epigrammatic language of Tacitus, he governed as one who thought, in his reliance on his brother's power, that he could commit any crime with impunity, and wielded "the power of a tyrant in the temper of a slave" (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Ann. </span>xii. 54; <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> v. 9). His career was infamous alike for lust and cruelty. Another historian, Suetonius (<span class= "ital">Claud.</span> c. 28), describes him as the husband of three queens, whom he had married in succession:--(1) Drusilla, the daughter of Juba, King of Mauritania and Selene, the daughter of Autonius and Cleopatra. (2) Drusilla, the daughter of Agrippa I. and sister of Agrippa II. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-24.htm" title="And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe to Felix the governor.">Acts 23:24</a>.) She had left her first husband, Azizus, King of Emesa, to marry Felix (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 7. ? 1). Their son, also an Agrippa, died in an eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 7, ? 2).

Yet the Lord readily disappoints the best concerted schemes of iniquity. Paul knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudent means; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, he could not expect God's providence to work on his behalf. He who will not help himself according to his means and power, has neither reason nor revelation to assure him that he shall receive help from God. Believing in the Lord, we and ours shall be kept from every evil work, and kept to his kingdom. Heavenly Father, give us by thy Holy Spirit, for Christ's sake, this precious faith.</body></html>
