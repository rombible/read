They are, however, wanting in many of the best MSS. and versions, and were apparently added to complete the sentence which St. Luke had left in the emphasis of its unfinished abruptness. Possibly its close was drowned in the tumultuous cries of the Sadducees. The line taken by the Pharisees is altogether that of Gamaliel. After twenty-five years they have not got further than the cautious policy of those who halt between two opinions. They give a verdict of "Not Guilty" as to the specific charges brought against St. Paul. They think it possible that he may have received a vision or revelation of some kind. In the word "spirit" they perhaps admit that the form of Jesus may have appeared to him as a spectre from the world of the dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Clamor</span> for <span class="accented">cry</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">some of the</span> for <span class="accented">the</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of the Pharisees</span> <span class="accented">part</span> for <span class="accented">that were of the, e</span>tc., A.V.; <span class="accented">stood up</span> for <span class="accented">arose</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and what</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel</span> for <span class="accented">a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him</span>, A.V.; the R.T. omits the clause in the T.R., <span class="accented">let us not fight against God. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The scribes</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-39.htm">Luke 20:39</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We find no evil in this man</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-29.htm">John 18:29, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-14.htm">Luke 23:14, 15, 22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What if a spirit</span>, etc.; alluding to what Paul had said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17, 18</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:6-11 The Pharisees were correct in the faith of the Jewish church. The Sadducees were no friends to the Scripture or Divine revelation; they denied a future state; they had neither hope of eternal happiness, nor dread of eternal misery. When called in question for his being a Christian, Paul might truly say he was called in question for the hope of the resurrection of the dead. It was justifiable in him, by this profession of his opinion on that disputed point, to draw off the Pharisees from persecuting him, and to lead them to protect him from this unlawful violence. How easily can God defend his own cause! Though the Jews seemed to be perfectly agreed in their conspiracy against religion, yet they were influenced by very different motives. There is no true friendship among the wicked, and in a moment, and with the utmost ease, God can turn their union into open enmity. Divine consolations stood Paul in the most stead; the chief captain rescued him out of the hands of cruel men, but the event he could not tell. Whoever is against us, we need not fear, if the Lord stand by us. It is the will of Christ, that his servants who are faithful, should be always cheerful. He might think he should never see Rome; but God tells him, even in that he should be gratified, since he desired to go there only for the honour of Christ, and to do good.</body></html>
