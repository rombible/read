The whole utterance must be regarded by St. Paul's own confession as the expression of a hasty indignation, recalled after a moment's reflection; but the words so spoken were actually a prophecy, fulfilled some years after by the death of Ananias by the hands of the <span class= "ital">sicarii.</span> (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, ii.</span> 17, ?? 2-9).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">for</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">according to</span> for <span class="accented">after</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">God shall smite thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). A distinct announcement of something that would happen. (For the incident itself, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15, 17</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1, 2, 23</a>) Ananias perished by the daggers of the Sicarii (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud,' 2. 17:9), at the beginning of the Jewish war under the procuratorship of Florus, in the year A.D. . He had been previously deposed from the high priesthood by King Agrippa toward the close of the government of Felix ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:8), about A.D. , or early in A.D. , less than two years from the present time. <span class="cmt_word">Thou whited wall</span>. This expression is admirably illustrated by the quotations from Seneca in Kuinoel: "These base and sordid spirits are like the walls of their own houses, only beautiful on the outside." "What are our gilt roofs hut lies? for we well know that under the gilding unseemly beams are concealed." "It is not only our walls which are coated with a thin outward ornament; the greatness of those men whom you see strutting in their pride is mere tinsel; look beneath the surface, and you will see all the evil that is hid under that thin crust of dignity" ('De Provid.,' 6, and 'Epist.' 115). Ananias was sitting in his priestly robes of office, presiding over the council in power and dignity, and presumably a righteous judge, but his heart within was polluted with injustice, selfishness, and a corrupt disposition, which made him act unrighteously (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Contrary to the Law</span>; or, <span class="accented">acting illegally</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, only found here in the New Testament, but common in classical Greek. St. Paul's temper was very excusably roused by the brutality and injustice of Ananias. But we may, perhaps, think that he did not quite attain to "the mind that was in Christ Jesus," who "when he was reviled, reviled not again," but was "led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, he opened not his mouth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-5 See here the character of an honest man. He sets God before him, and lives as in his sight. He makes conscience of what he says and does, and, according to the best of his knowledge, he keeps from whatever is evil, and cleaves to what is good. He is conscientious in all his words and conduct. Those who thus live before God, may, like Paul, have confidence both toward God and man. Though the answer of Paul contained a just rebuke and prediction, he seems to have been too angry at the treatment he received in uttering them. Great men may be told of their faults, and public complaints may be made in a proper manner; but the law of God requires respect for those in authority.</body></html>
