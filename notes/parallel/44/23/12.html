So, they may have argued, Mattathias, the founder of the Maccabean dynasty, had slain the apostate Jew who offered sacrifice at the altar at Modin (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-24.htm" title="Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal, and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his anger according to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him upon the altar.">1 Maccabees 2:24</a>); so ten Zealots of Jerusalem had conspired to assassinate Herod the Great because he had built an amphi-theatre and held gladiatorial games in the Holy City (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xii.</span> 6, ? 2; xv. 8, ? 3). It is melancholy but instructive to remember how often the casuistry of Christian theologians has run in the same groove. In this respect the Jesuit teaching, absolving subjects from their allegiance to heretic rulers, and the practical issue of that teaching in the history of the Gunpowder Plot, and of the murders perpetrated by Clement and Ravaillac, present only too painful a parallel. Those who now thus acted were probably of the number of the Zealots, or Sicarii.<p><span class= "bld">Under a curse.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">they placed themselves under an anathema.</span> This was the Jewish <span class= "ital">kherem, </span>and the person or thing on which it fell was regarded as devoted to the wrath of God. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" title="If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.">1Corinthians 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/1-8.htm" title="But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:8-9</a>.) So also in the Old Testament we find that Jericho and all that it contained was a <span class= "ital">kherem, </span>or accursed thing, devoted to destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm" title="But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.">Joshua 7:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- The Jews</span> for <span class="accented">certain of the Jews</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Banded together</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>). This word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> is found in the New Testament only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-40.htm">Acts 19:40</a>, where it is rendered "concourse." The sense of "a conspiracy," which it has here, is common in the LXX. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-15.htm">2 Kings 15:15</a>, etc.).

The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<span class="accented">Romans</span> 9:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a>) corresponds to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span>, the devotion of anything to destruction; and hence "the thing itself so devoted." And the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> corresponds to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span>, to devote to destruction, without the possibility of redemption. Here they made themselves an <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> if they did not kill Paul before partaking of any food. It seems, however, that there was a way of escape if they failed to keep the vow. Lightfoot, on this passage, quotes from the Talmud: "He that hath made a vow not to eat anything, woe to him if he eat, and woe to him if he do not eat. If he eat he sinneth against his vow; if he do not eat he sinneth against his life. What must such a man do in this case? Let him go to the wise men, and they will loose his vow" ('Hebrews and Talmud. Exercit. upon the Acts'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:12-24 False religious principles, adopted by carnal men, urge on to such wickedness, as human nature would hardly be supposed capable of. Yet the Lord readily disappoints the best concerted schemes of iniquity. Paul knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudent means; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, he could not expect God's providence to work on his behalf. He who will not help himself according to his means and power, has neither reason nor revelation to assure him that he shall receive help from God. Believing in the Lord, we and ours shall be kept from every evil work, and kept to his kingdom. Heavenly Father, give us by thy Holy Spirit, for Christ's sake, this precious faith.</body></html>
