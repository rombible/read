(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-6.htm" title="And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.">Acts 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a>.) So shackled, he was taken before the Chiliarch Lysias for a preliminary inquiry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="accented">- Laid hold on</span> for <span class="accented">took</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">inquired</span> for. <span class="accented">demanded</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Laid hold on</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-19.htm">Acts 17:19</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Bound with two chains</span>; as St. Peter was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-6.htm">Acts 12:6</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> means properly "a chain on the hands" as opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;</span>, a fetter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-4.htm">Mark 5:4</a>); and therefore the two chains are not to be understood of chains on his hands and feet, with Kuinoel, but, as in the case of Peter, of chains fastening him to a soldier on both hands. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:27-40 In the temple, where Paul should have been protected as in a place of safety, he was violently set upon. They falsely charged him with ill doctrine and ill practice against the Mosaic ceremonies. It is no new thing for those who mean honestly and act regularly, to have things laid to their charge which they know not and never thought of. It is common for the wise and good to have that charged against them by malicious people, with which they thought to have obliged them. God often makes those a protection to his people, who have no affection to them, but only have compassion for sufferers, and regard to the public peace. And here see what false, mistaken notions of good people and good ministers, many run away with. But God seasonably interposes for the safety of his servants, from wicked and unreasonable men; and gives them opportunities to speak for themselves, to plead for the Redeemer, and to spread abroad his glorious gospel.</body></html>
