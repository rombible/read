It is interesting to note the revival of the old prophetic manner of predicting by symbolic acts. So Isaiah had walked "naked and barefoot" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/20-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder on Egypt and on Ethiopia;">Isaiah 20:3-4</a>); and Jeremiah had gone and left his girdle in a cave on the banks of the Euphrates, and had made bonds and yokes, and had put them on his neck (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/13-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me, Go and get you a linen girdle, and put it on your loins, and put it not in water.">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Make you bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,">Jeremiah 27:2</a>); and Ezekiel had portrayed the siege of Jerusalem on a tile, and had cut the hair from his head and beard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/4-1.htm" title="You also, son of man, take you a tile, and lay it before you, and portray on it the city, even Jerusalem:">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/5-1.htm" title="And you, son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barber's razor, and cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.">Ezekiel 5:1-4</a>). Looking to the previous relations between St. Paul and Agabus at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27</a>), we may well believe that the latter, foreseeing the danger to which the Apostle would be exposed, came down to Caesarea, in a spirit of friendly anxiety, to warn him not to come. The feeling which led to the murderous plot of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-12.htm" title="And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.">Acts 23:12</a> could be no secret to a prophet living at Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Coming to</span> for <span class="accented">when he was come unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and taking</span> for <span class="accented">he took</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he bound</span> for <span class="accented">and bound</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">feet and hands</span> for <span class="accented">hands and feet</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Bound his own feet</span>, etc. The R.T. has <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> which leaves no doubt that Agabus bound his own hands and feet. The reading of the T.R., <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, would rather indicate Paul's hands and feet, as Grotius, Hammond, and others take it, though less conformably to the context. (For similar symbolical actions of the old prophets, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-3.htm">Ezekiel 12:3-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-16.htm">Ezekiel 24:16-24</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">Shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles</span>. Nearly the same words as those in which our Lord foretold his own betrayal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:8-18 Paul had express warning of his troubles, that when they came, they might be no surprise or terror to him. The general notice given us, that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God, should be of the same use to us. Their weeping began to weaken and slacken his resolution Has not our Master told us to take up our cross? It was a trouble to him, that they should so earnestly press him to do that in which he could not gratify them without wronging his conscience. When we see trouble coming, it becomes us to say, not only, The will of the Lord must be done, and there is no remedy; but, Let the will of the Lord be done; for his will is his wisdom, and he doeth all according to the counsel of it. When a trouble is come, this must allay our griefs, that the will of the Lord is done; when we see it coming, this must silence our fears, that the will of the Lord shall be done; and we ought to say, Amen, let it be done. It is honourable to be an old disciple of Jesus Christ, to have been enabled by the grace of God to continue long in a course of duty, stedfast in the faith, growing more and more experienced, to a good old age. And with these old disciples one would choose to lodge; for the multitude of their years shall teach wisdom. Many brethren at Jerusalem received Paul gladly. We think, perhaps, that if we had him among us, we should gladly receive him; but we should not, if, having his doctrine, we do not gladly receive that.</body></html>
