He may accordingly have been among those "men of Cyprus" who came to Antioch, and were among the first to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>.) We may fairly infer that he was one of those who had been "from the beginning" among the eye-witnesses and ministers of the word to whom St. Luke refers as his informants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-2.htm" title="Even as they delivered them to us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;">Luke 1:2</a>). If so, it is interesting, as showing that our Lord's disciples were not limited to the natives of Galilee and Judaea. It lies on the surface of the narrative that Mnason had a house at Jerusalem in which he could receive St. Paul and his companions. The arrangement seems to have been made as the best course that could be taken to minimise the inevitable danger to which the Apostle was exposing himself. In that house at least he might be sure of personal safety, and the men from Caesarea would form a kind of escort as he went to and fro in the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- And there went</span> for <span class="accented">there went</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">bringing</span> for <span class="accented">and brought</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">early</span> for <span class="accented">old</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Mnason of Cyprus</span>; only mentioned here. He may very probably be one of those Cypriots mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19, 20</a>, and so have been a disciple before the death of Stephen, and hence properly called <span class="accented">an old</span> or <span class="accented">early</span> disciple. If he had been one of St. Paul's converts in the visit to Cyprus recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>, St. Paul would have needed no introduction to him. The construction of the sentence is involved, and the exact meaning consequently obscure. Kuincel, Meyer, Howson (in 'Dict. of Bible'), and many more, translate it "conducting us to Mnason," etc., which seems the better translation; not, however, so as to make <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, which Greek usage will not admit of, but explaining the dative by attraction of the relative <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>, which is governed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>. If it had not been for the intervening <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, the sentence would have run <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>. If Mnason, who, consistently with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>, had a house at Jerusalem, had been at Caesarea at this time, it would be quite unmeaning that disciples from Caesarea should bring Mnason with them. The sentence would rather have run "among whom was Mnason," etc. But if he was at Jerusalem, it was quite proper that any Christians of Caesarea who knew him should conduct Paul to his house, and introduce him and his party to him. Mnason, like Philip (ver. 6, note), was evidently a man of substance, <span class="cmt_word">Should lodge</span>; should be hospitably entertained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-6.htm">Acts 10:6, 18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:8-18 Paul had express warning of his troubles, that when they came, they might be no surprise or terror to him. The general notice given us, that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God, should be of the same use to us. Their weeping began to weaken and slacken his resolution Has not our Master told us to take up our cross? It was a trouble to him, that they should so earnestly press him to do that in which he could not gratify them without wronging his conscience. When we see trouble coming, it becomes us to say, not only, The will of the Lord must be done, and there is no remedy; but, Let the will of the Lord be done; for his will is his wisdom, and he doeth all according to the counsel of it. When a trouble is come, this must allay our griefs, that the will of the Lord is done; when we see it coming, this must silence our fears, that the will of the Lord shall be done; and we ought to say, Amen, let it be done. It is honourable to be an old disciple of Jesus Christ, to have been enabled by the grace of God to continue long in a course of duty, stedfast in the faith, growing more and more experienced, to a good old age. And with these old disciples one would choose to lodge; for the multitude of their years shall teach wisdom. Many brethren at Jerusalem received Paul gladly. We think, perhaps, that if we had him among us, we should gladly receive him; but we should not, if, having his doctrine, we do not gladly receive that.</body></html>
