Here the meaning is that, as soon as they <span class= "ital">sighted</span> Cyprus, they stood to the southeast, and so had it on their left as they continued their voyage to Syria. At Tyre they had again to change their ship. On the position and history of Tyre, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm" title="Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.">Matthew 11:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">when</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">come in sight of</span> for <span class="accented">discovered</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">leaving it... we sailed</span> for <span class="accented">we left it... and sailed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Had come in sight of</span>; literally, <span class="accented">had been shown Cyprus</span>; had had Cyprus made visible to us; <span class="accented">i.e. had sighted Cyprus.</span> It is a nautical expression. Meyer compares the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> for the grammatical construction. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is peculiar to St. Luke, occur-tug elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11</a>.

Tyre at this time was still a city of some commercial importance, with two harbors, one north and one south of the causeway which connected the island with the mainland (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>). Howson thinks the ship in which St. Paul sailed may have brought wheat from the Black Sea, and taken up Phoenician wares in exchange. The sight of Cyprus as he sailed by must have brought many and very various memories to the apostle's mind, of Barnabas, of Sergius Paulus, of Elymas, and many others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-7 Providence must be acknowledged when our affairs go on well. Wherever Paul came, he inquired what disciples were there, and found them out. Foreseeing his troubles, from love to him, and concern for the church, they wrongly thought it would be most for the glory of God that he should continue at liberty; but their earnestness to dissuade him from it, renders his pious resolution the more illustrious. He has taught us by example, as well as by rule, to pray always, to pray without ceasing. Their last farewell was sweetened with prayer.</body></html>
