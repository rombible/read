They cannot refer, as some have thought, either to the duration of the vow, which was never less than thirty days, or to that of the Feast of Pentecost, which at this time was never extended beyond one, and must therefore be understood of the period of special purification which came at the final stage of the fulfilment of the vow.<p><span class= "bld">The Jews which were of Asia . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">from Asia</span>--those who had come up to keep the Feast at Jerusalem. They, we may well believe, had been watching the Apostle eagerly as he passed in and out of the courts of the Temple. As it was, they seized him, with all the tokens of his purification still upon him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-18.htm" title="Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.">Acts 24:18</a>), about to offer sacrifices, and raised a cry which was sure t<span class= "ital">o</span> throw the whole city into an uproar. They first reiterate the general charge, and in doing so bring against St. Paul, in almost identical terms, the very accusation which he had brought against Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/6-11.htm" title="Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.">Acts 6:11-13</a>), of which they thus make themselves the witnesses. This was backed up by a more specific indictment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-28.htm" title="Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.">Acts 21:28</a>). He had brought Greeks--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> uncircumcised Gentiles--into the Holy Place--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>beyond the middle wall of partition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>) which divided the court that was open to strangers from that which none but Jews might enter (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 11, ? 5). The recent excavations of the Palestine Exploration Society (<span class= "ital">Report</span> for 1871, p. 132) have brought to light a slab with an inscription, discovered and deciphered by M. Clermont Ganneau, which illustrates the horror with which the Jews looked on such a profanation. Its contents show that it must have formed part of the low wall just mentioned:--"NO MAN OF ALIEN RACE IS TO ENTER WITHIN THE BALUSTRADE AND FENCE THAT GOES ROUND THE TEMPLE. IF ANY ONE IS TAKEN IN THE ACT, LET HIM KNOW THAT HE HAS HIMSELF TO BLAME FOR THE PENALTY OF DEATH THAT FOLLOWS." This, accordingly, was the punishment which the Jews of Asia were now seeking to bring on St. Paul and on his friends.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> <span class="accented">- Completed</span> for <span class="accented">ended</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">which were of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">multitude</span> for <span class="accented">people</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The seven days</span>; showing clearly that some customary term of preparation for the offerings and shaving of the head is meant.

They falsely charged him with ill doctrine and ill practice against the Mosaic ceremonies. It is no new thing for those who mean honestly and act regularly, to have things laid to their charge which they know not and never thought of. It is common for the wise and good to have that charged against them by malicious people, with which they thought to have obliged them. God often makes those a protection to his people, who have no affection to them, but only have compassion for sufferers, and regard to the public peace. And here see what false, mistaken notions of good people and good ministers, many run away with. But God seasonably interposes for the safety of his servants, from wicked and unreasonable men; and gives them opportunities to speak for themselves, to plead for the Redeemer, and to spread abroad his glorious gospel.</body></html>
