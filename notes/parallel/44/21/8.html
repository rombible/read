In some of the MSS. in which it is found, the verb is in the third person: "They that were of Paul's company came . . . ."<p><span class= "bld">Came unto Caesarea.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm" title="But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.">Acts 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm" title="There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,">Acts 10:1</a>. This was, it will be remembered, St. Paul's third visit there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm" title="Which when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.">Acts 9:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a>), and we may well believe that he was simply renewing the intercourse of a previous friendship with Philip.<p><span class= "bld">Philip the evangelist.</span>--The title given to him is interesting as showing that the work of "serving tables," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of superintending the distribution of alms, had been merged in the higher work of a missionary preacher. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm" title="Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.">Acts 6:3</a>.) He was no longer known, if, indeed, that title had ever been applied to him, as Philip the deacon, but as Philip the evangelist. The office so described is recognised by St. Paul in his enumeration of spiritual gifts and functions, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a>, as coming next in order of importance to those of apostles and prophets, and before pastors and teachers. It would seem, accordingly, to have been distinct from the "orders," in the later sense, of presbyter or deacon, though capable of being united with either of them. Timotheus was exhorted by St. Paul when he was left at Ephesus, with the authority of a bishop, or, more strictly, of a vicar apostolic, to "do the work of an evangelist," as that to which he had been called (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>). It followed, from the nature of the office, as analogous to that of the missionary of later times, that, though residing mainly at Caesarea, Philip's labours extended beyond its limits; and we have seen reason to trace his work (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm" title="But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.">Acts 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm" title="And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brothers.">Acts 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-3.htm" title="Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.">Acts 21:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-7.htm" title="And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.">Acts 21:7</a>) all along the coasts of Palestine and Phoenicia. As far as we know, Philip and St. Luke had not met before, and we can imagine the satisfaction with which the latter, himself, probably, an evangelist in both senses of the word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2Corinthians 8:18</a>), and already contemplating his work as an historian, would welcome the acquaintance of the former, how he would ask many questions as to the early history of the Church, and learn from him all, or nearly all, that we find in the first eleven chapters of this book.<p><span class= "bld">Which was one of the seven.</span>--We note how entirely the Seven of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm" title="Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.">Acts 6:3</a> are regarded as a special or distinct body. If the term deacon had ever been applied to them, which is very doubtful, it ceased to be applicable by its wide extension to the subordinate functionaries of the churches throughout the empire.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- On the morrow</span> for <span class="accented">the next day</span> A.V.; <span class="accented">we</span> for <span class="accented">we that were of Paul's company</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">entering we</span> for <span class="accented">we entered</span>... <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">who</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Caesarea</span>.

When last we heard of him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>) he had just reached Caesarea; apparently he had been working there as an evangelist ever since. His old home at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>) had been broken up by the persecution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5</a>), and thus the deacon had become an evangelist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>). <span class="accented">Evangelists</span> are mentioned by St. Paul(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>) as one of the higher orders of the Christian ministry; and Timothy is bid "do the work of an evangelist" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>). In later times the term was restricted to the four writers of the Gospels. Philip's old association with Stephen in the diaconate must have been keenly remembered by St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">We abode with him</span>. This seems to imply that Philip was well to do, and had a good house. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:8-18 Paul had express warning of his troubles, that when they came, they might be no surprise or terror to him. The general notice given us, that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God, should be of the same use to us. Their weeping began to weaken and slacken his resolution Has not our Master told us to take up our cross? It was a trouble to him, that they should so earnestly press him to do that in which he could not gratify them without wronging his conscience. When we see trouble coming, it becomes us to say, not only, The will of the Lord must be done, and there is no remedy; but, Let the will of the Lord be done; for his will is his wisdom, and he doeth all according to the counsel of it. When a trouble is come, this must allay our griefs, that the will of the Lord is done; when we see it coming, this must silence our fears, that the will of the Lord shall be done; and we ought to say, Amen, let it be done. It is honourable to be an old disciple of Jesus Christ, to have been enabled by the grace of God to continue long in a course of duty, stedfast in the faith, growing more and more experienced, to a good old age. And with these old disciples one would choose to lodge; for the multitude of their years shall teach wisdom. Many brethren at Jerusalem received Paul gladly. We think, perhaps, that if we had him among us, we should gladly receive him; but we should not, if, having his doctrine, we do not gladly receive that.</body></html>
