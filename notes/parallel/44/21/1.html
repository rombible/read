It would hardly be within the scope of a Commentary to enter at length into the history of each place. It will be enough to note that Coos was famous both for its wines and its silk fabrics, of fine and almost transparent tissue; that Rhodes, then famous for its Colossus, was one of the largest and most flourishing islands of the Archipelago, and is memorable for us in later history as connected with the history of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John; that Patara was a harbour on the coast of Lycia. For this harbour the ship in which the travellers had left Troas and Miletus was bound, and they had therefore to look out for another.

"Non sine desiderio magno" (Bengel). "He shows the violence of the parting by saying, ' Having torn ourselves away '" (Chrysostom). The word is properly applied to those who have been unwillingly torn away from their friends (Schleusner and Kuinoel); "denotes the painful separation wrung from them by necessity" (Meyer) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a> it was used in the active voice of false teachers "drawing away" the disciples, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christians, after them. In 2 Macc. 12:10 it means simply" withdrawn," and so perhaps also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a>, though Meyer thinks that St. Luke chose the unusual word to denote the urgent emotion by which our Lord was as it were compelled to leave the companionship of the apostles, and be alone. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> (whence spasm) and its derivatives, of which Luke uses four - two of which are peculiar to him - are much employed by medical writers, as Hippocrates, Galen, Antaeus, etc. (Hobart, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22.htm">Luke 22</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">Had set sail</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>). The word means" to go up to the sea from the land," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-11.htm">Acts 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; just as, on the contrary, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;</span> of coming down to land from the sea (see ver. 3 in the T.R., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-3.htm">Acts 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-12.htm">Acts 28:12</a>). The same conception of putting out to sea being a going up, led to the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (high up) being applied to ships out at sea. From <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> comes, of course, our word "meteor." <span class="cmt_word">Cos</span>, or <span class="accented">Coos</span>, for it is written both ways, now called by the Turks <span class="accented">Stanko</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1ff6;</span>), a beautiful island, nearly opposite the Gulf of Halicarnassus, and separated from Cnidus by a narrow strait, about six hours' sail from Miletus. There is a city of the same name on its eastern coast. It was one of the six Dorian colonies which formed the confederation called the Dorian Hexapolis. It was famous for its wine and its textile fabrics (Howson, and Lewin, and 'Dict. of Geog.'). <span class="cmt_word">Rhodes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); perhaps the "Isle of Roses;" the well-known mountainous island in the AEgean Sea, which lies nine or ten miles from the coast of Carts. Its inhabitants were Dorians, and it was one of the places which claimed the honor of being the birthplace of Homer. The towns are all situated on the seacoast, "Rhodes was the last Christian city to make a stand against the Saracens" (Howson). <span class="cmt_word">Patara</span> ([<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). A flourishing commercial city on the south-west coast of Lycia, with a good harbor. It was the port of Xauthus, the capital of Lycia. The name <span class="accented">Patera</span> is still attached to some extensive ruins on the seashore not far from the river Xanthus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-7 Providence must be acknowledged when our affairs go on well. Wherever Paul came, he inquired what disciples were there, and found them out. Foreseeing his troubles, from love to him, and concern for the church, they wrongly thought it would be most for the glory of God that he should continue at liberty; but their earnestness to dissuade him from it, renders his pious resolution the more illustrious. He has taught us by example, as well as by rule, to pray always, to pray without ceasing. Their last farewell was sweetened with prayer.</body></html>
