It was the spot where the two sets of friends were to part. It was removed from the stir and bustle of the city. We may add that it fell in with the common Jewish practice of using the banks of rivers or the seashore as a place of prayer. The beach of Tyre became for the time a <span class= "ital">proseuche.</span> (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-13.htm" title="And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither.">Acts 16:13</a>.) It seems implied, from the use of the plural, that in this instance St. Paul was not the only spokesman of the prayers, but that others also (probably St. Luke himself, and the leading members of the Church of Tyre) joined in reciprocal intercession.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- It came to pass that we had accomplished</span> for <span class="accented">we had accomplished</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the days</span> for <span class="accented">those days</span>, A.V.; on <span class="accented">our journey</span> for <span class="accented">our way</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way</span> for <span class="accented">they all brought us on our way, with wires and children</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">kneeling down on the beach we prayed</span> for <span class="accented">we kneeled down on the shore and prayed.</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Accomplished the days</span>.

R.V. Hence some would render the passage here "when we had refitted (the ship) during these days." But this is a very harsh construction, and it is better, with the glossaries, lexicons, the Vulgate, and most commentators, to take the word here in the unusual sense of "to complete," applied to time. <span class="accented">The days</span> are the seven days mentioned in ver. 4, which were probably determined by the time it took to unlade the ship and get the new cargo on board. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-7 Providence must be acknowledged when our affairs go on well. Wherever Paul came, he inquired what disciples were there, and found them out. Foreseeing his troubles, from love to him, and concern for the church, they wrongly thought it would be most for the glory of God that he should continue at liberty; but their earnestness to dissuade him from it, renders his pious resolution the more illustrious. He has taught us by example, as well as by rule, to pray always, to pray without ceasing. Their last farewell was sweetened with prayer.</body></html>
