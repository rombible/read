They inquired, when they landed, amid the crowded streets of the still busy port, whether any Christians were to be found there. It will be remembered that St. Paul had passed through that region at least once before. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm" title="And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brothers.">Acts 15:3</a>.) The church had probably been planted by the labours of Philip, as the Evangelist of Caesarea. It is clear that the believers there were prepared to welcome St. Paul and his companions, and showed a warm interest in their welfare.<p>The "seven days' " stay, as at Troas (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>), and afterwards at Puteoli (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-14.htm" title="Where we found brothers, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.">Acts 28:14</a>), was obviously for the purpose of attending one, or possibly more than one, meeting of the church for the Lord's Supper on the Lord's Day. The utterances through the Spirit implied the exercise of prophetic gifts at such a meeting. It seems, at first, somewhat startling that St. Paul should reject what is described as an inspired counsel; or, if we believe him also to have been guided by the Spirit, that the two inspirations should thus clash. We remember, however, that men received the Spirit "by measure," and the prophets of the churches at Tyre, as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm" title="Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.">Acts 20:23</a>), though foreseeing the danger to which the Apostle was exposed, might yet be lacking in that higher inspiration which guided the decision of the Apostle, and which he himself defines as the spirit "of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-7.htm" title="For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.">2Timothy 1:7</a>). This is, it is believed, a much more adequate explanation than that which sees in the Apostle's conduct a somewhat self-willed adherence to his own human purpose, and finds a chastisement for that self-will in the long delay and imprisonment that followed on the slighted warnings. He was right, we may boldly say, to go to Jerusalem in spite of consequences. The repeated warnings are, however, an indication of the exceeding bitterness of feeling with which the Judaisers and unbelieving Jews were known to be animated against him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Having found the disciples</span> for <span class="accented">finding disciples</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and these</span> for <span class="accented">who</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">set foot in</span> for <span class="accented">go up to</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Having found the disciples</span>, If the R.T. is right, the meaning is that they had sought out the Christians, apparently not a large body, scattered in the city, and perhaps with some difficulty found them and their place of meeting. This would look as if they were not Jews, as the synagogue was always known. <span class="cmt_word">He should not set foot in Jerusalem</span>. The R.T. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. It is true that, in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-36.htm">Deuteronomy 1:36</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span> means "The land that he hath trodden upon;" and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a> again, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> means "Every place on which you shall tread with the sole of your feet;" but the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;</span> must surely mean simply "to go to Jerusalem." <span class="cmt_word">Through the Spirit</span>. The Holy Spirit revealed to them, as he did to many ethers (ver. 11 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>), that bonds and affliction awaited St. Paul at Jerusalem. The inference that he should not go to Jerusalem was their own. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-7 Providence must be acknowledged when our affairs go on well. Wherever Paul came, he inquired what disciples were there, and found them out. Foreseeing his troubles, from love to him, and concern for the church, they wrongly thought it would be most for the glory of God that he should continue at liberty; but their earnestness to dissuade him from it, renders his pious resolution the more illustrious. He has taught us by example, as well as by rule, to pray always, to pray without ceasing. Their last farewell was sweetened with prayer.</body></html>
