The numbers seem large if we think of the population of Jerusalem only, but the crowds that came from all quarters to the Feast of Pentecost (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1</a>) would fully justify the statement. The speaker here is obviously St. James, as the president of the assembly. There is no trace of the presence of any of the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">They are all zealous of the law.</span>--Better, the word being a substantive and not an adjective, <span class= "ital">zealots for the law.</span> The term was an almost technical one for the most rigid class of Pharisees. (See Note on Simon the Canaanite, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-4.htm" title="Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.">Matthew 10:4</a>.) So St. Paul describes himself as in this sense a "zealot" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm" title="I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.">Acts 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm" title="And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.">Galatians 1:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> <span class="accented">- They, when they heard it</span> for <span class="accented">when they heard it, they</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">God</span> for <span class="accented">the Lord</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">they said</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">there are among the Jews of them which have believed</span> for <span class="accented">of Jews there are which believe</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">for the Law</span> for <span class="accented">of the Law</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They... glorified God</span>. There is not the slightest symptom on the part of James and the elders of unfriendliness towards St. Paul, or jealousy or opposition to his work among the Gentiles (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7-9</a>). The appellation <span class="cmt_word">brother</span> is another indication of friendly feeling. <span class="cmt_word">Thousands</span> (Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, tens of thousands). These need not be deemed to be all Jerusalem Jews; if applied to the Church at Jerusalem only, such a word would be probably a gross exaggeration; but there were great numbers of Jews of the dispersion assembled at Jerusalem for Pentecost - probably all the Christian Jews of Judaea, and many from Syria, Galatia, Pontus, and the various countries enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9-11</a>. So that there might be several myriads of converted Jews altogether. <span class="cmt_word">All zealous for the Law</span>. This is a remarkable testimony to the unanimity of the Christian Jews in their attachment to the Law of Moses, and throws light upon the Epistle to the Galatians and many other passages in St. Paul's Epistles. It explains the great difficulty experienced in the early Church in dealing with converts from Judaism. <span class="accented">Zealous</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>). So the fierce sect of Zealots were called at the time of the Jewish wars (see Josephus, ' Bell. Jud.,' 4. 6:1, and elsewhere). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:19-26 Paul ascribed all his success to God, and to God they gave the praise. God had honoured him more than any of the apostles, yet they did not envy him; but on the contrary, glorified the Lord. They could not do more to encourage Paul to go on cheerfully in his work. James and the elders of the church at Jerusalem, asked Paul to gratify the believing Jews, by some compliance with the ceremonial law. They thought it was prudent in him to conform thus far. It was great weakness to be so fond of the shadows, when the substance was come. The religion Paul preached, tended not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it. He preached Christ, the end of the law for righteousness, and repentance and faith, in which we are to make great use of the law. The weakness and evil of the human heart strongly appear, when we consider how many, even of the disciples of Christ, had not due regard to the most eminent minister that even lived. Not the excellence of his character, nor the success with which God blessed his labours, could gain their esteem and affection, seeing that he did not render the same respect as themselves to mere ceremonial observances. How watchful should we be against prejudices! The apostles were not free from blame in all they did; and it would be hard to defend Paul from the charge of giving way too much in this matter. It is vain to attempt to court the favour of zealots, or bigots to a party. This compliance of Paul did not answer, for the very thing by which he hoped to pacify the Jews, provoked them, and brought him into trouble. But the all-wise God overruled both their advice and Paul's compliance with it, to serve a better purpose than was intended. It was in vain to think of pleasing men who would be pleased with nothing but the rooting out of Christianity. Integrity and uprightness will be more likely to preserve us than insincere compliances. And it should warn us not to press men to doing what is contrary to their own judgment to oblige us.</body></html>
