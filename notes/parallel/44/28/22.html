The speakers had clearly heard enough of the prisoner to identify him with that sect, but they treat him personally with respect, probably due in part to the favour which the authorities had shown him, and wish for an authoritative exposition of his views. The Christians of Rome had obviously, even if they were Jews, withdrawn from the Jewish quarter, and the residents in that quarter knew of them only by reports. What was the nature of those reports we can only conjecture. They were, as the speakers say, "everywhere spoken against." The darker calumnies which were propagated afterwards--stories of Thyestean (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>cannibal) banquets and licentious orgies--may possibly have been even then whispered from ear to ear. In any case the Christians of the empire would be known as abandoning circumcision and other Jewish ordinances, leading a separate life, holding meetings which were more or less secret, worshipping One who had been crucified as a malefactor. They were already, as Tacitus describes them, speaking of their sufferings under Nero, known as holding an <span class= "ital">exitiabilis superstitio</span> ("a detestable superstition"), guilty of <span class= "ital">atrocia et pudenda, odio humani generis convicti</span> ("atrocious and shameful crimes, convicted by the hatred of mankind") (<span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xv. 44), or as Suetonius writes (<span class= "ital">Nero, </span>c. 16), as a <span class= "ital">genus hominum superstitionis nov? et malefic?</span> ("a race of men holding a new and criminal superstition"). It is conceivable, looking to the early date at which such rumours were current, that even then there may have been caricatures like that which was found among the <span class= "ital">graffiti</span> of the Palace of the Caesars (now in the Collegio Romano), representing Alexamenos, a Christian convert, worshipping his god, in the form of a crucified human figure with an ass's head. Tertullian (A.D. 160-240) mentions such caricatures as current in his time (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> c. 16), and the story that the Jews worshipped an ass's head, which we know to have been accepted at this very time (Jos. <span class= "ital">cont. Apion.</span> ii. 7; Tacit <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> v. 4), would naturally be transferred to the Christians, who were regarded as a sect of Jews. In Tertullian's time <span class= "ital">Asinarii</span> ("ass-worshippers") was a common term of abuse for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="accented">It</span> <span class="accented">is known to us</span> for <span class="accented">we know</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We desire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); or, <span class="accented">we are willing</span>; literally, <span class="accented">think it right</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-38.htm">Acts 16:38</a>). <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, followed by a negative, means "was unwilling."

It is called a "superstitio prava, malefica, exitiabilis" (Pliny, 'Ep.,' 10:96; Suetonius, 'Nero,' 16; Tacitus, 'Annal.,' 15:44; 'Speaker's Commentary'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:17-22 It was for the honour of Paul that those who examined his case, acquitted him. In his appeal he sought not to accuse his nation, but only to clear himself. True Christianity settles what is of common concern to all mankind, and is not built upon narrow opinions and private interests. It aims at no worldly benefit or advantage, but all its gains are spiritual and eternal. It is, and always has been, the lot of Christ's holy religion, to be every where spoken against. Look through every town and village where Christ is exalted as the only Saviour of mankind, and where the people are called to follow him in newness of life, and we see those who give themselves up to Christ, still called a sect, a party, and reproached. And this is the treatment they are sure to receive, so long as there shall continue an ungodly man upon earth.</body></html>
