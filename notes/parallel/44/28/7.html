It appears that, with his usual accurate knowledge gained on the spot (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22</a>. note), St. Luke here gives to Publius his peculiar official title of <span class="accented">primus.</span> For Ciantar (1. 215), quoted by Smith, gives a Greek inscription on a marble, which in his day was standing near the gates of Citta Vecehia, in Malta, in which are the words, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., "Prudens, a Roman knight, <span class="accented">chief of the Maltese."</span> The Latin inscription, which was discovered in 1747, has the same title, MEL PRIMUS. "chief of the Maltese." It may not improbably be the Greek and Latin translation of the old Phoenician title of the "headman," in Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, in Chaldee <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in the title <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, the chief of the Captivity. When the Romans succeeded the Carthaginians in the possession of the island, they would be likely to perpetuate the title of the chief magistrate. In this case the chief was also a Roman, as his name of Publius indicates. Alford says that he was <span class="accented">legatus</span> to the Praetor of Sicily, and so 'Speaker's Commentary,' Kuinoel, Meyer, ere.' <span class="cmt_word">Received us</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, only here (and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17</a> in a different sense) for the more common <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.

We must understand the "us" probably to include the centurion, St. Paul, St. Luke, Aristarchus, and possibly one or two others, but not the whole two hundred and seventy-six. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> had a striking fulfillment here. During the three days they would have opportunity to procure suitable winter quarters. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 God can make strangers to be friends; friends in distress. Those who are despised for homely manners, are often more friendly than the more polished; and the conduct of heathens, or persons called barbarians, condemns many in civilized nations, professing to be Christians. The people thought that Paul was a murderer, and that the viper was sent by Divine justice, to be the avenger of blood. They knew that there is a God who governs the world, so that things do not come to pass by chance, no, not the smallest event, but all by Divine direction; and that evil pursues sinners; that there are good works which God will reward, and wicked works which he will punish. Also, that murder is a dreadful crime, one which shall not long go unpunished. But they thought all wicked people were punished in this life. Though some are made examples in this world, to prove that there is a God and a Providence, yet many are left unpunished, to prove that there is a judgment to come. They also thought all who were remarkably afflicted in this life were wicked people. Divine revelation sets this matter in a true light. Good men often are greatly afflicted in this life, for the trial and increase of their faith and patience. Observe Paul's deliverance from the danger. And thus in the strength of the grace of Christ, believers shake off the temptations of Satan, with holy resolution. When we despise the censures and reproaches of men, and look upon them with holy contempt, having the testimony of our consciences for us, then, like Paul, we shake off the viper into the fire. It does us no harm, except we are kept by it from our duty. God hereby made Paul remarkable among these people, and so made way for the receiving of the gospel. The Lord raises up friends for his people in every place whither he leads them, and makes them blessings to those in affliction.</body></html>
