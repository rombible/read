(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-23.htm" title="And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, You shall not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.">2Samuel 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-9.htm" title="So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.">2Kings 3:9</a>, and--<p>"For 'tis his custom, like a creeping fool,<p>To fetch a compass of a mile about, "<p>in Heywood's <span class= "ital">Fair Maid of the Exchange, </span>ii. 3.) It is found in most of the English versions, but Wiclif gives "we sailed about," and the Rhemish, "compassing by the shore." The latter, however, hardly expresses the fact, which was that the wind being probably from the west, they were compelled to tack so as to stand out from the shore to catch the breeze, instead of coasting.<p><span class= "bld">Came to Rhegium.</span>--This town, now <span class= "ital">Reggio, </span>was in Italy, on the southern opening of the Straits of Messina. Ships from Alexandria to Italy commonly touched there, and Suetonius relates that the Emperor Titus, taking the same course as St. Paul, put in there on his way from Judaea to Puteoli, and thence to Rome. Caligula began the construction of a harbour at Rhegium for the corn-ships of Egypt; but this work, which the Jewish historian notes as the one "great and kingly undertaking" of his reign, was left unfinished (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xix. 2, ? 5).<p><span class= "bld">The south wind blew.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">when a breeze from, the south had sprung,</span> the form of the Greek verb implying a change of wind. The south wind was, of course, directly in their favour, and they sailed without danger between the famous rocks of Scylla and the whirlpool of Charybdis.<p><span class= "bld">We came the next day to Puteoli.</span>--As the distance was about one hundred and eighty miles, the ship was clearly making good way before the wind. Puteoli (more anciently Dikaearchia, now <span class= "ital">Pozzuoli</span>) lies in a sheltered recess, forming the northern part of the Bay of Naples. It was at this time the chief port of Rome, and was, in particular, the great emporium for the corn ships of Alexandria, upon which the people of Rome largely depended for their food, and the arrival of which was accordingly eagerly welcomed. A pier on twenty-five arches was thrown out into the sea for the protection of the harbour. It may be noted further that but a few months prior to St. Paul's arrival it had been raised to the dignity of a <span class= "ital">colonia</span> (Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xiv. 27). It is hardly necessary to describe the well-known beauties of the bay, but the reader may be reminded that as the ship entered it the eye of St. Paul must have rested on the point of Misenum, to the north, behind which was stationed the imperial fleet; on Vesuvius, to the south; on the town of Neapolis (= New-town), now <span class= "ital">Naples</span>, which had taken the place of the old Parthenope; on the islands of Capreae, Ischia, and Procida.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Made a circuit</span> for <span class="accented">fetched a compass</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">arrived at</span> for <span class="accented">came to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a south</span> for <span class="accented">the south</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sprang up</span> for <span class="accented">blew</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">on</span> <span class="accented">the second day we came</span> for <span class="accented">we came the next day</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We made a circuit</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Luke only uses this word in one other passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>," The strolling [or, 'vagabond'] Jews;" and it has the same sense of "wandering" in the only other passages where it occurs in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-13.htm">1 Timothy 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>). If it is the right reading here, the meaning must be "tacking," the wind not allowing them to sail in a direct course. "I am inclined to suppose that the wind was north-west, and that they worked to windward, availing themselves of the sinuosities of the coast. But with this wind they could not proceed through the Straits of Messina .... They were, therefore, obliged to put into Rhegium But after one day the wind became fair (from the south), and on the following day they arrived at Puteoli, having accomplished about one hundred and eighty nautical miles in less than two days" (Smith, p. 156). But Meyer explains it, "after we had come round," viz. from Syracuse, round the eastern coast of Sicily. Lewin thinks they had to stand out to sea to catch the wind, and so arrived at Rhegium by a circuitous course. The other reading is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-40.htm">Acts 27:40</a>; but this seems to give no proper sense here. <span class="cmt_word">A south wind sprang up</span>. The force of the preposition in <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> shows that there was a change of wind. The south wind would, of course, be a very favorable one for sailing from Reggio to Puzzuoli. Hobart remarks of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (which is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-27.htm">Acts 27:27</a>, according to some good manuscripts) that it "was a favorite medical word constantly employed to denote the coming on of an attack of illness." It occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but is common in Diodorus Siculus, Xenophon, Herodotus, Thucydides, etc., for the coming on of a storm, wind (adverse or favorable), or any other change. <span class="cmt_word">On the second day</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>.

Puteoli; now <span class="accented">Puzzuoli.</span> The Italian port to which ships from Alexandria usually came. Smith quotes a passage from Seneca (Epist., 77) describing the arrival of the Alexandrian wheat-ships at Puteoli. The whole population of Puteoli went out to see them sail into harbor with their topsails (<span class="accented">supparum</span>), which they alone were allowed to carry, in order to hasten their arrival (p. 157), so important to Italy was the corn trade with Alexandria. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:11-16 The common events of travelling are seldom worthy of being told; but the comfort of communion with the saints, and kindness shown by friends, deserve particular mention. The Christians at Rome were so far from being ashamed of Paul, or afraid of owning him, because he was a prisoner, that they were the more careful to show him respect. He had great comfort in this. And if our friends are kind to us, God puts it into their hearts, and we must give him the glory. When we see those even in strange places, who bear Christ's name, fear God, and serve him, we should lift up our hearts to heaven in thanksgiving. How many great men have made their entry into Rome, crowned and in triumph, who really were plagues to the world! But here a good man makes his entry into Rome, chained as a poor captive, who was a greater blessing to the world than any other merely a man. Is not this enough to put us for ever out of conceit with worldly favour? This may encourage God's prisoners, that he can give them favour in the eyes of those that carry them captives. When God does not soon deliver his people out of bondage, yet makes it easy to them, or them easy under it, they have reason to be thankful.</body></html>
