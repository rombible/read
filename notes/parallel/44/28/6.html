Prestes ("the inflamer"), from it. Lucan (ix. 790) describes the effect of its bite--<p>"Percussit Prestes, illi ruber igneus ora<p>Succendit, tenditque cutem, pereunte figura."<p>[" The Prestes bit him, and a fiery flush<p>Lit up his face, and set the skin a-stretch,<p>And all its comely grace had passed away."]<p><span class= "bld">They changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</span>--The miraculous escape naturally made an even stronger impression on the minds of the Melitese than what had seemed a supernatural judgment. Their thoughts may have travelled quickly to the attributes of the deities who, like Apollo or 'sculapius, were depicted as subduing serpents. The sudden change of belief may be noted as presenting a kind of inverted parallelism with that which had come over the people of Lystra. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-11.htm" title="And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.">Acts 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm" title="And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.">Acts 14:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- But they expected that he would</span> for <span class="accented">howbeit, they looked when he should</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">when they were long in expectation</span> for <span class="accented">after they had looked a great while</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">beheld nothing amiss</span> for <span class="accented">stay no harm</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They expected</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. This word is used eleven times by St. Luke, twice by St. Matthew, and three times in the Second Epistle of Peter (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-5.htm">Acts 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-21.htm">Luke 1:21</a>, etc.). It is also common in the LXX. But it is a word much employed by medical writers in speaking of the course they <span class="accented">expect</span> a disease to take, and the results they look for. And this is the more remarkable here because there are no fewer than three other medical phrases in this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">be</span>sides those immediately preceding <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (according to several good manuscripts and editions) <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. So that it looks as if, having once got into a medical train of thought from the subject he was writing about, medical language naturally came uppermost in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">Have swollen</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, only here in the Bible, and not found in this sense in older classical writers. But it is the usual medical word for "inflammation" in any part of the body. <span class="cmt_word">Fallen down</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a>, and twice in the LXX.; but common in Homer and elsewhere, and especially frequent in medical writers of persons falling down in fits, or weakness, or wounded, or the like. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing amiss</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Mr. Hobart quotes a remarkable parallel to this phrase from Damocrites, quoted by Galen. He says that whosoever, having been bitten by a mad dog, drinks a certain antidote (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fb3;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), "shall suffer no harm." It is used in medical writers in two senses - of" unusual symptoms," and of fatal consequences. In the New Testament it only occurs elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-41.htm">Luke 23:41</a>, "Nothing amiss;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. It is also used in the LXX. for wickedness, doing wickedly, etc. <span class="cmt_word">They changed their minds</span>; as in an opposite direction the Lycaonians did (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11, 19</a>). It is a graphic picture of the fickleness of an untutored mind yielding to every impulse. The impunity with which St. Paul endured the bite of the viper was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a> (see further note on ver. 8). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 God can make strangers to be friends; friends in distress. Those who are despised for homely manners, are often more friendly than the more polished; and the conduct of heathens, or persons called barbarians, condemns many in civilized nations, professing to be Christians. The people thought that Paul was a murderer, and that the viper was sent by Divine justice, to be the avenger of blood. They knew that there is a God who governs the world, so that things do not come to pass by chance, no, not the smallest event, but all by Divine direction; and that evil pursues sinners; that there are good works which God will reward, and wicked works which he will punish. Also, that murder is a dreadful crime, one which shall not long go unpunished. But they thought all wicked people were punished in this life. Though some are made examples in this world, to prove that there is a God and a Providence, yet many are left unpunished, to prove that there is a judgment to come. They also thought all who were remarkably afflicted in this life were wicked people. Divine revelation sets this matter in a true light. Good men often are greatly afflicted in this life, for the trial and increase of their faith and patience. Observe Paul's deliverance from the danger. And thus in the strength of the grace of Christ, believers shake off the temptations of Satan, with holy resolution. When we despise the censures and reproaches of men, and look upon them with holy contempt, having the testimony of our consciences for us, then, like Paul, we shake off the viper into the fire. It does us no harm, except we are kept by it from our duty. God hereby made Paul remarkable among these people, and so made way for the receiving of the gospel. The Lord raises up friends for his people in every place whither he leads them, and makes them blessings to those in affliction.</body></html>
