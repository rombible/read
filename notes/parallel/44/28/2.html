It is obvious, however, that St. Luke uses the term, as St. Paul does (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm" title="I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.">Romans 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-11.htm" title="Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.">1Corinthians 14:11</a>), and as was then common, as applicable to all races that did not speak Greek, and that such a term as "Scythian" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>) was used to describe what we should call "barbarians" or "savages." For him "barbarian" was like the term "native," which our travellers apply indiscriminately to Fiji Islanders and Cingalese. The language of Malta at the time, if not absolutely Punic, was probably a very bastard Greek. The inscriptions which have been found in the island are, as was natural, in the Greek and Latin, which were used as official languages by their rulers.<p><span class= "bld">No little kindness.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">no common</span> (or <span class= "ital">average</span>)<span class= "ital"> philanthropy.</span> The idiom is the same as that of the "special miracles" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-11.htm" title="And God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul:">Acts 19:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And received us . . .</span>--The word implies both shelter and hospitality.

The plight of the shipwrecked party must have been lamentable, drenched to the skin, with no change of clothes, a cold wind blowing. Probably the hearty meal they had taken on beard ship was the means of saving their lives. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 God can make strangers to be friends; friends in distress. Those who are despised for homely manners, are often more friendly than the more polished; and the conduct of heathens, or persons called barbarians, condemns many in civilized nations, professing to be Christians. The people thought that Paul was a murderer, and that the viper was sent by Divine justice, to be the avenger of blood. They knew that there is a God who governs the world, so that things do not come to pass by chance, no, not the smallest event, but all by Divine direction; and that evil pursues sinners; that there are good works which God will reward, and wicked works which he will punish. Also, that murder is a dreadful crime, one which shall not long go unpunished. But they thought all wicked people were punished in this life. Though some are made examples in this world, to prove that there is a God and a Providence, yet many are left unpunished, to prove that there is a judgment to come. They also thought all who were remarkably afflicted in this life were wicked people. Divine revelation sets this matter in a true light. Good men often are greatly afflicted in this life, for the trial and increase of their faith and patience. Observe Paul's deliverance from the danger. And thus in the strength of the grace of Christ, believers shake off the temptations of Satan, with holy resolution. When we despise the censures and reproaches of men, and look upon them with holy contempt, having the testimony of our consciences for us, then, like Paul, we shake off the viper into the fire. It does us no harm, except we are kept by it from our duty. God hereby made Paul remarkable among these people, and so made way for the receiving of the gospel. The Lord raises up friends for his people in every place whither he leads them, and makes them blessings to those in affliction.</body></html>
