From that point, as they neared the city, the Appian Road would present more of its characteristic features--the tall milestones, the stately tombs, of which that to Caecilia Metella, the wife of Crassus, is the most representative example, and which, lining either side, gave to the road the appearance of one long cemetery, and bore their record of the fame or the vanity, the wealth or the virtues, of the dead. As they drew nearer still, St. Paul's companions would point out to him the Grove and the sacred spring in the valley of Egeria, now let to a. colony of squatters of his own race.<p>"Hic ubi nocturnae Numa constituebat amicae,<p>Nunc sacri fontis nemus et delubra locantur<p>Judaeis, quorum cophinus f?numque supellex."<p>["Here, by the sacred scenes of Numa's love,<p>We let on lease the shrines, the stream, the grove,<p>To pauper Jews, who bring their scanty store<p>Of hay and hamper, and who ask no more."]<p>--Juvenal, <span class= "ital">Sat.</span> iii. 12.<p>He would pass the cemetery of the Jews of Rome, lying on the east of the Appian Way, which within the last few years has been discovered and explored, in the <span class= "ital">Vigna Randanini, </span>and the <span class= "ital">Columbaria</span> (now in the <span class= "ital">Vigna Codini</span>) of the imperial household, with which, as themselves of the <span class= "ital">libertini</span> class, many of his friends and disciples were even then so closely connected. He would see, perhaps, even then, the beginning of the Catacombs, where the Christians, who would not burn their dead like the heathen, and who were excluded from the cemetery of the Jews, laid their dead to sleep in peace, in what was afterwards the Catacomb of St. Callistus. It may be noted here that the earliest inscription on any Jewish burial-place in Italy is one found at Naples, of the time of Claudius (A.D. 44) (Garucci, <span class= "ital">Cimitero degli antichi Ebrei, </span>p. 24; Mommsen, <span class= "ital">Inscriptt. Neap. Lat.</span> 6467), and the earliest Christian inscription with any note of time, of that of Vespasian (De Rossi, <span class= "ital">Inscriptt. Christ.</span> No. 1). It lies in the nature of the case, however, that at first both Jews and Christians were likely to bury their dead without any formal record, and had to wait for quieter times before they could indulge in the luxury of tombstones and epitaphs. Continuing his journey, the Apostle and his companions would come within view of the pyramid of Caius Cestius, would pass under the Arch of Drusus, which still stands outside the Porta di S. Sebastiano, and enter the city by the Porta Capena, or Capuan Gate, proceeding thence to the Palace of the Caesars, which stood on the Palatine Hill, and looked down, on one side upon the Forum, on the other upon the Circus Maximus.<p><span class= "bld">Paul was suffered to dwell by himself.</span>--The centurion, on arriving at the Palace of the Caesars, would naturally deliver his prisoners to the captain of the division of the Praetorian Guard stationed there as the emperor's body-guard. The favour shown to St. Paul may fairly be considered as due to the influence of the centurion Julius, from whom he had, from the first, received so many marks of courtesy. The Prefect of the Praetorium was the natural custodian of prisoners sent from the provinces, and about this time that office was filled by Burrus, the friend and colleague of Seneca. Before and after his time there were two prefects, and the way in which St. Luke speaks of "<span class= "ital">the </span>captain of the guard" may fairly be accepted as a note of time fixing the date of the Apostle's arrival. The Praetorian camp lay to the north-east of the city, outside the Porta Viminalis. The manner in which St. Luke speaks of his "dwelling by himself" implies that he went at once, instead of accepting the hospitality of any friends, into a hired apartment. Tradition points to the vestibule of, the Church of Santa Maria, at the junction of the Via Lata and the Corso, as the site of his dwelling; but it has been urged by Dr. Philip, at present working as a missionary in the Ghetto at Rome, in a pamphlet, <span class= "ital">On the Ghetto </span>(Rome, 1874), that this site, forming part of the old Flaminian Way, was then occupied by arches and public buildings, and that it was far more probable that he would fix his quarters near those of own countrymen. He adds that a local tradition points to No. 2 in the Via Stringhari, just outside the modern Ghetto, as having been St. Paul's dwelling-place, but does not give any documentary evidence as to its nature or the date to which it can be traced back.<p><span class= "bld">With a soldier that kept him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">with the soldier. </span>The arrangement was technically known as a <span class= "ital">custodia libera. </span>The prisoner, however, was fastened by a chain to the soldier who kept guard over him, and so the Apostle speaks of his "chain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>), of his being a "prisoner" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>), an ambassador in <span class= "ital">chains </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>), of his "bonds" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Philippians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Philippians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-17.htm" title="But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.">Philippians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm" title=" The salutation by the hand of me Paul.

It was almost a matter of course that the guard would from time to time be relieved, and so the Apostle's bonds, and the story of his sufferings, and what had brought them on him, would be known throughout the whole Praetorian camp from which the soldiers came.

There were usually two great officers so called, and it was their special duty to take charge of prisoners sent from the provinces to be tried at Rome. 'Vinctus mitti ad praefectos praetorii met debet" (Pliny, 'Epist.,' 10:65). It has been argued, from the mention of "the captain of the guard," that Paul's imprisonment must have occurred when Burrus was sole prefect, as related by Tacitus ('Annal.,' 12:42, 1), and that hence we get a precise date for it (so Wieseler, 'Chronologic de Apostolisch. Geshichte'). But this can hardly be depended upon. Luke might speak of "the prefect," meaning the one to whom the prisoners were actually committed, just as we might speak of a magistrate writing to "the secretary of state," or an ambassador calling upon "the secretary of state," the matter in hand determining which of the three secretaries we meant. <span class="cmt_word">With the soldier that guarded him</span>. It appears from ver. 20 that St. Paul was subjected to the <span class="accented">custodia militaris, i.e.</span> that he was fastened by a single chain to a praetorian (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), but, as a special favor, granted probably on the good report of the courteous Julius, was allowed to dwell in his own hired house (ver. 30); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-23.htm">Acts 24:23</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:11-16 The common events of travelling are seldom worthy of being told; but the comfort of communion with the saints, and kindness shown by friends, deserve particular mention. The Christians at Rome were so far from being ashamed of Paul, or afraid of owning him, because he was a prisoner, that they were the more careful to show him respect. He had great comfort in this. And if our friends are kind to us, God puts it into their hearts, and we must give him the glory. When we see those even in strange places, who bear Christ's name, fear God, and serve him, we should lift up our hearts to heaven in thanksgiving. How many great men have made their entry into Rome, crowned and in triumph, who really were plagues to the world! But here a good man makes his entry into Rome, chained as a poor captive, who was a greater blessing to the world than any other merely a man. Is not this enough to put us for ever out of conceit with worldly favour? This may encourage God's prisoners, that he can give them favour in the eyes of those that carry them captives. When God does not soon deliver his people out of bondage, yet makes it easy to them, or them easy under it, they have reason to be thankful.</body></html>
