Those who are described as the "chief" would naturally include the ruler of the synagogue (the title <span class= "ital">Archisynagogus </span>is found in a Jewish inscription from Capua, now in the Lateran Museum); the <span class= "ital">Archontes, </span>or rulers of the people--perhaps another way of describing the Archisynagogi--(this title is found in the Jewish cemetery at Rome already mentioned; Garucci, <span class= "ital">ut supra, p. </span>35); the Scribes (the title <span class= "ital">Grammateus </span>is also found, pp. 42, 47, 55, 59); the <span class= "ital">Gerousiarchai, </span>or heads of the Jewish senate, which was allowed, as at Alexandria, a certain measure of independent jurisdiction (pp. 51, 62); the "fathers of the synagogue," perhaps identical with the "rulers" or "elders," perhaps of a slightly higher grade (p. 52); perhaps, also (for this title also is found), the "mothers of the synagogue," occupying, possibly, a position more or less analogous to the widows and deaconesses of the Christian Church (pp. 52, 53);<span class= "note">[4]</span> those who were known as <span class= "ital">Nomomatheis</span>, or students of the Law (p. 57); the wealthier traders; those who, as freed-men, held office of some kind in the imperial court, or, like the Aliturius mentioned by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Life, </span>c. 3), courted the favour of Poppaea, and gained the praise of Nero by acting in his spectacles. To such a mingled crowd, summoned by a special messenger--or, it may be, by a notice read on the Sabbath in the synagogue, or posted on some wall or pillar in the Jewish quarter--after three days spent, partly in settling in his lodging, partly in the delivery of the summons, St. Paul now addressed himself. These he was seeking to win, if possible, for Christ.<p><span class= "note">[4] Since I wrote the above, I have heard from Dr. A. Edersheim, than whom there is no higher living authority on matters connected with Jewish archaeology, that in his judgment the title of "father" or "mother" of the synagogue did not imply any functions, but was assigned as a mark of honour to its oldest members. He rests this belief on the fact that they are found chiefly, or exclusively, in inscriptions which record a very advanced as 80 or 110.<p>(</span>17<span class= "note">)</span> <span class= "bld">Though I have committed nothing against the people . . .</span>--We note St. Paul's characteristic tact.

(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-28.htm" title="For to do whatever your hand and your counsel determined before to be done.">Acts 4:28</a>.) He speaks with respect of their "customs." (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm" title="For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.">Acts 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>.)

In his appeal he sought not to accuse his nation, but only to clear himself. True Christianity settles what is of common concern to all mankind, and is not built upon narrow opinions and private interests. It aims at no worldly benefit or advantage, but all its gains are spiritual and eternal. It is, and always has been, the lot of Christ's holy religion, to be every where spoken against. Look through every town and village where Christ is exalted as the only Saviour of mankind, and where the people are called to follow him in newness of life, and we see those who give themselves up to Christ, still called a sect, a party, and reproached. And this is the treatment they are sure to receive, so long as there shall continue an ungodly man upon earth.</body></html>
