Here we are chiefly concerned with the fact that the words had been cited by our Lord as describing the spiritual state of the Jews of Palestine, and that the record of their citation is found in the first three Gospels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-13.htm" title="Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.">Matthew 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-12.htm" title="That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.">Mark 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm" title="And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.">Luke 8:10</a>), while St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-40.htm" title="He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.">John 12:40</a>) reproduces them as embodying the solution of the apparent failure of our Lord's personal ministry. Looking to the fact that this implies a wide currency given to the prophecy in all reports, oral or written, of our Lord's teaching, and that St. Paul was clearly well acquainted with one collection of our Lord's discourses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>), we can hardly resist the inference that he now applied them as following in the track of his Master's teaching. What was true of the Jews of Jerusalem was true also of those of Rome. In both there was a wilful blindness and deafness to that which ought to have produced conviction and conversion. (Comp. the language which the Apostle had previously used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - Go <span class="accented">thou</span> for go, A.V.; <span class="accented">by hearing</span> for <span class="accented">hearing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in no wise</span> for <span class="accented">not</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">shall in no wise</span> for <span class="accented">not</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Go thou</span>, etc. The quotation is all but <span class="accented">verbatim</span> from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a>. This particular chapter was evidently deemed one of great importance, since our Lord quotes from it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14, 15</a>), and St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-41</a>), as well as St. Paul in the passage before us. <span class="cmt_word">By hearing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span>). Why the LXX. translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span> by the substantive (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span>) instead of by the participle (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), as in the precisely similar phrase which follows - <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> - does not appear. The Hebrew reads, as it is rendered in the A.V.," Hear ye,... and see ye," etc., in the imperative mood, not differing much in sense (in prophetical language) from the future. It is impossible to give the force in English exactly of the repetition of the verb in the infinitive mood <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;</span> by a very common Hebrew idiom. It is done imperfectly by the word "indeed." Rosenmuller quotes from Demosthenes ('Contr. Aristogit.,' 1.) the proverbial saying, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:23-31 Paul persuaded the Jews concerning Jesus. Some were wrought upon by the word, and others hardened; some received the light, and others shut their eyes against it. And the same has always been the effect of the gospel. Paul parted with them, observing that the Holy Ghost had well described their state. Let all that hear the gospel, and do not heed it, tremble at their doom; for who shall heal them, if God does not? The Jews had afterwards much reasoning among themselves. Many have great reasoning, who do not reason aright. They find fault with one another's opinions, yet will not yield to truth. Nor will men's reasoning among themselves convince them, without the grace of God to open their understandings. While we mourn on account of such despisers, we should rejoice that the salvation of God is sent to others, who will receive it; and if we are of that number, we should be thankful to Him who hath made us to differ. The apostle kept to his principle, to know and preach nothing but Christ and him crucified. Christians, when tempted from their main business, should bring themselves back with this question, What does this concern the Lord Jesus? What tendency has it to bring us to him, and to keep us walking in him? The apostle preached not himself, but Christ, and he was not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Though Paul was placed in a very narrow opportunity for being useful, he was not disturbed in it. Though it was not a wide door that was opened to him, yet no man was suffered to shut it; and to many it was an effectual door, so that there were saints even in Nero's household, Php 4:22. We learn also from Php 1:13, how God overruled Paul's imprisonment for the furtherance of the gospel. And not the residents at Rome only, but all the church of Christ, to the present day, and in the most remote corner of the globe, have abundant reason to bless God, that during the most mature period of his Christian life and experience, he was detained a prisoner. It was from his prison, probably chained hand to hand to the soldier who kept him, that the apostle wrote the epistles to the Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews; epistles showing, perhaps more than any others, the Christian love with which his heart overflowed, and the Christian experience with which his soul was filled. The believer of the present time may have less of triumph, and less of heavenly joy, than the apostle, but every follower of the same Saviour, is equally sure of safety and peace at the last. Let us seek to live more and more in the love of the Saviour; to labour to glorify Him by every action of our lives; and we shall assuredly, by his strength, be among the number of those who now overcome our enemies; and by his free grace and mercy, be hereafter among the blessed company who shall sit with Him upon his throne, even as He also has overcome, and is sitting on his Father's throne, at God's right hand for evermore.</body></html>
