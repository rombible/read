Ships bound from Alexandria to Italy commonly put in there. The stay of three days was probably caused by their waiting for a favourable wind. The fact stated in the next verse implies that it was more or less against them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- Touching</span> for <span class="accented">landing</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Touching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-3.htm">Acts 21:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-3.htm">Acts 27:3</a>, note.

"Syracause is about eighty miles, a days' sail, from Malta" (Afford). <span class="cmt_word">Tarried there three days</span>. Perhaps wind- bound, or possibly having to land part of their cargo there. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:11-16 The common events of travelling are seldom worthy of being told; but the comfort of communion with the saints, and kindness shown by friends, deserve particular mention. The Christians at Rome were so far from being ashamed of Paul, or afraid of owning him, because he was a prisoner, that they were the more careful to show him respect. He had great comfort in this. And if our friends are kind to us, God puts it into their hearts, and we must give him the glory. When we see those even in strange places, who bear Christ's name, fear God, and serve him, we should lift up our hearts to heaven in thanksgiving. How many great men have made their entry into Rome, crowned and in triumph, who really were plagues to the world! But here a good man makes his entry into Rome, chained as a poor captive, who was a greater blessing to the world than any other merely a man. Is not this enough to put us for ever out of conceit with worldly favour? This may encourage God's prisoners, that he can give them favour in the eyes of those that carry them captives. When God does not soon deliver his people out of bondage, yet makes it easy to them, or them easy under it, they have reason to be thankful.</body></html>
