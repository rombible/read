The Greek word, however, is applied to the dry stalks of herbaceous plants rather than to the branches of trees, and, as such, exactly describes the stout, thorny heather that still grows near the bay. It is clear, however, apart from this, that the people of Malta did not live without fire, and, not having coal, must therefore have had wood of some kind as fuel.<p><span class= "bld">There came</span> <span class= "bld">a viper out of the heat.</span>--There are said to be no venomous serpents now in Malta, and this again has been pressed into the question of the identity of the island. Mr. Lewin, however (<span class= "ital">St. Paul, </span>ii. 208), states that he saw a serpent, near St. Paul's Bay, that looked very like a viper; and even if he were mistaken in this, it would be natural enough that venomous snakes should disappear under the influence of culture, as they have done elsewhere, in the course of 1800 years.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; a <span class="accented">viper came</span> for <span class="accented">there came a viper</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">by reason of</span> for <span class="accented">out of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Had gathered</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, only here and in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a> and Judges 12:4, for "to collect," "gather together."

In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "to twist up together," to "form into a compact body," and the like. <span class="cmt_word">A bundle of sticks</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The word only occurs in the New Testament here; it means "dry sticks," "kindlers," any combustible material. In the LXX. it is used as the equi- valent of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, straw or stubble (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, etc.), and for "nettles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a>). Theophrastus seems to use it for plants smaller than a shrub ('Hist.,' Plant., 1:3, 1, quoted by Hobart). Lewin (vol. it. p. 208) writes as follows: - "When in Malta in 1853, I went to St. Paul's Bay at the same season of the year as when the wreck occurred .... We noticed eight or nine stacks of small faggots, they consisted of a kind of thorny heather, and had evidently been cut for firewood." This is a conclusive answer, if any were needed, to the objection to Melita being Malta, drawn from the absence of wood in the island. But besides this, it is not a fact that even now there is no wood at all (see Lewin). <span class="cmt_word">A viper came out</span>. It is objected that there are no vipers in Malta. But it is obvious that the condition of Malta now, a very thickly inhabited island (one thousand two hundred people to the square mile, Lewin, p. 208), is very different from what it was with a sparse population in the days of St. Paul. Vipers may well have been destroyed during one thousand eight hundred and sixty years. Lewin mentions that his traveling companions in 1853 started what they thought was a viper, which escaped into one of the bundles of heather. <span class="accented">Came out.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> is the reading of Tischendorf, Alford, Meyer, eta., "came out through the sticks." It is a frequent medical term. <span class="cmt_word">The heat</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>.

It occurs, however, repeatedly in the LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-17.htm">Job 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>; Ecclus. 38:34, etc.), and was the usual medical word for feverish heat. <span class="cmt_word">Fastened</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span>, here only in the Bible; but not uncommon in classical Greek, and of general use among medical writers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 God can make strangers to be friends; friends in distress. Those who are despised for homely manners, are often more friendly than the more polished; and the conduct of heathens, or persons called barbarians, condemns many in civilized nations, professing to be Christians. The people thought that Paul was a murderer, and that the viper was sent by Divine justice, to be the avenger of blood. They knew that there is a God who governs the world, so that things do not come to pass by chance, no, not the smallest event, but all by Divine direction; and that evil pursues sinners; that there are good works which God will reward, and wicked works which he will punish. Also, that murder is a dreadful crime, one which shall not long go unpunished. But they thought all wicked people were punished in this life. Though some are made examples in this world, to prove that there is a God and a Providence, yet many are left unpunished, to prove that there is a judgment to come. They also thought all who were remarkably afflicted in this life were wicked people. Divine revelation sets this matter in a true light. Good men often are greatly afflicted in this life, for the trial and increase of their faith and patience. Observe Paul's deliverance from the danger. And thus in the strength of the grace of Christ, believers shake off the temptations of Satan, with holy resolution. When we despise the censures and reproaches of men, and look upon them with holy contempt, having the testimony of our consciences for us, then, like Paul, we shake off the viper into the fire. It does us no harm, except we are kept by it from our duty. God hereby made Paul remarkable among these people, and so made way for the receiving of the gospel. The Lord raises up friends for his people in every place whither he leads them, and makes them blessings to those in affliction.</body></html>
