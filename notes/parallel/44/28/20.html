There is a certain touch of pathos in this appeal to his sufferings as a prisoner. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a><span class= "ital">.</span>) The hope for which he suffered was two-fold: (1) the expectation of the Messiah as bringing in a kingdom of heaven, which was cherished by every Israelite; (2) the hope of a resurrection from the dead, which he proclaimed as attested by <span class= "ital">the</span> resurrection which proved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3-4</a>) that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/26-6.htm" title="And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, to our fathers:">Acts 26:6-7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="accented">Did</span> <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">entreat you to see and to speak with me</span> for <span class="accented">have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you</span>, A.V.; for <span class="accented">because of</span> for <span class="accented">because that for</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To see and to speak with me</span>. Meyer, followed by Alford, rightly prefers the rendering of the A.V. and the margin of the R.V. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is here in its primary sense of calling any one to come to you, and the two infinitives express the object for which he called them, viz. to see and speak with them. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the hope of Israel</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14, 15, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-6.htm">Acts 26:6, 22, 23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am bound with this chain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-42.htm">Mark 9:42</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-2.htm">Luke 17:2</a> the millstone 'hangs about' (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the neck. But here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-2.htm">Hebrews 5:2</a> the construction is different, and the subject and the object are reversed. Instead of the chain encompassing Paul, Paul is said to be bound with the chain. (For the <span class="accented">chain</span>, see ver. 16, note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-23.htm">Acts 24:23</a>.) The force of this saying seems to be this, "I have asked you to come to me because this chain which binds me is not a token of a renegade Israelite who has come to Rome to accuse his nation before the heathen master, but of a faithful Israelite, who has endured bondage rather than forsake the hope of his fathers." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:17-22 It was for the honour of Paul that those who examined his case, acquitted him. In his appeal he sought not to accuse his nation, but only to clear himself. True Christianity settles what is of common concern to all mankind, and is not built upon narrow opinions and private interests. It aims at no worldly benefit or advantage, but all its gains are spiritual and eternal. It is, and always has been, the lot of Christ's holy religion, to be every where spoken against. Look through every town and village where Christ is exalted as the only Saviour of mankind, and where the people are called to follow him in newness of life, and we see those who give themselves up to Christ, still called a sect, a party, and reproached. And this is the treatment they are sure to receive, so long as there shall continue an ungodly man upon earth.</body></html>
