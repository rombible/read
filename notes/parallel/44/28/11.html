The Fast, falling on the 10th of Tisri, which has been calculated as falling in that year on September 24th, was passed, we are not told how long, when the ship left the Fair Havens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>). Then came the "fourteen days" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-27.htm" title="But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;">Acts 27:27</a>, bringing us to the end of October or beginning of November. Three months from this carries us to the beginning of February. This was earlier than that usually fixed for the general navigation of the Mediterranean (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>), but the officers and the crew of the Alexandrian ship were naturally anxious to take the earliest opportunity for pressing on to their destination. The fact that the latter had wintered in the island is obviously in favour of the identification of Melita with Malta, which lay on the usual line of the voyage from Alexandria to Italy, while Meleda was altogether out of the way.<p><span class= "bld">Whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the Dioscuri, </span>the two sons of Zeus and Leda, who were regarded as the guardian deities of sailors. So Horace (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 3, 2) speaks of the <span class= "ital">"fratres Helen?, lucida sidera</span>" ("brothers of Helen, beaming stars"), and (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 12, 25) of the "<span class= "ital">puerosque Ledce</span>" ("the children of Leda"), whose bright star shines propitiously on sailors. In Greek mythology, Zeus had rewarded their brotherly devotion by placing them among the stars as the <span class= "ital">Gemini, </span>which were connected with the month of May in the signs of the Zodiac, and Poseidon (= Neptune) had given them power over the winds and waves that they might assist the shipwrecked. So in the <span class= "ital">Helena</span> of Euripides they appear, in 1550?60, as promising a fair wind and a safe voyage. The figure-heads of the Greek and Roman ships were commonly placed both at the prow and the stern.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Set sail</span> for <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">island</span> for <span class="accented">isle</span>, A.V.; The <span class="accented">Twin Brothers</span> for <span class="accented">Castor and Pollux</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">After three months</span>. At the very earliest period when the sailing season began after the winter. It would be, perhaps, about the middle of February, or, as Alford thinks, about March 10.

Some ship, better fated than that one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-6.htm">Acts 27:6</a>) which was wrecked in St. Paul's Bay, which had weathered or avoided the gale, and probably got into the harbor of Valetta in good time. One would have thought that this ship wintering at Malta on its way from Alexandria to Italy, via Sicily, would be of itself a sufficient proof that Melita was Malta. <span class="cmt_word">Which had wintered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Whose sign was The Twin Brothers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Latin the constellation <span class="accented">Gemini</span>). The twin sons of Jupiter and Leda, Castor and Pollux, brothers of Helena ("fratres Helenis, lucida sidera," Horace, 'Od.,' 1:3, 2), were called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Dioscuri, the</span> sons of Jove. It was their special office to assist sailors in danger of shipwreck. Hence Horace, in the ode just quoted, prays that Castor and Pollux, in conjunction with other deities, would carry the ship in which Virgil sailed safe to Attica. And in Ode 12:27, etc., he describes the subsidence of the storm, and the calming of the waves, at the appearance of the twin stars, of Leda's sons. It was, therefore, very natural to have the Dioscuri for the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the sign of the ship. Every ancient ship had a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "a painted or carved representation of the <span class="accented">sign</span> which furnished its name on the prow, and at the stern a similar one of their tutelary deity." (Alford), which was called the <span class="accented">tutela.</span> These were sometimes the same, and perhaps were so in this instance. Ovid tells us that Minerva was the <span class="accented">tutela</span> of the ship in which he sailed, and that her painted helmet gave it its name ('Trist.,' 1 9:1), Galea, or the like. We may notice the continual trial to Jews and Christians of having to face idolatry in all the common actions of life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:11-16 The common events of travelling are seldom worthy of being told; but the comfort of communion with the saints, and kindness shown by friends, deserve particular mention. The Christians at Rome were so far from being ashamed of Paul, or afraid of owning him, because he was a prisoner, that they were the more careful to show him respect. He had great comfort in this. And if our friends are kind to us, God puts it into their hearts, and we must give him the glory. When we see those even in strange places, who bear Christ's name, fear God, and serve him, we should lift up our hearts to heaven in thanksgiving. How many great men have made their entry into Rome, crowned and in triumph, who really were plagues to the world! But here a good man makes his entry into Rome, chained as a poor captive, who was a greater blessing to the world than any other merely a man. Is not this enough to put us for ever out of conceit with worldly favour? This may encourage God's prisoners, that he can give them favour in the eyes of those that carry them captives. When God does not soon deliver his people out of bondage, yet makes it easy to them, or them easy under it, they have reason to be thankful.</body></html>
