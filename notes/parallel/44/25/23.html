The fact was the first fulfilment of the promise that the Apostle was to bear His witness before "kings" as well as rulers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>). The Greek word for "pomp" (more literally, <span class= "ital">show</span>) is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. There is an almost tragic pathos in the thought, which must have been present to the mind of the historian, and perhaps, also, to that of others, that this display of the pride of state was exhibited in the very city that had witnessed the terrible chastisement of a like display in his father. The vice was inherited: the lesson had not been learnt.<p><span class= "bld">The chief captains.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">chiliarchs, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-31.htm" title="And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.">Acts 21:31</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- So</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">they were</span> for <span class="accented">was</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the principal</span> for <span class="accented">principal</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the command of Festus</span> for <span class="accented">Festus</span> <span class="accented">commandment</span>, A.V.;<span class="accented">brought in</span> for <span class="accented">brought forth</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">With great pomp</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, here only in the New Testament.

Military tribunes, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-31.htm">Acts 21:31</a>, and very frequently in the Acts. Meyer notes that, as there were five cohorts garrisoned in Caesarea, there would be five chiliarchs, or tribunes. <span class="cmt_word">At the command of Festus</span>. These minute touches suggest that St. Luke was most likely in the hall, and saw the "<span class="accented">great</span> pomp," and heard Festus give the order lot Paul to be brought. Brought in (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); see ver. 6, note. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:13-27 Agrippa had the government of Galilee. How many unjust and hasty judgments the Roman maxim, ver. 16, condemn! This heathen, guided only by the light of nature, followed law and custom exactly, yet how many Christians will not follow the rules of truth, justice, and charity, in judging their brethren! The questions about God's worship, the way of salvation, and the truths of the gospel, may appear doubtful and without interest, to worldly men and mere politicians. See how slightly this Roman speaks of Christ, and of the great controversy between the Jews and the Christians. But the day is at hand when Festus and the whole world will see, that all the concerns of the Roman empire were but trifles and of no consequence, compared with this question of Christ's resurrection. Those who have had means of instruction, and have despised them, will be awfully convinced of their sin and folly. Here was a noble assembly brought together to hear the truths of the gospel, though they only meant to gratify their curiosity by attending to the defence of a prisoner. Many, even now, attend at the places of hearing the word of God with great pomp, and too often with no better motive than curiosity. And though ministers do not now stand as prisoners to make a defence for their lives, yet numbers affect to sit in judgment upon them, desirous to make them offenders for a word, rather than to learn from them the truth and will of God, for the salvation of their souls But the pomp of this appearance was outshone by the real glory of the poor prisoner at the bar. What was the honour of their fine appearance, compared with that of Paul's wisdom, and grace, and holiness; his courage and constancy in suffering for Christ! It is no small mercy to have God clear up our righteousness as the light, and our just dealing as the noon-day; to have nothing certain laid to our charge. And God makes even the enemies of his people to do them right.</body></html>
