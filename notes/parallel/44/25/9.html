The invitation was in itself plausible enough. It practically admitted that there was no evidence on the last head of the accusation of which he, as procurator, need take cognizance. It offered the prisoner a trial before his own national tribunal, with the presence of the procurator as a check upon violence and injustice. It is manifest from St. Paul's answer that this was practically what Festus meant. The proposed trial would, he says, not be before Caesar's judgment seat, and he, for his part, preferred the secular to the ecclesiastical tribunal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Desiring to gain</span> favor <span class="accented">with the Jews</span> for <span class="accented">willing to do the Jews a pleasure</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To gain favor</span>, etc. (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-27.htm">Acts 24:27</a>, note). It was not unnatural that Festus, ignorant as he still was of Jewish malice and bigotry and violence, in the case of Paul, and anxious to conciliate a people so difficult to govern as the Jews had showed themselves to be, should make the proposal. In doing so he still insisted that the trial should be before him. <span class="cmt_word">Before me</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-30.htm">Acts 23:30</a> and Acts 26:2; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> "before thee," viz. King Agrippa in the last case, and Felix in the former. The expression is somewhat ambiguous, and may merely mean that Festus would be present in the court to ensure fair play, while the Sanhedrim judged Paul according to their Law, and so Paul seems, by his answer, to have understood it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-12 See how restless malice is. Persecutors deem it a peculiar favour to have their malice gratified. Preaching Christ, the end of the law, was no offence against the law. In suffering times the prudence of the Lord's people is tried, as well as their patience; they need wisdom. It becomes those who are innocent, to insist upon their innocence. Paul was willing to abide by the rules of the law, and to let that take its course. If he deserved death, he would accept the punishment. But if none of the things whereof they accused him were true, no man could deliver him unto them, with justice. Paul is neither released nor condemned. It is an instance of the slow steps which Providence takes; by which we are often made ashamed, both of our hopes and of our fears, and are kept waiting on God.</body></html>
