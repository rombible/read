The first of the emperors had rejected it as an "accursed and ill-omened title," and had not allowed it to be used even by his children or grand-children, either seriously or in play. The name "Augustus," with its religious associations, was enough for him.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> <span class="accented">- King</span> for O <span class="accented">king</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">may</span> for <span class="accented">might</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>My lord</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>). Suetonius tells us ('Life of Augustus,' 53) that Augustus abhorred the title of "lord," and looked upon it as a curse and an insult when applied to himself. Tiberius also ('Life of Tiberius,' 27), being once called "lord" (<span class="accented">dominus</span>) by some one, indignantly repudiated the title. But it was frequently applied to Trajan by Pithy, and the later emperors seem to have accepted it. It was likely to grow up first in the East. <span class="cmt_word">Examination</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, here only in the New Testament; but it is found in 3Macc. 7:4 in the same sense as here, viz. of a judicial examination (the complaint being that Jews were put to death <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>); specially the <span class="accented">precious examination</span> of the prisoner made for the information of the judge who was to try the case.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, to examine, occurs six times in the Gospel of St. Luke and the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-14.htm">Luke 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-9.htm">Acts 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-19.htm">Acts 12:19</a>, etc.), and ten times in St. Paul's Epistles (see also Hist. of Susanna 48). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:13-27 Agrippa had the government of Galilee. How many unjust and hasty judgments the Roman maxim, ver. 16, condemn! This heathen, guided only by the light of nature, followed law and custom exactly, yet how many Christians will not follow the rules of truth, justice, and charity, in judging their brethren! The questions about God's worship, the way of salvation, and the truths of the gospel, may appear doubtful and without interest, to worldly men and mere politicians. See how slightly this Roman speaks of Christ, and of the great controversy between the Jews and the Christians. But the day is at hand when Festus and the whole world will see, that all the concerns of the Roman empire were but trifles and of no consequence, compared with this question of Christ's resurrection. Those who have had means of instruction, and have despised them, will be awfully convinced of their sin and folly. Here was a noble assembly brought together to hear the truths of the gospel, though they only meant to gratify their curiosity by attending to the defence of a prisoner. Many, even now, attend at the places of hearing the word of God with great pomp, and too often with no better motive than curiosity. And though ministers do not now stand as prisoners to make a defence for their lives, yet numbers affect to sit in judgment upon them, desirous to make them offenders for a word, rather than to learn from them the truth and will of God, for the salvation of their souls But the pomp of this appearance was outshone by the real glory of the poor prisoner at the bar. What was the honour of their fine appearance, compared with that of Paul's wisdom, and grace, and holiness; his courage and constancy in suffering for Christ! It is no small mercy to have God clear up our righteousness as the light, and our just dealing as the noon-day; to have nothing certain laid to our charge. And God makes even the enemies of his people to do them right.</body></html>
