On this supposition Saul would traverse the chief scenes of our Lord's ministry, and be stirred to madness by the progress which the new sect had made in the cities of Samaria. It is, however, possible that he may have taken the road by the Jordan valley by which Galilean pilgrims sometimes travelled in order to avoid Samaria; but the former was beyond all question the most direct and best frequented road.<p><span class= "bld">He came near Damascus.</span>--The city has the interest of being one of the oldest in the world. It appears in the history of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-15.htm" title="And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.">Genesis 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>), and was, traditionally, the scene of the murder of Abel. David placed his garrisons there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm" title="Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">2Samuel 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-6.htm" title="Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">1Chronicles 18:6</a>), and, under Rezon, it resisted the power of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-24.htm" title="And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelled therein, and reigned in Damascus.">1Kings 11:24</a>). Its fair streams, Abana and Pharpar, were, in the eyes of the Syrian leper, better than all the waters of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-12.htm" title="Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.">2Kings 5:12</a>). It was the centre of the Syrian kingdom in its alliances and wars with those of Israel and Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-28.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2Kings 14:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm" title="I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, said the LORD.">Amos 1:5</a>). Its trade with Tyre in wares, and wine of Helbon, and white wool is noted by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-16.htm" title="And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:">Acts 27:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-18.htm" title="And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;">Acts 27:18</a>). It had been taken by Parmenion for Alexander the Great, and again by Pompeius. It was the birth-place of Nicolaos of Damascus, the historian and rhetorician who is conspicuous as the counsellor of Herod the Great (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xii. 3, ? 2; xvi. 2, ? 2). At a later period it was the residence of the Ommiyad caliphs, and the centre of the world of Islam. The beauty of its site, the river which the Greeks knew as Chrysorrhoas, the "Golden Stream," its abounding fertility, the gardens of roses, made it, as Lamartine has said, a "predestined capital." Such was the scene which met the bodily eye of the fanatic persecutor. The historian does not care to dwell on its description, and hastens to that which met his inward gaze. Assuming the journey to have been continuous, the approach to Damascus would come on the seventh or eighth day after leaving Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">There shined round about him a light from heaven.</span>--As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-13.htm" title="At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.">Acts 26:13</a>, "above the brightness of the sun." Three accounts of the event that thus turned the current of the life of Saul of Tarsus meet us in the Acts. (1) This, which gives the writer's report of what he could hardly have heard from any lips but St. Paul's; (2) St. Paul's narrative before the Sanhedrin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/22-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come near to Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.">Acts 22:6-11</a>); (3) that which he gives before Agrippa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/26-13.htm" title="At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.">Acts 26:13-18</a>). They present, as will be seen, considerable variations, such as were natural in the records of a manifestation which was partial to some, and complete to one only. Those that were with him heard a voice but did not distinguish words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-9.htm" title="And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.">Acts 22:9</a>). They saw, as stated here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a>), the light, but did not perceive the form of Him who spoke. The phenomena, in this respect, stand parallel to those of the voice from heaven, in which some heard the words, ascribing them to an angel, while others, hearing only the sound, said it thundered (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-29.htm" title="The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.">John 12:29</a>). It is not possible in such a history to draw a hard and fast line between the objective and the subjective. The man himself cannot say whether he is in the body or out of the body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2Corinthians 12:2-3</a>). It is enough for him that he sees what others do not see, and hears what <span class= "ital">they</span> do not hear, while they too hear and see enough to prove both to themselves and to him that something has occurred beyond the range of ordinary phenomena. Nothing in the narrative suggests the thought of a sudden thunderstorm, which has seemed to some writers a probable explanation of the facts. In that case, the gathering gloom, the dark rolling clouds, would have prepared the traveller for the lightning-flash. If this hypothesis be at all entertained--and as it does not necessarily exclude the supernatural element, and presents analogies to the divine manifestations on Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16</a>) and Horeb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/19-11.htm" title="And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:">1Kings 19:11-12</a>), it may be entertained legitimately--we must think of the storm, if we take such a view, as coming with an almost instantaneous quickness, the first flash and crash striking all with terror, while the full revelation of the Christ was made to the consciousness and conscience of the future Apostle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- It came to pass that he drew nigh unto</span> for <span class="accented">he came near</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">shone</span> for <span class="accented">shined</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">out of for from</span>, A.V. and T.R. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-9 So ill informed was Saul, that he thought he ought to do all he could against the name of Christ, and that he did God service thereby; he seemed to breathe in this as in his element. Let us not despair of renewing grace for the conversion of the greatest sinners, nor let such despair of the pardoning mercy of God for the greatest sin. It is a signal token of Divine favour, if God, by the inward working of his grace, or the outward events of his providence, stops us from prosecuting or executing sinful purposes. Saul saw that Just One, ch. 22:14; 26:13. How near to us is the unseen world! It is but for God to draw aside the veil, and objects are presented to the view, compared with which, whatever is most admired on earth is mean and contemptible. Saul submitted without reserve, desirous to know what the Lord Jesus would have him to do. Christ's discoveries of himself to poor souls are humbling; they lay them very low, in mean thoughts of themselves. For three days Saul took no food, and it pleased God to leave him for that time without relief. His sins were now set in order before him; he was in the dark concerning his own spiritual state, and wounded in spirit for sin. When a sinner is brought to a proper sense of his own state and conduct, he will cast himself wholly on the mercy of the Saviour, asking what he would have him to do. God will direct the humbled sinner, and though he does not often bring transgressors to joy and peace in believing, without sorrows and distress of conscience, under which the soul is deeply engaged as to eternal things, yet happy are those who sow in tears, for they shall reap in joy.</body></html>
