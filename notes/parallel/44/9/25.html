In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-33.htm" title="And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.">2Corinthians 11:33</a> St. Paul describes it by another word (<span class= "ital">sargane</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which gives the idea of a wicker or rope-work hamper. It seems to follow, from the tone in which the Apostle there speaks of this adventure, that it had been made matter of ridicule. It is connected in his thoughts with the "infirmities" (probably with his smallness of stature) of which he was content to boast. The escape was effected, like that of the spies from the house of Rahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-15.htm" title="Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the town wall, and she dwelled on the wall.">Joshua 2:15</a>) and of David from his own house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-11.htm" title="Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, to morrow you shall be slain.">1Samuel 19:11</a>), through an opening or "window" in the town wall. Such a window is still shown in the wall of Damascus as the traditional scene of the escape.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - But for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">his disciples</span> for <span class="accented">the disciples</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">through</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V; <span class="accented">lowering him in</span> for in, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Lowering him</span>, etc. The A.V. gives the sense freely; and combining the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> with the participle <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, translates both by the one word "let him down." The <span class="accented">by</span> of the A.V. seems preferable to the <span class="cmt_word">through</span> of the R.V., as <span class="accented">through</span> suggests the idea, which cannot be intended, of making a hole in the wall. The escape of the spies from Jericho, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>, was exactly in the same way, except that they had only a rope to descend by, whereas St. Paul had a rope-basket. In the description of his escape given by St. Paul to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>), he uses the same word for "let down" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), tells us he was let down "by the wall," R.V. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, with the additional particular that he got out through the window, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and that it was a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, a basket made of ropes (which describes the kind of basket somewhat more accurately than the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> here used) in which he was let down (see note on ver. 20). The passage in 2 Corinthians gives us a further interesting account of how the Jews went about to accomplish their purpose of killing Paul. It seems that at this time, either in revolt against the Romans or by permission of Caligula (it is not known certainly which), a certain Aretas, or Hareth, King of Arabia Petrea, included Damascus in his dominions for a time, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> through the reigns of Caligula and Claudius. He appointed an ethnarch, who was doubtless a Jew, to rule the large Jewish population according to their Law, and who was the ready tool of the unbelieving Jews, using his power as governor to have the gates kept day and night so as to prevent Saul's escape. But he that keepeth Israel neither slumbered nor slept, and by his watchful providence Saul escaped from their hands. As regards the R.Y., his disciples for <span class="accented">the disciples</span>, Alford adopts the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, and holds <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of the R.T. to be simply a mistake for <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, caused by the situation of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. The R.T. cannot be right. "The disciples" is St. Luke's regular expression for "Christians" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1, 2, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10, 19, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-16.htm">Acts 21:16</a>), and is our Lord's name for his followers, but is never used by an apostle of his own followers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-4.htm">1 Corinthians 3:4-7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-31 When we enter into the way of God, we must look for trials; but the Lord knows how to deliver the godly, and will, with the temptation, also make a way to escape. Though Saul's conversion was and is a proof of the truth of Christianity, yet it could not, of itself, convert one soul at enmity with the truth; for nothing can produce true faith, but that power which new-creates the heart. Believers are apt to be too suspicious of those against whom they have prejudices. The world is full of deceit, and it is necessary to be cautious, but we must exercise charity, 1Co 13:5. The Lord will clear up the characters of true believers; and he will bring them to his people, and often gives them opportunities of bearing testimony to his truth, before those who once witnessed their hatred to it. Christ now appeared to Saul, and ordered him to go quickly out of Jerusalem, for he must be sent to the Gentiles: see ch. 22:21. Christ's witnesses cannot be slain till they have finished their testimony. The persecutions were stayed. The professors of the gospel walked uprightly, and enjoyed much comfort from the Holy Ghost, in the hope and peace of the gospel, and others were won over to them. They lived upon the comfort of the Holy Ghost, not only in the days of trouble and affliction, but in days of rest and prosperity. Those are most likely to walk cheerfully, who walk circumspectly.</body></html>
