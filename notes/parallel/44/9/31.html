The tranquility described may have been due, partly to the absence of any leading men among the opponents of the new society; partly, perhaps, to public excitement being diverted to the insane attempt of Caligula to set up his statue in the Temple at Jerusalem--an attempt from which he was only dissuaded by the earnest entreaties of Herod Agrippa, whom he had raised to the dignity of King of Judaea, but who happened at the time to be at Rome, and of Petronius, the <span class= "ital">Pr?ses</span> of Syria. The latter was influenced by great showers of rain falling from a clear sky, after a long drought, in answer to the prayers of Israel (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 8, ? 6). Such prayers, made at a crisis in which believing and unbelieving Jews felt an equal interest, may, probably, have suggested St. James's allusion to the old historical parallel of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">James 5:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Throughout all Judaea and Galilee and</span> Samaria.--Brief as the notice is, it is every way significant. It is the first intimation since the opening of the apostolic history of the existence, not of disciples only, such as had gathered round our Lord during His personal ministry, but of <span class= "ital">organised religious communities, </span>in the towns and villages of Galilee. We may think of such churches as formed in Capernaum and Tiberias, in Chorazin and the two Bethsaidas, perhaps even in Nazareth. The history is silent as to the agency by which these churches had been founded; but looking to the close relations between St. Luke and St. Philip, and to the probability that the latter made Caesarea his head-quarters for the work of an Evangelist, we may legitimately think of him as having worked there as he had worked in Samaria. It is not improbable, however, that here also, as in that region, he may have been followed, after he had done his work as an Evangelist, by the Apostles to whom it belonged to confirm and organise. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-14.htm" title="Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:">Acts 8:14</a>.) The mention of Samaria in like manner indicates the extent and permanence of the result of Philip's work there, followed up as it had been by the preaching of Peter and John.<p><span class= "bld">Were edified; and walking. . . .</span>--The more accurate construction of the sentence gives, <span class= "ital">The Church </span>. . . . <span class= "ital">had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and was multiplied by the counsel of the Holy Ghost.</span> The passage is noticeable for the appearance of the word "edified," or "built up," in the sense in which St. Paul had used it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.

What it describes, as interpreted by its Old Testament use (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-10.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endures for ever.">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.">Proverbs 1:7</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>is the temper of reverential awe; the scrupulous obedience to the commandments of God, which had been described of old as "the beginning" of wisdom.<p><span class= "bld">The comfort of the Holy Ghost.</span>--It was natural that the gift of the Spirit who had been promised as the Paraclete, or Advocate (see <span class= "ital">Excursus G</span> on the Gospel of St. John), should be described by the kindred word of <span class= "ital">paraclesis, </span>and equally natural that this connection should re-appear in the two English words of "comfort" and "Comforter." "Comfort "is, however, somewhat too narrow; the Greek word including (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm" title="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,">Acts 4:36</a>) counsel and exhortation, so as to be very nearly equivalent to "prophecy." What is meant here is that the words of counsel which came from the Holy Ghost, speaking through the prophets of the Church, were, then as always, far more than signs and wonders, or human skill of speech, the chief agents in its expansion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> <span class="accented">- So the Church</span>... <span class="accented">had peace, being edified</span> for <span class="accented">then had the Churches rest</span>,... <span class="accented">and were edified</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">was multiplied</span> for <span class="accented">were multiplied</span>, A.V. and T.R. It is thought that the attention of the Jews to the progress of the faith of Jesus Christ was diverted at this time, and their active hostility stayed, by the still greater danger to the Jews' religion which arose from Caligula's intention of placing a statue to himself as a god in the holy of holies. Thus did God's gracious providence intervene to give rest to his harassed saints, and to build up his Church in numbers, in holiness, and in heavenly comfort. Especially Paul had another breathing-time, which may have been the more required if, as is thought, one at least of the five scourgings mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:24 had been inflicted at Damascus, and one of the three shipwrecks alluded to in the same passage and been undergone in the dangerous coasting voyage from Caesarca to Scleucia. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-31 When we enter into the way of God, we must look for trials; but the Lord knows how to deliver the godly, and will, with the temptation, also make a way to escape. Though Saul's conversion was and is a proof of the truth of Christianity, yet it could not, of itself, convert one soul at enmity with the truth; for nothing can produce true faith, but that power which new-creates the heart. Believers are apt to be too suspicious of those against whom they have prejudices. The world is full of deceit, and it is necessary to be cautious, but we must exercise charity, 1Co 13:5. The Lord will clear up the characters of true believers; and he will bring them to his people, and often gives them opportunities of bearing testimony to his truth, before those who once witnessed their hatred to it. Christ now appeared to Saul, and ordered him to go quickly out of Jerusalem, for he must be sent to the Gentiles: see ch. 22:21. Christ's witnesses cannot be slain till they have finished their testimony. The persecutions were stayed. The professors of the gospel walked uprightly, and enjoyed much comfort from the Holy Ghost, in the hope and peace of the gospel, and others were won over to them. They lived upon the comfort of the Holy Ghost, not only in the days of trouble and affliction, but in days of rest and prosperity. Those are most likely to walk cheerfully, who walk circumspectly.</body></html>
