In the assonance of the Greek words (<span class= "ital">Iesus i?tai se</span>) we may, perhaps, trace a desire to impress the thought that the very name of Jesus testified that He was the great Healer. Such a <span class= "ital">paronomasia</span> has its parallel in the later play upon <span class= "ital">Christiani</span> and <span class= "ital">Chrestiani</span> = the good or gracious people (Tertull. <span class= "ital">Apol. c.</span> 3), perhaps also in St. Peter's own language that the Lord is not <span class= "ital">Christos</span> only, but <span class= "ital">Chrestos</span> = gracious (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>). The command seems to imply a reminiscence of the manner in which our Lord had wrought His work of healing in like cases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.">Matthew 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-8.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.">John 5:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Make thy bed.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">make, </span>or, <span class= "ital">arrange for thyself.</span> He was to do at once for himself what for so many years others had done for him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- Healeth thee</span> for <span class="accented">maketh thee whole</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">straightway he arose</span> for <span class="accented">he arose immediately</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus Christ healeth</span> thee. The juxtaposition, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, looks almost like an intentional play upon the sound. Some of the Fathers who did not know Hebrew derived the name <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and the Anglo-Saxon name for the Savior Haelend, the Healer, seems to have the same origin. <span class="cmt_word">Arise and make thy bed</span>. Not (says Meyer), "Henceforth make thine own bed," but, as the force of the imperative script requires, <span class="accented">maize thy bed now</span>, both as a token of his miraculous cure, and that he might carry it away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-9.htm">Mark 2:9-12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">AEneas</span> is a Greek name, not identical with AEneas (<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), but occurring in Thucydides and elsewhere. If it was a Hebrew name, it might be derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, "(whom) the eye spareth." It is uncertain whether AEneas was a disciple or not. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:32-35 Christians are saints, or holy people; not only the eminent ones, as Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but every sincere professor of the faith of Christ. Christ chose patients whose diseases were incurable in the course of nature, to show how desperate was the case of fallen mankind. When we were wholly without strength, as this poor man, he sent his word to heal us. Peter does not pretend to heal by any power of his own, but directs Eneas to look up to Christ for help. Let none say, that because it is Christ, who, by the power of his grace, works all our works in us, therefore we have no work, no duty to do; for though Jesus Christ makes thee whole, yet thou must arise, and use the power he gives thee.</body></html>
