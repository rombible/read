It was famous in Greek legends as the spot where Andromeda had been bound when she was delivered by Perseus (Strabo, xvi., p. 759; Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, i.</span> 6, ? 2). The town stood on a hill so high that it was said (though this is not in conformity with the fact) that Jerusalem could be seen from its summit. It was the nearest port to that city, and though the harbour was difficult and dangerous of access, was used for the timber that, first under Solomon, and afterwards under Zerubbabel, was brought from Lebanon for the construction of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-9.htm" title="My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and you shall receive them: and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.">1Kings 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-7.htm" title="They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.">Ezra 3:7</a>). In the history of Jonah it appears as a port from which ships sail to Tarshish and Spain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-3.htm" title="But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.">Jonah 1:3</a>). Under the Maccabean rulers the harbour and fortifications were restored (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-5.htm" title="In the mean season came Gorgias by night into the camp of Judas: and when he found no man there, he sought them in the mountains: for said he, These fellows flee from us">1 Maccabees 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-34.htm" title="So they joined battle; and there were slain of the host of Lysias about five thousand men, even before them were they slain.">1 Maccabees 4:34</a>). By Augustus it was given to Herod the Great, and afterwards to Archelaus (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xv.</span> 7, ? 3; xvii. 11, ? 4), and on his deposition, became part of the Roman province of Syria. It was at this time and later on notorious as a nest of pirates. Here also we may, as in the case of Lydda (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-32.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelled at Lydda.">Acts 9:32</a>), see the work of Philip as the probable founder of the Church.<p><span class= "bld">Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas.</span>--Both the Hebrew and Greek names mean <span class= "ital">Antelope</span> or <span class= "ital">Gazelle.</span> The fact that she bore both implies some points of connection both with the Hebrew and Hellenistic sections of the Church. The Greek form occurs, in the curious combination of Juno Dorcas, on one of the inscriptions in the <span class= "ital">Columbarium</span> of Livia, now in the Capitoline Museum at Rome, as belonging to an <span class= "ital">Ornatrix</span> of the Empress. Was the disciple of Joppa in any way connected with the slave, whose very function implied skill in needlework? If, as is probable, the Church at Joppa owed its foundation to Philip (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm" title="But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.">Acts 8:40</a>), we may trace in the position which she occupied, in relation to the "widows" of the Church, something of the same prudential wisdom as had been shown in the appointment of the Seven, of whom he had been one.<p><span class= "bld">Full of good works.</span>--The form of the expression may be noticed as characteristic of St. Luke, and his favourite formula for conveying the thought of a quality being possessed in the highest degree possible. So we have "full of leprosy" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-12.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and sought him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Luke 5:12</a>, "full of grace" and "full of faith" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-8.htm" title="And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.">Acts 6:8</a>. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-28.htm" title="And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.">Acts 19:28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joppa</span>; now Jaffa, the ancient seaport of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>). It was in the tribe of Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A certain disciple</span>; a female disciple, as the word means; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> only occurs here in the New Testament and rarely elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">Tabitha</span>; the Aramean form of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, a gazelle, or in Greek Dorcas. The beauty and grace of the gazelle made it an appropriate name for a woman. Some have thought, with probability, that she was a deaconess of the Church. The thirty-eighth verse shows that there was already a Church at Joppa About half the population of seven thousand are said to be still Christians. Compare the qualifications of a widow as set forth by St Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The phrase, good works</span>, is quite Pauline (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm">1 Timothy 2:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Almsdeeds</span>. The word <span class="accented">alms</span> (from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) is one of those Greek words which has been domiciled in the English language through the Church. So <span class="accented">bishop, priest, deacon</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">trisagion, stole, Paschal, Litany, Liturgy</span>, and many others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:36-43 Many are full of good words, who are empty and barren in good works; but Tabitha was a great doer, no great talker. Christians who have not property to give in charity, may yet be able to do acts of charity, working with their hands, or walking with their feet, for the good of others. Those are certainly best praised whose own works praise them, whether the words of others do so or not. But such are ungrateful indeed, who have kindness shown them, and will not acknowledge it, by showing the kindness that is done them. While we live upon the fulness of Christ for our whole salvation, we should desire to be full of good works, for the honour of his name, and for the benefit of his saints. Such characters as Dorcas are useful where they dwell, as showing the excellency of the word of truth by their lives. How mean then the cares of the numerous females who seek no distinction but outward decoration, and who waste their lives in the trifling pursuits of dress and vanity! Power went along with the word, and Dorcas came to life. Thus in the raising of dead souls to spiritual life, the first sign of life is the opening of the eyes of the mind. Here we see that the Lord can make up every loss; that he overrules every event for the good of those who trust in him, and for the glory of his name.</body></html>
