The "widows" of the Church were the object of a special provision. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>.) The "coats," were the close-fitting tunics worn next the body, the "garments" the looser outer cloaks that were worn over them. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-40.htm" title="And if any man will sue you at the law, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.">Matthew 5:40</a>.) These were now exhibited by those who were mourning over the loss of their benefactress. It is probable that the garments were for the use of men and boys, as well as women, and that the "widows" had been fellow-workers with her in making them. She was, as it were, at the head of a Sisterhood of Mercy.<p><span class= "bld">Which Dorcas made.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">used to make.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and when</span> for <span class="accented">when</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">All the widows</span>.

But it is quite as probable that <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means the Church widows, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-9.htm">1 Timothy 5:9</a>, and that we have here an indication that the model of the Jerusalem Church was followed in all the daughter Churches. Dorcas's almsdeeds would naturally have for their first object the widows of her own communion. As naturally would they all come to meet the apostle at her house. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:36-43 Many are full of good words, who are empty and barren in good works; but Tabitha was a great doer, no great talker. Christians who have not property to give in charity, may yet be able to do acts of charity, working with their hands, or walking with their feet, for the good of others. Those are certainly best praised whose own works praise them, whether the words of others do so or not. But such are ungrateful indeed, who have kindness shown them, and will not acknowledge it, by showing the kindness that is done them. While we live upon the fulness of Christ for our whole salvation, we should desire to be full of good works, for the honour of his name, and for the benefit of his saints. Such characters as Dorcas are useful where they dwell, as showing the excellency of the word of truth by their lives. How mean then the cares of the numerous females who seek no distinction but outward decoration, and who waste their lives in the trifling pursuits of dress and vanity! Power went along with the word, and Dorcas came to life. Thus in the raising of dead souls to spiritual life, the first sign of life is the opening of the eyes of the mind. Here we see that the Lord can make up every loss; that he overrules every event for the good of those who trust in him, and for the glory of his name.</body></html>
