At Caesarea he would probably, as afterwards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>, find Philip, and the friend and the accuser of the proto-martyr met face to face as brethren. In returning to his home at Tarsus, from which he had been absent at the least for four years, and possibly for a much longer period, it would be natural for him to resume his old employment as a tent-maker. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a>.) Thence, as from a centre, he did his work as an Evangelist in the regions of Cilicia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm" title="Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;">Galatians 1:21</a>), where, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-41.htm" title="And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.">Acts 15:41</a>, we find churches already organised, which had not been founded in what we call the first mission journey of Paul and Barnabas, and must therefore have been planted by the former at an earlier period. Here, for the present, we lose sight of him. It need hardly be said that the Caesarea here spoken of is that on the sea-coast. Caesarea Philippi is always distinguished by its special epithet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="accented">- And when the brethren knew it</span> for <span class="accented">which when the brethren knew</span>, A.V. St. Paul gives another reason for his hasty departure from Jerusalem in his speech from the castle stairs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17-21</a>). Caesarea, when standing alone, means <span class="accented">Caesarea Stratonis</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or Sebaste, the seaport and Roman garrison of that name, as distinguished from Caesarea Philippi (see Alford's note on Acts 8:30), and is always so used by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-40.htm">Luke 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-22.htm">Luke 18:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-8.htm">Luke 21:8, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-23.htm">Luke 23:23, 33</a>; 25:1, 4, 6; 27:1, 2, showing it was a seaport). There is no reasonable doubt that it means the same place here. A seaport, near to Jerusalem, and with Roman protection, affording access to Tarsus either by sea or land as should seem best, was the natural place for Paul's friends to take him to. If further proof were wanting, it could be found in the phrase, "brought him down," as compared with the converse, "gone up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>), "ascended "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1</a>), when the journey was from Caesarea to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">To Tarsus</span>. A glance at the map will show that, starting from Caesarea, a person might either go by land along the sea-coast of Phoenicia, through Acre, Tyre, Sidon, Beyrout, Tripolis, Antioch, Issus, to Tarsus; or by sea to any of the intermediate ports between Caesarea and Tarsus; or rather the artificial harbor at the mouth of the Cydnus which formed the seaport of Tarsus. It is not improbable that Paul landed at Selcucia, since he says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>) that he came at this time "into the regions of Syria and Cilicia," which is exactly what he would have done if he had landed at Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-31 When we enter into the way of God, we must look for trials; but the Lord knows how to deliver the godly, and will, with the temptation, also make a way to escape. Though Saul's conversion was and is a proof of the truth of Christianity, yet it could not, of itself, convert one soul at enmity with the truth; for nothing can produce true faith, but that power which new-creates the heart. Believers are apt to be too suspicious of those against whom they have prejudices. The world is full of deceit, and it is necessary to be cautious, but we must exercise charity, 1Co 13:5. The Lord will clear up the characters of true believers; and he will bring them to his people, and often gives them opportunities of bearing testimony to his truth, before those who once witnessed their hatred to it. Christ now appeared to Saul, and ordered him to go quickly out of Jerusalem, for he must be sent to the Gentiles: see ch. 22:21. Christ's witnesses cannot be slain till they have finished their testimony. The persecutions were stayed. The professors of the gospel walked uprightly, and enjoyed much comfort from the Holy Ghost, in the hope and peace of the gospel, and others were won over to them. They lived upon the comfort of the Holy Ghost, not only in the days of trouble and affliction, but in days of rest and prosperity. Those are most likely to walk cheerfully, who walk circumspectly.</body></html>
