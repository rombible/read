The work was one not to be accomplished by the mere utterance of a name, nor as by his "own power or holiness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm" title="And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?">Acts 3:12</a>), but by the power of the prayer of faith, and this called for the silence and solitude of communion with God. Even the very words which were uttered, if he spoke in Aramaic, must have been, with the change of a single letter, the same as the <span class= "ital">Talitha cumi</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-41.htm" title="And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say to you, arise.">Mark 5:41</a>. The utterance of the words implied the internal assurance that the prayer had been answered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> <span class="accented">- Turning</span> for <span class="accented">turning him</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he said</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V. Peter's action in <span class="cmt_word">putting them all forth</span> seems to have been framed on the model of that scene at which he had been present when Jesus raised the daughter of Jairus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54</a> [T.R.]; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-25.htm">Matthew 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-40.htm">Mark 5:40</a>). Privacy for the more earnest concentrated prayer was doubtless what he sought. <span class="cmt_word">Kneeled down;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>.

It occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-19.htm">Mark 15:19</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Tabitha, arise</span>. Exactly the same address as our Lord's "Talitha cumi" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-40.htm">Mark 5:40</a>), but, as Lange observes, with this difference, that in the case of Peter it was preceded by prayer; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a> (where the Aramean address was probably in the same form); <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:36-43 Many are full of good words, who are empty and barren in good works; but Tabitha was a great doer, no great talker. Christians who have not property to give in charity, may yet be able to do acts of charity, working with their hands, or walking with their feet, for the good of others. Those are certainly best praised whose own works praise them, whether the words of others do so or not. But such are ungrateful indeed, who have kindness shown them, and will not acknowledge it, by showing the kindness that is done them. While we live upon the fulness of Christ for our whole salvation, we should desire to be full of good works, for the honour of his name, and for the benefit of his saints. Such characters as Dorcas are useful where they dwell, as showing the excellency of the word of truth by their lives. How mean then the cares of the numerous females who seek no distinction but outward decoration, and who waste their lives in the trifling pursuits of dress and vanity! Power went along with the word, and Dorcas came to life. Thus in the raising of dead souls to spiritual life, the first sign of life is the opening of the eyes of the mind. Here we see that the Lord can make up every loss; that he overrules every event for the good of those who trust in him, and for the glory of his name.</body></html>
