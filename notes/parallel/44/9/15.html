So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-7.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that your choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.">Isaiah 22:7</a>, we have in the LXX. "valleys of election" for the "choicest valleys" of the English version. The term "vessel" is used in the Old Testament of arms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-3.htm" title="Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;">Genesis 27:3</a>), of garments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm" title="The woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>), of household goods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/31-36.htm" title="And Jacob was wroth, and strived with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?">Genesis 31:36-37</a>). In the New Testament its range of meaning is yet wider, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-29.htm" title="Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.">Matthew 12:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-16.htm" title="No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm" title="Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.">John 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2Corinthians 4:7</a>. Here our word "instrument" or "implement" comes, perhaps, nearest to its meaning. The persecutor had been chosen by the Lord as the "tool" with which He would work out His gracious will for him and for the Gentiles. In this sense it was used by classical writers of useful and trusty slaves, just as we speak of one man being the "tool" of another. Possibly, however, the words may be interpreted as containing the germ of the parable of the potter's vessel on which St. Paul dwells in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-21.htm" title="Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?">Romans 9:21-23</a>, and implied that the convert was not only chosen, but moulded, for his future work. The word "election," which occurs here for the first time in the New Testament, and is afterwards so prominent in the teaching of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm" title="(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)">Romans 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm" title="Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.">Romans 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-7.htm" title="What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.">Romans 11:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1Thessalonians 1:4</a>), affords yet another instance of the influence exercised on the Apostle by the thoughts and language of the instructor through whom alone he could have learnt what is here recorded.<p><span class= "bld">To bear my name before the Gentiles.</span>--The mission of the Apostle was thus revealed to Ananias in the first instance. He is one who welcomes that expansion of the kingdom on which even the chief of the Apostles would have entered, but for the voice from heaven, with doubt and hesitation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-13.htm" title="And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.">Acts 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>). He is taught to see in the man of whom he had only heard as the persecutor, one who had been trained and chosen as fitter than all others for the work of that expansion.<p><span class= "bld">And kings.</span>--The words find their fulfilment in the speech before Agrippa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-12.htm" title="Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,">Acts 26:12</a>); possibly in one before Nero (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2Timothy 1:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A chosen vessel</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm">Galatians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-21.htm">Romans 9:21, 22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bear my name before the Gentiles</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-17.htm">Acts 26:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7-9</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">and kings</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25.htm">Acts 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26.htm">Acts 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16, 17</a>, with reference to Nero), <span class="cmt_word">and the children of Israel</span>. The Gentiles are named before the children of Israel, because St. Paul's special call was to be the apostle of the Gentiles. But we know that even St. Paul's practice was to preach Christ to the Jews first, in every city where there were Jews. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:10-22 A good work was begun in Saul, when he was brought to Christ's feet with those words, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And never did Christ leave any who were brought to that. Behold, the proud Pharisee, the unmerciful oppressor, the daring blasphemer, prayeth! And thus it is even now, and with the proud infidel, or the abandoned sinner. What happy tidings are these to all who understand the nature and power of prayer, of such prayer as the humbled sinner presents for the blessings of free salvation! Now he began to pray after another manner than he had done; before, he said his prayers, now, he prayed them. Regenerating grace sets people on praying; you may as well find a living man without breath, as a living Christian without prayer. Yet even eminent disciples, like Ananias, sometimes stagger at the commands of the Lord. But it is the Lord's glory to surpass our scanty expectations, and show that those are vessels of his mercy whom we are apt to consider as objects of his vengeance. The teaching of the Holy Spirit takes away the scales of ignorance and pride from the understanding; then the sinner becomes a new creature, and endeavours to recommend the anointed Saviour, the Son of God, to his former companions.</body></html>
