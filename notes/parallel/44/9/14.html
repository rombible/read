The description of the disciples of the Lord Jesus as those who called upon or invoked His name, had its origin in the words of Joel cited by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.">Acts 2:21</a>), and afterwards by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-13.htm" title="For whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.">Romans 10:13</a>). It is used again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-21.htm" title="But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came here for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?">Acts 9:21</a>, and afterwards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm" title="Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.">2Timothy 2:22</a>. It may be noted further (1) that the same word is used of calling upon the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-17.htm" title="And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:">1Peter 1:17</a>), and of calling on Christ (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm" title="And they stoned Stephen, calling on God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.">Acts 7:59</a>); and (2) that this also, like the term "saints" discussed in the fore going Note, passed from Ananias to St. Paul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- Upon</span> for <span class="accented">on</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">That call upon thy name</span>. So also ver. 21; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>; and above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>, this same phrase describes the believer who makes his prayer to the Lord Jesus and trusts in his Name for salvation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:10-22 A good work was begun in Saul, when he was brought to Christ's feet with those words, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And never did Christ leave any who were brought to that. Behold, the proud Pharisee, the unmerciful oppressor, the daring blasphemer, prayeth! And thus it is even now, and with the proud infidel, or the abandoned sinner. What happy tidings are these to all who understand the nature and power of prayer, of such prayer as the humbled sinner presents for the blessings of free salvation! Now he began to pray after another manner than he had done; before, he said his prayers, now, he prayed them. Regenerating grace sets people on praying; you may as well find a living man without breath, as a living Christian without prayer. Yet even eminent disciples, like Ananias, sometimes stagger at the commands of the Lord. But it is the Lord's glory to surpass our scanty expectations, and show that those are vessels of his mercy whom we are apt to consider as objects of his vengeance. The teaching of the Holy Spirit takes away the scales of ignorance and pride from the understanding; then the sinner becomes a new creature, and endeavours to recommend the anointed Saviour, the Son of God, to his former companions.</body></html>
