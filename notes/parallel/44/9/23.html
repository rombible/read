That period must have witnessed the growth of a Christian society at Damascus, with an order of discipline and worship based on the outlines of that at Jerusalem. It follows, however, from the subsequent history that, as yet, Gentile converts were not admitted to the Church as such. The special mission to them came later on (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.">Acts 22:21</a>), and it was natural that one, with the intense affection for his brethren according to the flesh which characterised St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-1.htm" title="Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.">Romans 10:1</a>), should, till that mission came, have given himself mainly, or even exclusively, to the work of labouring for their conversion. It is probable, however, from the bitter antagonism of the Jews, that his teaching had already pointed to the breaking down of "the middle wall of partition" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>), and the passing away of all on which they had prided themselves as being their exclusive privileges. From the first it might almost seem as if Stephen had risen from the dead, and was living again in the spirit and power of his persecutor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="accented">When</span> for <span class="accented">after that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">took counsel together</span> for <span class="accented">took counsel</span>, A.V. The phrase <span class="cmt_word">many days</span> is quite elastic enough to comprehend whatever time remained to make up the three years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>) which St. Paul tells us intervened between his conversion and his visit to Jerusalem (see ver. 43; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>; 37:7; 14:3). Luke frequently uses <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> for "many" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-11.htm">Luke 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-27.htm">Luke 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-8.htm">Luke 23:8</a>).

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-38.htm">1 Kings 2:38, 39</a>, it is applied to three years. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:23-31 When we enter into the way of God, we must look for trials; but the Lord knows how to deliver the godly, and will, with the temptation, also make a way to escape. Though Saul's conversion was and is a proof of the truth of Christianity, yet it could not, of itself, convert one soul at enmity with the truth; for nothing can produce true faith, but that power which new-creates the heart. Believers are apt to be too suspicious of those against whom they have prejudices. The world is full of deceit, and it is necessary to be cautious, but we must exercise charity, 1Co 13:5. The Lord will clear up the characters of true believers; and he will bring them to his people, and often gives them opportunities of bearing testimony to his truth, before those who once witnessed their hatred to it. Christ now appeared to Saul, and ordered him to go quickly out of Jerusalem, for he must be sent to the Gentiles: see ch. 22:21. Christ's witnesses cannot be slain till they have finished their testimony. The persecutions were stayed. The professors of the gospel walked uprightly, and enjoyed much comfort from the Holy Ghost, in the hope and peace of the gospel, and others were won over to them. They lived upon the comfort of the Holy Ghost, not only in the days of trouble and affliction, but in days of rest and prosperity. Those are most likely to walk cheerfully, who walk circumspectly.</body></html>
