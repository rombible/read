Somewhat curiously, the house shown by guides as that of Judas is not in it. A piece of ground surrounded by trees, and used as a Christian burial-place, is pointed out as the scene of the Conversion; but this is on the east side of the city, and St. Paul must have approached from the south or south-west.<p><span class= "bld">Saul, of Tarsus.</span>--The passage is memorable as the first mention of the Apostle's birth-place. For an account of the city, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm" title="And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.">Acts 7:58</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm" title="Which when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.">Acts 9:30</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, he prayeth.</span>--The thoughts which the words suggest belong to the preacher rather than the commentator. We can but think of the contrast between the present and the recent past--between the threatening and slaughter which the persecutor breathed out as he drew near to Damascus, and the prayer of humble penitence in which he was now living. Estimating that prayer by that which came as the answer to it, we may think of it as including pardon for the past, light and wisdom for the future, strength to do the work to which he was now called, intercession for those whom he had before persecuted unto the death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- To</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V.<span class="accented">, named</span> for <span class="accented">called</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of Tarsus</span> for <span class="accented">of Tarsus</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The street</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span>, usually the narrower lanes in a town as distinguished from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, or wide streets. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-21.htm">Luke 14:21</a>, "The streets and lanes of the city," and the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-3.htm">Isaiah 15:3</a>, couple <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Here, however, the term applies to the principal street of the city, which runs quite straight from the east to the west gate, and is a mile long. It still exists, and is called the Sultany Street; but instead of being the wide and splendid street it was in the apostolic age, a hundred feet wide, with colonnades separating the two footways on the side from the central read, and adorned with a triumphal arch, it is contracted into a narrow mean passage (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 69). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:10-22 A good work was begun in Saul, when he was brought to Christ's feet with those words, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And never did Christ leave any who were brought to that. Behold, the proud Pharisee, the unmerciful oppressor, the daring blasphemer, prayeth! And thus it is even now, and with the proud infidel, or the abandoned sinner. What happy tidings are these to all who understand the nature and power of prayer, of such prayer as the humbled sinner presents for the blessings of free salvation! Now he began to pray after another manner than he had done; before, he said his prayers, now, he prayed them. Regenerating grace sets people on praying; you may as well find a living man without breath, as a living Christian without prayer. Yet even eminent disciples, like Ananias, sometimes stagger at the commands of the Lord. But it is the Lord's glory to surpass our scanty expectations, and show that those are vessels of his mercy whom we are apt to consider as objects of his vengeance. The teaching of the Holy Spirit takes away the scales of ignorance and pride from the understanding; then the sinner becomes a new creature, and endeavours to recommend the anointed Saviour, the Son of God, to his former companions.</body></html>
