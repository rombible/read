Under the grasping rule of Cassius, the inhabitants were sold as slaves (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xiv. 11, ? 2). It had, however, recovered its former prosperity, and appears at this time to have been the seat of a flourishing Christian community. In the wars that preceded the destruction of Jerusalem, it was partially burned by Cestius Gallus A.D. 66 (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 19, ? 1), all but fifty of the inhabitants having gone up to the Feast of Tabernacles at Jerusalem, and was again occupied by Vespasian A.D. 68 (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 8, ? 1). When it was rebuilt, probably under Hadrian, when Jerusalem received the new name of 'lia Capitolina, it also was renamed as Diospolis (= city of Zeus), and as such was the seat of one of the chief bishoprics of the Syrian Church. It was, at the time when Peter came to it, the seat of a Rabbinic school, scarcely inferior to that of Jabneh, and retained its fame after the scribes of the latter city had migrated to Tiberias. Gamaliel, son of the great Rabbi who was St. Paul's master, and himself honoured with the title of Rabban, presided over it, and was succeeded by the great Tarphon (Lightfoot, <span class= "ital">Cent. Chorogr.</span> c. xvi.). The question which we naturally ask, who had planted the faith of Christ there, carries us once more on the track of Philip the Evangelist. Lying as it did on the road from Azotus to Caesarea, it would lie in his way on the journey recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm" title="But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.">Acts 8:40</a>, as he passed "through all the cities;" and we may believe, without much risk of error, that here also he was St. Luke's informant as to what had passed in the Church with which he was so closely connected.<p><span class= "bld">A certain man named 'neas.</span>--The Greek name (we note the shortened vowel 'n?as of the later form of the word), perhaps, implies that he belonged to the Hellenistic section of the Church. Had the fame of Virgil's poem made the name of the Trojan hero known even in the plains of Palestine? In the care with which St. Luke records the circumstances of the case, the eight years of bedridden paralysis, we note a trace of professional exactness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-7.htm" title="And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.">Acts 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-18.htm" title="And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight immediately, and arose, and was baptized.">Acts 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.">Acts 28:8</a>. The word of "bed," used commonly of the couches of the lower class (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm" title="And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.">Matthew 2:4</a>), suggests the thought that poverty also was added to his sufferings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">- Went</span> for <span class="accented">passed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">all parts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) for <span class="accented">all quarters</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">All parts</span>. Afford, following Meyer, understands "through all the saints," which is scarcely so well. The current of St. Luke's narrative is here temporarily diverted from St. Paul, in order to trace that portion of St. Peter's apostolic work, which led immediately to that opening of the door of faith to the Gentiles in which Peter was to have the priority in point of time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18, 19</a>), but Paul the chief burden of labour and danger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>), and which was also the main subject of St. Luke's history. <span class="cmt_word">He came down</span>; Lydda (afterwards called Diospolis, now Ludd), being more than half-way between Jerusalem and the sea-coast at Joppa. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:32-35 Christians are saints, or holy people; not only the eminent ones, as Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but every sincere professor of the faith of Christ. Christ chose patients whose diseases were incurable in the course of nature, to show how desperate was the case of fallen mankind. When we were wholly without strength, as this poor man, he sent his word to heal us. Peter does not pretend to heal by any power of his own, but directs Eneas to look up to Christ for help. Let none say, that because it is Christ, who, by the power of his grace, works all our works in us, therefore we have no work, no duty to do; for though Jesus Christ makes thee whole, yet thou must arise, and use the power he gives thee.</body></html>
