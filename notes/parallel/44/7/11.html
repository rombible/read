In the coming famine, not of bread, but of sustenance for their spiritual life, they would have to turn to Him of whom they had been, in purpose and in act, the betrayers and murderers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Famine</span> for dearth, A.V.; <span class="accented">Egypt</span> for <span class="accented">the land of Egypt</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Canaan</span> for <span class="accented">Chanaan</span>, A.V. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 Stephen was charged as a blasphemer of God, and an apostate from the church; therefore he shows that he is a son of Abraham, and values himself on it. The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.</body></html>
