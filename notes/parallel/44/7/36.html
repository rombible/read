The words express different relations, it may be, of the same phenomena, rather than phenomena specifically different;--the first emphasising the wonder which the miracle produces, and therefore answering more strictly to that word; the latter, the fact that the miracle is a token or evidence of something beyond itself. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm" title="You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the middle of you, as you yourselves also know:">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-8.htm" title="And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.">Acts 6:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In the Red sea.</span>--It may be worth while noting that the familiar name comes to us, not from the Hebrew word, which means, literally, <span class= "ital">the Weed Sea, </span>but from the LXX. version, which Stephen, as a Hellenistic Jew, used, and which gave the word <span class= "ital">Erythraean, </span>or red, which had been used by Greek travellers from Herodotus onward. Why the name was given is an unsolved problem. Some have referred it to the colour of the coast; some to that of the sea-weed; some to an attempt to give an etymological translation of its name as the Sea of Edom (Edom, meaning "red," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-25.htm" title="And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.">Genesis 25:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-1.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.">Genesis 36:1</a>); some to a supposed connection with an early settlement of Ph?nicians, whose name had, with the Greeks, the same significance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> <span class="accented">- This man</span> for <span class="accented">he</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">led them forth</span> for <span class="accented">brought them out</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">having wrought</span> for <span class="accented">after that he had showed</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">Egypt</span> for <span class="accented">the land of Egypt</span>, A.V. and T.R. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:30-41 Men deceive themselves, if they think God cannot do what he sees to be good any where; he can bring his people into a wilderness, and there speak comfortably to them. He appeared to Moses in a flame of fire, yet the bush was not consumed; which represented the state of Israel in Egypt, where, though they were in the fire of affliction, yet they were not consumed. It may also be looked upon as a type of Christ's taking upon him the nature of man, and the union between the Divine and human nature. The death of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, cannot break the covenant relation between God and them. Our Saviour by this proves the future state, Mt 22:31. Abraham is dead, yet God is still his God, therefore Abraham is still alive. Now, this is that life and immortality which are brought to light by the gospel. Stephen here shows that Moses was an eminent type of Christ, as he was Israel's deliverer. God has compassion for the troubles of his church, and the groans of his persecuted people; and their deliverance takes rise from his pity. And that deliverance was typical of what Christ did, when, for us men, and for our salvation, he came down from heaven. This Jesus, whom they now refused, as their fathers did Moses, even this same has God advanced to be a Prince and Saviour. It does not at all take from the just honour of Moses to say, that he was but an instrument, and that he is infinitely outshone by Jesus. In asserting that Jesus should change the customs of the ceremonial law. Stephen was so far from blaspheming Moses, that really he honoured him, by showing how the prophecy of Moses was come to pass, which was so clear. God who gave them those customs by his servant Moses, might, no doubt, change the custom by his Son Jesus. But Israel thrust Moses from them, and would have returned to their bondage; so men in general will not obey Jesus, because they love this present evil world, and rejoice in their own works and devices.</body></html>
