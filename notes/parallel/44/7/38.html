(<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-16.htm" title="According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-12.htm" title="My foot stands in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.">Psalm 26:12</a>), for the "congregation" of Israel. Of the earlier versions. Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan, had given "congregation." Even the Rhemish contented itself with "assembly." The translators of 1611, acting on the instructions which were drawn up for their direction, did not see any reason for making this an exception to the rule, and so gave "church." Assuming that <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> was so rendered elsewhere, it was, it may be admitted, right, as a matter of consistency, that it should be used here, as presenting the thought, which was emphasised in Stephen's speech, that the society of believers in Christ was like, in character and in its relation to God, to that of Israel. The new <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> was the development of the old. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The lively oracles.</span>--The noun was used by the Greeks for the solemn utterances of the Pythian oracles, and thus came to be used by the LXX. in connection with the Urim and Thummim of the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>), and so for any answer from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-4.htm" title="He has said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:">Numbers 24:4</a>). In the New Testament it appears again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm" title="If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.

(Hebrew for Greek form); <span class="accented">living cracks</span> for <span class="accented">the lively</span> cracks, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In the church.</span> St. Stephen probably used the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> without any reference to its special meaning, "the Church." It is used in a secular sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-32.htm">Acts 19:32, 39</a>, and of the congregation of Israel in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>; 1 Macc. 2:56; Ecclus. 44:15; and elsewhere. In Stephen's time it could hardly have become widely known as the designation of the flock of Christ. On the whole, the marginal rendering, "the congregation," seems best, but with the idea attached that it was the Lord's congregation. <span class="cmt_word">The angel which spake</span>. It may be doubted whether the phrase, "the angel which spake to him in the mount Sinai," refers to the angel spoken of in ver. 30, or to the angel by whose mouth God spake the words of the ten commandments on Mount Sinai, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-1.htm">Deuteronomy 5:1-22</a>. Chrysostom and most commentators seem to understand it of the angel who gave the Law; but Whitby, not without reason, thinks the reference is to the burning bush. <span class="cmt_word">Living oracles</span>. In like manner, St. Paul calls the Holy Scriptures "the oracles of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a> we read again of "the first principles of the oracles of God," and St. Peter says, "Let him speak as the oracles of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>). For the force of the <span class="accented">living</span> or <span class="accented">lively</span> oracles, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23, 25</a>. Stephen magnifies Moses by reminding his hearers how he had received the Law from God to give to the people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:30-41 Men deceive themselves, if they think God cannot do what he sees to be good any where; he can bring his people into a wilderness, and there speak comfortably to them. He appeared to Moses in a flame of fire, yet the bush was not consumed; which represented the state of Israel in Egypt, where, though they were in the fire of affliction, yet they were not consumed. It may also be looked upon as a type of Christ's taking upon him the nature of man, and the union between the Divine and human nature. The death of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, cannot break the covenant relation between God and them. Our Saviour by this proves the future state, Mt 22:31. Abraham is dead, yet God is still his God, therefore Abraham is still alive. Now, this is that life and immortality which are brought to light by the gospel. Stephen here shows that Moses was an eminent type of Christ, as he was Israel's deliverer. God has compassion for the troubles of his church, and the groans of his persecuted people; and their deliverance takes rise from his pity. And that deliverance was typical of what Christ did, when, for us men, and for our salvation, he came down from heaven. This Jesus, whom they now refused, as their fathers did Moses, even this same has God advanced to be a Prince and Saviour. It does not at all take from the just honour of Moses to say, that he was but an instrument, and that he is infinitely outshone by Jesus. In asserting that Jesus should change the customs of the ceremonial law. Stephen was so far from blaspheming Moses, that really he honoured him, by showing how the prophecy of Moses was come to pass, which was so clear. God who gave them those customs by his servant Moses, might, no doubt, change the custom by his Son Jesus. But Israel thrust Moses from them, and would have returned to their bondage; so men in general will not obey Jesus, because they love this present evil world, and rejoice in their own works and devices.</body></html>
