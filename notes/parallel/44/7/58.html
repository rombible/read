So you shall put the evil away from among you.">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>). Our Lord, it will be remembered, had applied the rule in the case of the woman taken in adultery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-7.htm" title="So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.">John 8:7</a>). The loose, flowing cloak, which was worn as an outer garment, would have impeded the free action of their arms, and had therefore to be laid on one side.<p><span class= "bld">A young man's feet, whose name was Saul.</span>--As defined by Philo, on the authority of medical writers, the term thus used extended from twenty-one to twenty-eight years of age. Looking to the prominent position taken by Saul in this matter, and to his description of himself as "Paul the aged," A.D. 64 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm" title="Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.">Philemon 1:9</a>), it will be safe to assume that he had nearly attained the later limit. It will be convenient on this his first appearance to put together the chief facts of his life up to this period. He was of the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm" title="Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;">Philippians 3:5</a>), and had been named after its great hero-king. His father had obtained, perhaps as a freed-man, after a time of slavery at Rome, the privilege of Roman citizenship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-28.htm" title="And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.">Acts 22:28</a>). He had settled at Tarsus. The absence of any reference to him or to the Apostle's mother makes it probable that they were both dead before he appears on the scene. The son of a married sister is found, apparently residing in Jerusalem, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-16.htm" title="And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.">Acts 23:16</a>. At Tarsus the boy would probably receive a two-fold education, instructed at home in the Holy Scriptures daily, and in Greek literature and philosophy in the schools for which the city was famous. Traces of the knowledge thus acquired are found in his quotations from the Cilician poet Aratus (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>), Menander (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-33.htm" title="Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.">1Corinthians 15:33</a>), Epimenides (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a>), and the Festival Hymn quoted by him at Lystra (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>). At twelve he would become a child of the Law (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-42.htm" title="And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.">Luke 2:42</a>); and showing great devotion to the studies which thus opened on him, was probably dedicated by his parents to the calling of a scribe. This, however, did not involve the abandonment of secular occupation; and after some years spent in Jerusalem, studying under Gamaliel (we may say, with almost absolute certainty, before the commencement of our Lord's ministry), he returned to his native city, and became a "tent-maker" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a>)--a manufacturer, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the coarse goats' hair sail-cloth, for which Cilicia was famous. There seems reason to believe that somewhere about this time he became acquainted with Barnabas (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm" title="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,">Acts 4:36</a>), and possibly also with St. Luke (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm" title="And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel to them.">Acts 16:10</a>, and <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke's Gospel</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In the interval between the Ascension and the appointment of the Seven Deacons, he came up to Jerusalem. He finds a new sect, as it would seem, added to the three--the Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes--whom he had known before. In some respects their teaching is such as Hillel, the grandfather of Gamaliel, would have approved. They pray and fast, and give alms. They proclaim a resurrection and a judgment after death. They connect that proclamation with the belief that a teacher of Nazareth, who had died a malefactor's death, was the long-expected Messiah. What is he to think of these startling claims? What were others thinking? Gamaliel, his master, counselled caution and a policy of expectation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/5-35.htm" title="And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.">Acts 5:35-39</a>); Barnabas, his early friend, had joined the new society (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm" title="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,">Acts 4:36</a>); Andronicus and Junias, his kinsmen, had followed the example (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>). But Saul had a zeal which was more fiery than theirs. He was a Pharisee after the straitest sect, and the teaching of Stephen, more conspicuously, it would seem, than that of Peter, was a protest against Pharisaism, and told of its coming downfall. He, therefore, could make no truce with that teaching, and burst impatiently from the cautions of his master. For good or for evil, he was at least "thorough," and had the courage of his convictions. Even the face as of an angel and the words of ecstatic joy did but kindle in him the fire of a burning indignation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - <span class="accented">They cast</span> for <span class="accented">cast</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">garments</span> for <span class="accented">clothes</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the feet of a young man</span> for <span class="accented">a young man's feet</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">named Saul</span> for <span class="accented">whose name was Saul</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They cast</span>. We have here the identical phrase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-29.htm">Luke 4:29</a>. The witness. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>, "the hands of the witnesses were to be first upon" the idolater "to put him to death." They took off their clothes, their outer garments, so as to be free to hurl the stones at their victim with greater force. <span class="cmt_word">The feet of a young man</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is found only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-17.htm">Acts 23:17, 18, 22</a>; and frequently in the LXX. for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span>. A man might be called a <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> probably to the age of thirty. This appearance of Saul upon the stage of St. Luke's narrative is an element which will soon change the whole current of the narrative, and divert it from Jerusalem to the whole earth. Nothing can be more striking than this introduction of the young man Saul to our view as an accomplice (albeit "ignorantly in unbelief") in the martyrdom of Stephen. Who that stood there and saw him keeping the clothes of the witnesses would have imagined that he would become the foremost apostle of the faith which he sought to destroy from off the face of the earth? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:54-60 Nothing is so comfortable to dying saints, or so encouraging to suffering saints, as to see Jesus at the right hand of God: blessed be God, by faith we may see him there. Stephen offered up two short prayers in his dying moments. Our Lord Jesus is God, to whom we are to seek, and in whom we are to trust and comfort ourselves, living and dying. And if this has been our care while we live, it will be our comfort when we die. Here is a prayer for his persecutors. Though the sin was very great, yet if they would lay it to their hearts, God would not lay it to their charge. Stephen died as much in a hurry as ever any man did, yet, when he died, the words used are, he fell asleep; he applied himself to his dying work with as much composure as if he had been going to sleep. He shall awake again in the morning of the resurrection, to be received into the presence of the Lord, where is fulness of joy, and to share the pleasures that are at his right hand, for evermore.</body></html>
