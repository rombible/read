The narrative of Josephus (as above) and the references in the New Testament to Jannes and Jambres as the magicians who withstood Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.">2Timothy 3:8</a>), and to the dispute of Michael and Satan as to his body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>), indicate the wide acceptance of some such half-legendary history. The passage is instructive, (1) as an indirect plea on the part of Stephen, like that afterwards made by Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom. </span>i. 5, ? 28; 6:5, ? 42) and Justin (<span class= "ital">Dial. c. Tryph.</span> c. 1-4)<span class= "ital">, </span>for the recognition of heathen wisdom as an element in the divine education of mankind; (2) as having contributed to fix the attention of the more cultivated and scholarly of the early Christian critics, such as those named, and Origen, and Jerome, and Augustine, on the teaching of Greek poets and philosophers, and having furnished them with a sanction for such studies.<p><span class= "bld">Mighty in words and in deeds.</span>--Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 10), still following the same traditional history, relates that Moses commanded the Egyptian forces in a campaign against the Ethiopians, and protected them against the serpents that infected the country, by transporting large numbers of the ibis that feeds on serpents. The romance was completed by the marriage of Moses with the daughter of the Ethiopian king who had fallen passionately in love with him. This was possibly a development of the brief statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm" title="And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.">Numbers 12:1</a>. The language of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10</a>), in which he speaks of himself as "not eloquent" and "slow of speech," seems at first inconsistent with "mighty in words," but may fairly be regarded as simply the utterance of a true humility shrinking from the burden of a mighty task.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- Instructed</span> for <span class="accented">learned</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he was mighty</span> for <span class="accented">was mighty</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in his words and works</span> for <span class="accented">in words and in deeds</span>, A.V. and T.R. The statement of Moses being <span class="cmt_word">instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians</span>, though not found in Exodus, was doubtless true. Josephus makes Thermeutis speak of him as "of a noble understanding;" and says that he was "brought up with much care and diligence." And Philo, in his life of Moses(quoted by Whitby), says he was smiled in music, geometry, arithmetic, and hieroglyphics, and the whole circle of arts and sciences. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-29 Let us not be discouraged at the slowness of the fulfilling of God's promises. Suffering times often are growing times with the church. God is preparing for his people's deliverance, when their day is darkest, and their distress deepest. Moses was exceeding fair, fair toward God; it is the beauty of holiness which is in God's sight of great price. He was wonderfully preserved in his infancy; for God will take special care of those of whom he designs to make special use. And did he thus protect the child Moses? Much more will he secure the interests of his holy child Jesus, from the enemies who are gathered together against him. They persecuted Stephen for disputing in defence of Christ and his gospel: in opposition to these they set up Moses and his law. They may understand, if they do not wilfully shut their eyes against the light, that God will, by this Jesus, deliver them out of a worse slavery than that of Egypt. Although men prolong their own miseries, yet the Lord will take care of his servants, and effect his own designs of mercy.</body></html>
