(1) It is clearly an unfinished fragment, interrupted by the clamours of the by-standers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>)--the <span class= "ital">torso, </span>as it were, of a great <span class= "ital">apologia.</span> Its very incompleteness, the difficulty of tracing the argument as far as it goes, because we do not see how far it was meant to go, are indirect proofs that we have a true, though not necessarily a verbatim, report. A later writer, composing a speech after the manner of Herodotus and Thucydides, would have made it a much more direct answer to the charges in the indictment. And this, in its turn, supplies a reasonable presumption in favour of other speeches reported by the same author. (2) Looking to the relations between St. Luke and St. Paul, and to the prominence of the latter among the accusers of Stephen, there is a strong probability that the report was derived from him. This is confirmed by some instances of remarkable parallelism between the speech and his later teaching. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,">Acts 7:48</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-24.htm" title="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;">Acts 17:24</a>). (3) The speech is the first great survey of the history of Israel as a process of divine education--the first development from the lips of a human teacher of principles that had before been latent. As such, it contains the germs which were, in their turn, to be afterwards developed, on the one hand, by St. Paul in the Epistles known to be his, on the other hand by Apollos, or whoever was the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. (4) The speech is also remarkable as bringing together within a comparatively small compass a considerable number of real or seeming inaccuracies in the details of the history which is commented on. Whether they are real or apparent will be discussed as we deal with each of them. It is obvious that the results thus arrived at will form something like a crucial test of theories which men have formed as to the nature and limits of inspiration. (5) As Stephen was a Hellenistic or Greek-speaking Jew, it is probable that the speech was delivered in Greek, and so far it confirms the inference which has been drawn from the Aramaic words specially recorded in our Lord's teaching--"Ephphatha," "Talitha cumi," and the cry upon the cross--that He habitually used the former language, and that this was the medium of intercourse between the priests and Pilate. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-41.htm" title="And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say to you, arise.">Mark 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-34.htm" title="And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.">Mark 7:34</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The God of glory.</span>--The opening words are an implied answer to the charge of blaspheming God. The name contained an allusive reference to the Shechinah, or cloud of glory, which was the symbol of the Presence of Jehovah. That was the "glory of the Lord." He, in like manner, was the "Lord of glory." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Before he dwelt in Charran.</span>--We come, at the very outset, on one of the difficulties above referred to. Here the call of Abraham is spoken of as <span class= "ital">before</span> he sojourned in Haran, or Charran, west of the Euphrates. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a> it is first mentioned <span class= "ital">after</span> Abraham's removal thither. On the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-7.htm" title="And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.">Genesis 15:7</a> speaks of God as bringing him "from Ur of the Chaldees"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from Mesopotamia, or the east of the Euphrates; and this is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-3.htm" title="And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.">Joshua 24:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-7.htm" title="You are the LORD the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;">Nehemiah 9:7</a>. The language of writers contemporary with Stephen (Philo, <span class= "ital">De Abrah</span>.; Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> i. 7, ? 1) lays stress, as he does, on the first call as well as the second. Here, accordingly, it cannot be said that the statement is at variance with the Old Testament narrative. The word <span class= "ital">Mesopotamia</span> was used by the LXX., and has thence passed into later versions, for the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Aram-Naharaim, </span>"Syria of the two rivers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm" title="Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-8.htm" title="Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.">Judges 3:8</a>), and, less accurately, for Padan-Aram in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-20.htm" title="And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.">Genesis 25:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-2.htm" title="Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take you a wife from there of the daughers of Laban your mother's brother.">Genesis 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/28-5.htm" title="And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.">Genesis 28:5-6</a>; where our version retains the Hebrew name.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- Brethren and fathers</span> for <span class="accented">men, brethren, and fathers</span>, A.V. <span class="accented">Haran</span> for <span class="accented">Charran</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren and fathers</span>.

He adds "and fathers" out of respect to the elder and more dignified portion of the Sanhedrim. It seems probable that Stephen, as a Hellenist Jew, spoke in Greek, which is borne out by the quotations being from the LXX. (see Alford), though Meyer and others think he spoke in Hebrew. Greek was generally understood at this time by all educated persons (see Roberts, 'Discussions on Gospels,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. - 7.). The speech itself is almost universally admitted to bear strong internal marks of genuineness and originality. But different estimates have been formed of its excellence, and different explanations given of its scope and object. Difficult but striking; long and prolix;" "at first sight absurd and out of place;" "wonderful but difficult;" "of inestimable value;" "a speech containing many things which don't seem much to the point;" "a powerful speech;" a speech combining "the address of the advocate and the boldness of the martyr;" - are some of the estimates that have been formed of it by modern commentators. As regards its scope and object, the two main clues to it are the accusation which Stephen rose to rebut, and the application with which he ended in vers. 51-53. If we keep these two things steadily in view, we shall not be very far wrong if we say that Stephen sought to clear himself by showing, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by his historical summary, what a true and thorough Israelite he was in heart and feeling and fellowship with the fathers of his race, and therefore how unlikely to speak blasphemous words against either Moses or the temple; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> how Moses himself had foretold the coming of Christ as a prophet like himself, to enunciate some new doctrines; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> how at every stage of their history their fathers had resisted those who were sent to them by God, and that now his judges were playing the same part. Perhaps it may be further true, as Chrysostom explains it (Hom. 15, 16, 17.), that his intention in the early part of the speech was to show "that the promise was made before the place, before circumcision, before sacrifice, before the temple," in accordance with St. Paul's argument (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16-18</a>); and that therefore the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant could not be dependent upon the Law or the temple. <span class="cmt_word">The God of glory</span>. This unusual phrase identifies God, of whom Stephen speaks, with the God whose visible glory was seen by the patriarchs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-2.htm">Genesis 26:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-41.htm">John 12:41</a>). St. Paul uses a similar phrase, "The Lord of glory '(<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>). Our father. He thus identifies himself with his judges, whom he had just called "brethren." In <span class="cmt_word">Mesopotamia</span>, which would be in Hebrew "Aram of the two rivers." The exact place, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, was "Ur of the Chaldees;" whence the Israelites were taught to say (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>), "An Aramcan ready to perish was my father." That this appearance was in Ur, <span class="cmt_word">before he dwelt in Haran</span>, is manifest from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, because it is there said that they went forth from Ur "to go into the land of Canaan," which makes it quite certain that the appearance of God to Abraham had preceded their leaving Ur, and was the cause of it. And this is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>; and Josephus ('Ant.,' 1. 7:1). Moreover, the very language of the call shows plainly that it came to him when he was living in his native country, among his kindred, and in his father's house, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at Ur, not in Haran, where they were only sojourners. There is nothing the least unusual, in Hebrew narrative, in the writer going back to any point in the preceding narrative with which the subsequent narrative is connected. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>. I precedes in point of time <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>; similar examples are <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20, 21</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a>; and many more. It is, however, of course possible that a fresh call may have been given after Terah's death, though it is by no means necessary to suppose it. Another imaginary difficulty arises from the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a> that Abraham was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran, that Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and that Terah died at the age of two hundred and five; and from the statement in ver. 4 of this chapter that Abram did not leave Haran till Terah's death. From which it is concluded that Terah must have lived sixty years after Abram's departure (70 + 75 + 60 = 205). But the whole difficulty arises from the gratuitous supposition that Abram was Terah's firstborn because he is named first. If Terah were a hundred and thirty at the birth of Abram, he would be two hundred and five when Abram was seventy-five. Now, there is absolutely nothing to forbid the supposition that such was his age. It does not follow that because Abram is named first he was the eldest. He might be named first as being by far the most illustrious of the three, he might be named first because the subsequent genealogies - Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve Patriarchs - were deduced from him. There may, too, have been other sons of Terah, not named here because nothing was going to be said about them. Nahor is mentioned because Rebekah was his granddaughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15, 24</a>) and Rachel his great-granddaughter. And Haran is mentioned because he was the father of Lot. Others, whether sons or daughters, would not be mentioned. If Terah, therefore, began to have children when he was seventy, it is quite probable that Abram may not have been born till he was a hundred and thirty. That the son named first need not necessarily be the eldest is clear from the order in which Shem, Ham, and Japheth are named, whereas it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a> that Ham was the youngest, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2, 21</a> (according to the A.V. and the LXX., Symmachus, the Targum of Onkelos, and the old Jewish commentators), that Japheth was the eldest. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-4.htm">Joshua 24:4</a> God says, "I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau," though Esau was the elder; and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>. So again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20</a> we read, "Moses and Aaron" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-31.htm">Exodus 40:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-43.htm">Numbers 16:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-5.htm">Joshua 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>; etc.), though it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-3.htm">1 Chronicles 6:3</a> that Aaron was the eldest. So again we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, "Thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh," and in ver. 20, "God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh," though in ver. I of the same chapter they are named according to the true order of birth - "Manasseh and Ephraim." It is, therefore, an unwarrantable inference that Abram was the eldest son because he is named first; and with the removal of this inference the difficulty vanishes; and Stephen was quite accurate when he said that God appeared to Abraham in Ur, before he dwelt in Haran, and that he did not move from Haran till the death of Terah. <span class="cmt_word">Haran</span>. <span class="accented">Charran</span> in A.V. marks the difference between <span class="accented">Haran</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>), Lot's father, and the name of the place (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). It is called "the city of Nahor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a> compared with Genesis 47:43). It still exists as an Arab village, with the name of Harran (see 'Dictionary of Bible'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 Stephen was charged as a blasphemer of God, and an apostate from the church; therefore he shows that he is a son of Abraham, and values himself on it. The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.</body></html>
