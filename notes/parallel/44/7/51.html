The excitement of the Sanhedrin, perhaps of the listening crowd also, at this point, would seem to have become uncontrollable. The accused seemed to them to be repeating his offence with defiant boldness, and loud clamours took the place of whispered murmurs. Both the adjectives had been applied to the sins of the older Israel; "stiffnecked" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm" title="To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.">Exodus 33:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-5.htm" title="For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff necked people: I will come up into the middle of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do to you.">Exodus 33:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-9.htm" title="And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stiff necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.">Exodus 34:9</a>; "uncircumcised" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm" title="To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot listen: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.">Jeremiah 6:10</a>. The actual phrase "uncircumcised in heart" had been used by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-7.htm" title="In that you have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.">Ezekiel 44:7</a>) of "strangers." It was now applied to those who boasted of their exclusive privileges as Israelites, and it is scarcely possible for us to estimate the sharp incisiveness with which it, or its Aramaic equivalent, must have fallen on the ears of the Sanhedrin. It was to them all, and more than all, that "heretic" and "infidel" have been in the controversies of Christians. Here again, in St. Paul's "circumcision of the heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>), we have another echo from St. Stephen's speech.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stiff</span>-<span class="cmt_word">necked</span>; hard of neck, inflexible. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> only occurs here in the New Testament. But it answers in the LXX. to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e3;</span> (hard of neck); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm">Exodus 33:3, 5</a>, and elsewhere. In applying this expression to his hearers, Stephen was using the identical language of Moses when he conveyed God's rebuke to them. Considering that they professed to be standing on Moses' side against Stephen, this must have made his words doubly cutting to them. <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised in heart</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> only occurs here in the New Testament, but it is found in 2 Macc. 1:51 2Macc. 2:46; and in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-3.htm">Judges 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, and elsewhere for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>. The word, in its application to his Jewish audience, contains a whole volume of rebuke. They prided themselves on their circumcision, they trusted in it as a sure ground of favor in the sight of God; but all the while they were on a level with the heathen whom they despised, and were to be reckoned among the uncircumcised whom they loathed. For they were without the true circumcision, that of the heart. Here again Stephen was teaching in the exact spirit and even words of Moses and the prophets. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a> (where Stephen's two reproaches occur together); <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-7.htm">Ezekiel 44:7</a>; and many other passages. Compare the teaching of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; and elsewhere). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:51-53 Stephen was going on, it seems, to show that the temple and the temple service must come to an end, and it would be the glory of both to give way to the worship of the Father in spirit and in truth; but he perceived they would not bear it. Therefore he broke off, and by the Spirit of wisdom, courage, and power, sharply rebuked his persecutors. When plain arguments and truths provoke the opposers of the gospel, they should be shown their guilt and danger. They, like their fathers, were stubborn and wilful. There is that in our sinful hearts, which always resists the Holy Ghost, a flesh that lusts against the Spirit, and wars against his motions; but in the hearts of God's elect, when the fulness of time comes, this resistance is overcome. The gospel was offered now, not by angels, but from the Holy Ghost; yet they did not embrace it, for they were resolved not to comply with God, either in his law or in his gospel. Their guilt stung them to the heart, and they sought relief in murdering their reprover, instead of sorrow and supplication for mercy.</body></html>
