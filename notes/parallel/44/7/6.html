Taking the common computation, the interval between the covenant with Abraham and that with Moses was 430 years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>), of which only 215 are reckoned as spent in Egypt. The Israelites were indeed sojourners in a strange land for the whole 430 years, but the history shows that they were not in bondage nor evil entreated till the Pharaoh arose who knew not Joseph. The chronological difficulty, however, lies in reconciling St. Paul's statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a> with the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a>, which gives 400 years as the sojourning in Egypt, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a>, which gives 430, and with which St. Stephen is in substantial agreement. St. Paul appears to have followed the LXX. reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a>, which inserts "in the land of Cannan," and in some MSS. "they and their fathers," and with this the Samaritan Pentateuch agrees. Josephus varies, in some passages (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 15, ? 2), giving 215 years; in others (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 9, ? 1; <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>v. 9, ? 4), 400. All that can be said is, as before, that chronological accuracy did not affect the argument in either case. It was enough for St. Stephen, as for St. Paul, to accept this or that system of dates, as they had been taught, without inquiring into the grounds on which it rested. Such inquiries were foreign to the Jewish character generally, and above all to that character when possessed by the sense of new and divine realities. Round numbers were enough for them to mark the successive stages of God's dealings with His people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In a strange land</span>; a land belonging to some one else (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as here); a land in which he had none inheritance, not yet become the possession of his seed; for as the writer to the Hebrews says, he dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob; not applicable, therefore, in the first instance to Egypt at all. And this sojourning as strangers and pilgrims lasted altogether four hundred and thirty years, vie. two hundred and fifteen years in Canaan, and two hundred and fifteen in Egypt; which agrees exactly with St. Paul's reckoning in round numbers of four hundred years from the giving of the promise to Abraham to the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>). The "four hundred years" must not be taken in connection with the bondage" and the ill treatment which characterized the last half of the period, but as spoken of the whole period during which they had not possession of the promised land. <span class="cmt_word">Bring them into bondage</span>. So the LXX.; but the Hebrew, as rendered in the A.V., has "and they shall serve them." But some (see Gesenius, 'Thes.') render the Hebrew as the LXX. Do. <span class="cmt_word">Four hundred years</span>. This is a round number, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>. The exact time, as given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40, 41</a>, was four hundred and thirty years. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 Stephen was charged as a blasphemer of God, and an apostate from the church; therefore he shows that he is a son of Abraham, and values himself on it. The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.</body></html>
