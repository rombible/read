Envy had actuated the patriarchs when they sold Joseph; envy had led their descendants to deliver up Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-18.htm" title="For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.">Matthew 27:18</a>). But man's evil will had not frustrated God's gracious purpose. Joseph was made ruler over a kingdom. A greater glory might therefore be in store for Him who had now been rejected by them.<p><span class= "bld">Sold Joseph into Egypt.</span>--The objection that Joseph's brethren sold him not into Egypt, but to the Midianites and Ishmaelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-28.htm" title="Then there passed by Midianites merchants; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.">Genesis 37:28</a>), may well be dismissed as frivolous. They knew the trade which the Midianite slave-dealers carried on, and where their brother would be taken. So Joseph himself says of them "ye sold me hither" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-5.htm" title="Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here: for God did send me before you to preserve life.">Genesis 45:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him</span>, for <span class="accented">moved with envy sold Joseph</span>, A.V., more correctly, and in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11</a>, LXX.; <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Moved with jealousy</span>, etc. Here breaks out that part of Stephen's argument which went to show how the Israelites had always ill-used their greatest benefactors, and resisted the leaders sent to them by God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 Stephen was charged as a blasphemer of God, and an apostate from the church; therefore he shows that he is a son of Abraham, and values himself on it. The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.</body></html>
