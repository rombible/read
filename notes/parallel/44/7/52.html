Every witness for the truth had in his day had to suffer. The prophet was not only "without honour," but was exposed to shame, treated as an enemy, condemned to death. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:">1Thessalonians 2:15</a>, perhaps, reproduces the same fact, but more probably refers to the sufferings of the prophets of the Christian Church who were treated as their predecessors had been.<p><span class= "bld">The coming of the Just One.</span>--The name does not appear to have been one of the received titles of the expected Messiah, but may have been suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4-5</a>. It seems to have been accepted by the Church of Jerusalem, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1John 2:1</a>, and, perhaps, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-6.htm" title="You have condemned and killed the just; and he does not resist you.">James 5:6</a>, we find examples of its application. The recent use of it by Pilate's wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-19.htm" title="When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.">Matthew 27:19</a>) may have helped to give prominence to it. He who had been condemned as a malefactor was emphatically, above all the sons of men, the "righteous," the "Just One."<p><span class= "bld">The betrayers and murderers.</span>--The two words emphasise, the first the act of the Sanhedrin and the people, and secondly, the persistence with which they urged on Pilate the sentence of death, and which made them not merely accessories, but principals in the deed of blood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> <span class="accented">- Did not</span>... <span class="accented">persecute</span> for <span class="accented">have not</span>... <span class="accented">persecuted</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">killed</span> for <span class="accented">have slain</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">righteous</span> for <span class="accented">just</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">have now become</span> for <span class="accented">have</span> <span class="accented">been now</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">betrayers</span> for <span class="accented">the betrayers</span>, A.V. The close resemblance of Stephen's words to those of our Lord recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-33.htm">Luke 13:33, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-30.htm">Matthew 23:30, 31, 34-37</a>, lend some support to the tradition that he was one of the seventy, and had heard the Lord speak them. But the resemblance may have arisen from the Spirit by which he spake, "the Spirit of Christ which was in" him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:51-53 Stephen was going on, it seems, to show that the temple and the temple service must come to an end, and it would be the glory of both to give way to the worship of the Father in spirit and in truth; but he perceived they would not bear it. Therefore he broke off, and by the Spirit of wisdom, courage, and power, sharply rebuked his persecutors. When plain arguments and truths provoke the opposers of the gospel, they should be shown their guilt and danger. They, like their fathers, were stubborn and wilful. There is that in our sinful hearts, which always resists the Holy Ghost, a flesh that lusts against the Spirit, and wars against his motions; but in the hearts of God's elect, when the fulness of time comes, this resistance is overcome. The gospel was offered now, not by angels, but from the Holy Ghost; yet they did not embrace it, for they were resolved not to comply with God, either in his law or in his gospel. Their guilt stung them to the heart, and they sought relief in murdering their reprover, instead of sorrow and supplication for mercy.</body></html>
