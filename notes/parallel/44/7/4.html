This, <span class= "ital">prima facie, </span>suggests the conclusion that he lived for sixty years after his son's departure. The explanations sometimes given--(1) that Abraham may have been the youngest, not the eldest son of Terah, placed first in order of honour, not of time, as Shem is among the sons of Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-32.htm" title="And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.">Genesis 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-10.htm" title="And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.">Genesis 6:10</a>), though Japheth was the elder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm" title="To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.">Genesis 10:21</a>); and (2) that the marriage of Abraham's son with the granddaughter of Nahor by the youngest of his eight sons, Bethuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-22.htm" title="And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.">Genesis 22:22</a>), suggests some such difference of age, and that he may therefore have been born when Terah was 130, and so have remained in Haran till his father's death--though probable as an hypothesis, would hardly appear so natural an explanation as that the memory of St. Stephen or of his reporter dwelt upon the broad outlines of the history, and was indifferent to chronological details. It is remarkable that like difficulties present themselves in St. Paul's own survey of the history of Israel. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-20.htm" title="And after that he gave to them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.">Acts 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>.) A man speaking for his life, and pleading for the truth with a passionate eagerness, does not commonly carry with him a <span class= "ital">memoria technica</span> of chronological <span class= "ital">minuti?.</span> This seems, on the whole, a more satisfactory explanation than the assumption that the Apostle, having a clear recollection of the facts as we find them, brought them before his hearers in a form which presented at least the appearance of inaccuracy.<p><span class= "bld">He removed him.</span>--The change of subject may be noted as more natural in a speaker than a writer, and as so far confirming the inference that we have probably a <span class= "ital">verbatim</span> report.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Haran</span> for <span class="accented">Charran</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">God removed</span> for <span class="accented">he</span> removed, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The land of the Chaldaeans</span>.

The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.</body></html>
