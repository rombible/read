The fact was inferred partly, we may believe, from the rapt, fixed expression of the martyr's face, partly from the words that followed, interpreting that upward gaze. On the word for "looked up steadfastly," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-4.htm" title="And Peter, fastening his eyes on him with John, said, Look on us.">Acts 3:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Looked up steadfastly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-15.htm">Acts 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-4.htm">Acts 3:4</a>, and note. The glory of God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the visible glory which surrounds and proclaims God's near presence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10, 16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14, 23</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Jesus standing.</span> Sitting at the right hand of God is the usual attitude ascribed to our Lord in token of his victorious rest, and waiting for the day of judgment. Here he is seen standing, as rising to welcome his faithful martyr, and to place on his head the crown of life <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>). Whether Stephen saw these glorious things in the flesh or out of the flesh he probably knew not himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:54-60 Nothing is so comfortable to dying saints, or so encouraging to suffering saints, as to see Jesus at the right hand of God: blessed be God, by faith we may see him there. Stephen offered up two short prayers in his dying moments. Our Lord Jesus is God, to whom we are to seek, and in whom we are to trust and comfort ourselves, living and dying. And if this has been our care while we live, it will be our comfort when we die. Here is a prayer for his persecutors. Though the sin was very great, yet if they would lay it to their hearts, God would not lay it to their charge. Stephen died as much in a hurry as ever any man did, yet, when he died, the words used are, he fell asleep; he applied himself to his dying work with as much composure as if he had been going to sleep. He shall awake again in the morning of the resurrection, to be received into the presence of the Lord, where is fulness of joy, and to share the pleasures that are at his right hand, for evermore.</body></html>
