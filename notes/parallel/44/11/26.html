Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">got the name of Christians.</span> The Emperor Julian (<span class= "ital">Misopog., </span>p. 344) notes the tendency to invent nicknames, as a form of satire, as characteristic of the population of Antioch in his time, and the same tone of <span class= "ital">persiflage</span> seems to have prevailed on the first appearance of the new faith. The origin of a name which was afterwards to be so mighty in the history of the world is a subject full of interest. In its form it was essentially Latin, after the pattern of the <span class= "ital">Pompeiani, Sullani, </span>and other party-names; and so far it would seem to have grown out of the contact of the new society with the Romans stationed at Antioch, who, learning that its members acknowledged the <span class= "ital">Christos</span> as their head, gave them the name of <span class= "ital">Christiani.</span> In the Gospels, it is true, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm" title="And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.">Matthew 22:16</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>we find the analogous term of <span class= "ital">Herodiani, </span>but there, also, we may legitimately trace the influence of Roman associations. As used in the New Testament, we note (1) that the disciples never use it of themselves. They keep to such terms as the "brethren" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm" title="And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.">Acts 15:1</a>), and the "saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-13.htm" title="Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:">Acts 9:13</a>), and "those of the way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>). (2) That the hostile Jews use the more scornful term of "Nazarenes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm" title="For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:">Acts 24:5</a>). (3) That the term <span class= "ital">Christianus</span> is used as a neutral and sufficiently respectful word by Agrippa in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-23.htm" title="That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.">Acts 26:23</a>, and at a somewhat later date, when it had obviously gained a wider currency, as that which brought with it the danger of suffering and persecution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-16.htm" title="Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.">1Peter 4:16</a>). It was natural that a name first given by outsiders should soon be accepted by believers as a title in which to glory. Tradition ascribes its origin to Euodius, the first Bishop of Antioch (Bingham, <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> II. i. ? 4), and Ignatius, his successor, uses it frequently, and forms from it the hardly less important word of <span class= "ital">Christianismos, </span>as opposed to <span class= "ital">Judaismos </span>(<span class= "ital">Philadelph.</span> c. 6), and as expressing the whole system of faith and life which we know as "Christianity." It may be worth while to note that another ecclesiastical term, hardly less important in the history of Christendom, seems also to have originated at Antioch, and that we may trace to it the name of <span class= "ital">Catholic</span> as well as <span class= "ital">Christian</span> (Ignatius, <span class= "ital">Smyrn.</span> c. 8). We learn from Tertullian (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> c. 3) that the name was often wrongly pronounced as <span class= "ital">Chrestiani, </span>and its meaning not understood. Even the name of <span class= "ital">Christos</span> was pronounced and explained as <span class= "ital">Chrestos</span> (= good). The Christians, on their side, accepted the mistake as a <span class= "ital">nomen et omen, </span>an unconscious witness on the part of the heathen that they were good and worthy in their lives, that their Lord was "good and gracious (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> <span class="accented">- Even for a whole year</span> for a <span class="accented">whole year</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">they were gathered together</span> for <span class="accented">they assembled themselves</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and that the disciples</span> for <span class="accented">and the disciples</span>, A.V.

It should be "in," not "with." The "Church" is the assembly of disciples gathered together in their house of meeting. <span class="cmt_word">Were called</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, bore the name cf. It is a peculiar use of the word occurring in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3</a> besides, but found also in Polybius, Strabo, Josephus, and some other writers. Its common meaning is, in the passive voice, "to be warned of God," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-22.htm">Acts 10:22</a>, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">Christians</span>. It was a memorable event in the history of the Church when the name of <span class="accented">Christians</span>, which has distinguished them for nearly eighteen centuries and a half, was given to the disciples of Christ. Hitherto they had been called among themselves disciples, and brethren, and saints, and, by the Jews, men "of the Way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>), or "Nazarenes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>), but now they received the name of <span class="accented">Christians, as</span> followers of Christ, from the outside world, and accepted it themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>). From the Latin form of the word <span class="accented">Christians, i.e.</span> followers of Christ (like Herodians, followers of Herod; Marians, Pompeians, partisans of Marius and Pompey; Caesariani, Ciceroniani, Vitelliani, Flaviani, etc.; Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1:130; Lewin, vol. 1:97), the designation most have been invented by the Gentiles, either by the Roman court or camp at Antioch, or by the Greek population, influenced as they were by Roman forms of speech current amongst them (compare the Greece-Oriental Nestorians, Arians, etc.). We may be sure that <span class="accented">Christians, i.e.</span> followers of Messiah, is not a name likely to have been given by Jews. There is no evidence either of its having been given in derision. The well-known account of Tacitus is "Vulgus Christianos appella-bat. Auctor nominis ejus Christus, Tiberio imperitante, per Pontium Pilatum supplicio affectus erat" ('Annal.,' 15:44). Suidas says that those who had been previously called <span class="accented">Nazarenes</span> and <span class="accented">Galileans</span>, in the reign of Claudius Caesar, when Euodius had been made Bishop of Antioch by Peter, had their name changed into that of <span class="accented">Christians.</span> He seems to refer to the statement of Malalas (quoted by Conybeare and Howson, 1:131), that they who had been before called Nazarenes and Galileans received the name of <span class="accented">Christians</span> in the time of Euodius, who succeeded St. Peter as Bishop of Antioch, and who himself gave them this name." Malalas is thought to have lived somewhere between the sixth and ninth centuries, at Byzantium. A beautiful passage in the Clementine Liturgy is also quoted at p. 130: "We give thee thanks that we are called by the Name of thy Christ, and are thus reckoned as thine own," where the allusion is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>. The name <span class="accented">Christian</span> is frequent in the epistles of Ignatius, the Bishop of Antioch; Polycarp's dying words were, "I am a Christian" (Bishop Wordsworth). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:25-30 Hitherto the followers of Christ were called disciples, that is, learners, scholars; but from that time they were called Christians. The proper meaning of this name is, a follower of Christ; it denotes one who, from serious thought, embraces the religion of Christ, believes his promises, and makes it his chief care to shape his life by Christ's precepts and example. Hence it is plain that multitudes take the name of Christian to whom it does not rightly belong. But the name without the reality will only add to our guilt. While the bare profession will bestow neither profit nor delight, the possession of it will give both the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. Grant, Lord, that Christians may forget other names and distinctions, and love one another as the followers of Christ ought to do. True Christians will feel for their brethren under afflictions. Thus will fruit be brought forth to the praise and glory of God. If all mankind were true Christians, how cheerfully would they help one another! The whole earth would be like one large family, every member of which would strive to be dutiful and kind.</body></html>
