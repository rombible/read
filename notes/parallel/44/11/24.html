The word "good" is probably to be taken as presenting the more winning and persuasive form of holiness, as contrasted with the severer forms of simple justice. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-7.htm" title="For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.">Romans 5:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Full of the Holy Ghost.</span>--This was implied in his very name as "the Son of Prophecy" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-31.htm" title="And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.">Acts 4:31</a>); but it is interesting to note that the words are identical with those in which the historian had previously described Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>). Barnabas appeared to him to reproduce the mind and character of the martyr.<p><span class= "bld">Much people.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a great multitude, </span>implying a large increase upon the work related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-21.htm" title="And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.">Acts 11:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A good man</span>. The predominant idea in <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is simply "goodness," moral excellence. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-16.htm">Matthew 19:16</a>, "Good Master." To which our Lord answers, "There is none good but One." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-50.htm">Luke 23:50</a> Joseph of Arimathaea is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a good man and a righteous."

It is pleasing to read this testimony from Luke, Paul's companion and friend, <span class="cmt_word">Full of the Holy Ghost and of faith</span>. So Stephen is described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>) as "full of faith and of the Holy Spirit." The Holy Spirit is spoken of in both places as a Spirit of power and demonstration in preaching the Word. No reason is apparent why the R.T., having altered <span class="accented">Ghost</span> to <span class="accented">Spirit</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>, retains <span class="accented">Ghost</span> here. <span class="cmt_word">Much people</span>, etc.; the direct consequence of the energy of the Holy Ghost in Barnabas's ministry. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:19-24 The first preachers of the gospel at Antioch, were dispersed from Jerusalem by persecution; thus what was meant to hurt the church, was made to work for its good. The wrath of man is made to praise God. What should the ministers of Christ preach, but Christ? Christ, and him crucified? Christ, and him glorified? And their preaching was accompanied with the Divine power. The hand of the Lord was with them, to bring that home to the hearts and consciences of men, which they could but speak to the outward ear. They believed; they were convinced of the truth of the gospel. They turned from a careless, carnal way of living, to live a holy, heavenly, spiritual life. They turned from worshipping God in show and ceremony, to worship him in the Spirit and in truth. They turned to the Lord Jesus, and he became all in all with them. This was the work of conversion wrought upon them, and it must be wrought upon every one of us. It was the fruit of their faith; all who sincerely believe, will turn to the Lord, When the Lord Jesus is preached in simplicity, and according to the Scriptures, he will give success; and when sinners are thus brought to the Lord, really good men, who are full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, will admire and rejoice in the grace of God bestowed on them. Barnabas was full of faith; full of the grace of faith, and full of the fruits of the faith that works by love.</body></html>
