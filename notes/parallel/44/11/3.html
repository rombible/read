The same word is commonly used by St. Paul where he discusses the relation between circumcision and uncircumcision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-25.htm" title="For circumcision truly profits, if you keep the law: but if you be a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.">Romans 2:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-18.htm" title="Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.

It had been seized upon as the chief sting in their report by those who brought the news to Jerusalem. Observe the total absence of anything like papal domination on the part of Peter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-18 The imperfect state of human nature strongly appears, when godly persons are displeased even to hear that the word of God has been received, because their own system has not been attended to. And we are too apt to despair of doing good to those who yet, when tried, prove very teachable. It is the bane and damage of the church, to shut out those from it, and from the benefit of the means of grace, who are not in every thing as we are. Peter stated the whole affair. We should at all times bear with the infirmities of our brethren; and instead of taking offence, or answering with warmth, we should explain our motives, and show the nature of our proceedings. That preaching is certainly right, with which the Holy Ghost is given. While men are very zealous for their own regulations, they should take care that they do not withstand God; and those who love the Lord will glorify him, when made sure that he has given repentance to life to any fellow-sinners. Repentance is God's gift; not only his free grace accepts it, but his mighty grace works it in us, grace takes away the heart of stone, and gives us a heart of flesh. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.</body></html>
