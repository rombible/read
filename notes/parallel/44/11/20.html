Who they were we can only conjecture. Possibly Lucius of Cyrene, who appears in the list of prophets in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>; possibly Simon of Cyrene, of whom we have seen reason to think as a disciple of Christ. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-32.htm" title="And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.">Matthew 27:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-21.htm" title="And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.">Mark 15:21</a>.) The founders of the Church of Antioch, like those of the Church of Rome, must remain unknown.<p><span class= "bld">Spake unto the Grecians.</span>--The MSS. present the two readings--<span class= "ital">Hellenistae</span> Greek-speaking Jews, and <span class= "ital">Hellenes, </span>Greeks or Gentiles by descent. As far as their authority is concerned, the two stand nearly on the same level, the balance inclining slightly in favour of <span class= "ital">Hellenistae, </span>which is found in MSS. B and D, while A gives <span class= "ital">Hellenes.</span> The Sinaitic has the almost incomprehensible reading "they spake unto the <span class= "ital">Evangelist?,"</span> which is obviously wrong, but which, so far as it goes, must be thrown into the scale in favour of <span class= "ital">Hellenistae, </span>as the word which the transcriber had before him, and which he misread or misheard. If we receive that reading, then we must suppose St. Luke to lay stress upon the fact that the preachers of whom he speaks, instead of speaking to the Jews at large, many of whom, being Syrians, would speak Aramaic, addressed themselves specially to the Greek-speaking Jews and proselytes, and were thus following in St. Stephen's footsteps, and indirectly preparing the way for St. Paul--the Hellenistae being, as a body, the link between the Jews as a race and the Hellenes. On the whole, however, internal evidence seems to turn the scale in favour of the other reading. (1) As the Hellenistae were "Jews," though not "Hebrews," they would naturally be included in the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm" title="Now they which were scattered abroad on the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but to the Jews only.">Acts 11:19</a>, and so there would be no contrast, no new advance, indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a> in the statement that the word was spoken to them. (2) The contrast between Jews and Hellenes is, on the other hand, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.">Acts 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-4.htm" title="And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.">Acts 18:4</a>, a perfectly natural and familiar one, and assuming this to be the true reading, we get a note of progress which otherwise we should miss, there being no record elsewhere of the admission of the Gentiles at Antioch. (3) It does not necessarily follow, however, that the Hellenes who are spoken of had been heathen idolaters up to the time of their conversion. Probably, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-4.htm" title="And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.">Acts 18:4</a>, they were more or less on the same level as Cornelius, proselytes of the gate, attending the services of the synagogue. (4) The question whether this preceded or followed the conversion of Cornelius is one which we have not sufficient <span class= "ital">data</span> for deciding. On the one hand, the brief narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm" title="Now they which were scattered abroad on the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but to the Jews only.">Acts 11:19</a> suggests the thought of an interval as long as that between the death of Stephen and St. Peter's visit to Caesarea, and it may have been part of the working of God's providence that there should be simultaneous and parallel advances. On the other, the language of those of the circumcision to Peter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-3.htm" title="Saying, You went in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them.">Acts 11:3</a>, implies that they had not heard of such a case before; and that of the Apostle himself, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-7.htm" title="And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.">Acts 15:7</a>, distinctly claims the honour of having been the first (possibly, however, only the first among the disciples at Jerusalem) from whose lips the Gentiles, as such, had heard the word of the gospel. On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that the work went on at Antioch for many months among the Hellenistic and other Jews, and that the men of Cyprus and Cyrene arrived after the case of Cornelius had removed the scruples which had hitherto restrained them from giving full scope to the longings of their heart. We must not forget, however, that there was one to whom the Gospel of the Uncircumcision, the Gospel of Humanity, had been already revealed in its fulness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-21.htm" title="Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.">Acts 20:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/1-11.htm" title="But I certify you, brothers, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.">Galatians 1:11-12</a>), and we can hardly think of him as waiting, after that revelation, for any decision of the Church of Jerusalem. His action, at any rate, must have been parallel and independent, and may have been known to, and followed by, other missionaries.<p><span class= "bld">Preaching the Lord Jesus.</span>--As before, <span class= "ital">preaching the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> <span class="accented">But there were some of them...</span> who for <span class="accented">and some of them were.., which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Greeks also</span> for <span class="accented">the Grecians</span>, A.V. and T.R. This last is a most important variation of reading - <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, Greeks for <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, Grecians, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Grecian Jews, or Hellenists. It is supported, however, by strong authority of manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, and is accepted by Grotius, Witsius, Griesbach, Lachman, Tischendorf, Meyer, Conybeare and Howson, Alford, Westcott, Bishop Lightfoot, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' (apparently) and most modern critics. It is also strongly argued that the internal evidence proves <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> to be the right reading, because the statement that the men of Cyprus and Cyrene preached the gospel to them is contrasted with the action of the others, who preached to the Jews only. Obviously, therefore, these Hellenes were not Jews. Moreover, there was nothing novel in the conversion and admission into the Church of Hellenistic Jews (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>, etc.; Acts 9:22, 29). And these very preachers were in all probability Hellenists themselves. Bishop Wordsworth, however, on the contrary, defends, though with doubt, the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; and argues that even if <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is the right reading, it must mean the same as <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. He also hints that it might mean "proselytes" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>, where the Hellenes attend the synagogue, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>). But there is no evidence that these were proselytes any more than Cornelius was. The Hellenes, or Greeks, here were probably uncircumcised Greeks who feared God, like Cornelius, and attended the synagogue worship (see Meyer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>). It is very likely that in Antioch, where the Jews occupied such a prominent position, some of the Greek inhabitants should be attracted by their doctrines and worship, repelled, perhaps, by the prevalent superstitions and profligate levity of the great city. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:19-24 The first preachers of the gospel at Antioch, were dispersed from Jerusalem by persecution; thus what was meant to hurt the church, was made to work for its good. The wrath of man is made to praise God. What should the ministers of Christ preach, but Christ? Christ, and him crucified? Christ, and him glorified? And their preaching was accompanied with the Divine power. The hand of the Lord was with them, to bring that home to the hearts and consciences of men, which they could but speak to the outward ear. They believed; they were convinced of the truth of the gospel. They turned from a careless, carnal way of living, to live a holy, heavenly, spiritual life. They turned from worshipping God in show and ceremony, to worship him in the Spirit and in truth. They turned to the Lord Jesus, and he became all in all with them. This was the work of conversion wrought upon them, and it must be wrought upon every one of us. It was the fruit of their faith; all who sincerely believe, will turn to the Lord, When the Lord Jesus is preached in simplicity, and according to the Scriptures, he will give success; and when sinners are thus brought to the Lord, really good men, who are full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, will admire and rejoice in the grace of God bestowed on them. Barnabas was full of faith; full of the grace of faith, and full of the fruits of the faith that works by love.</body></html>
