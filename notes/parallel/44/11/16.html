Then it had seemed to refer only to the disciples, and the Day of Pentecost had appeared to bring a complete fulfilment of it. Now Peter had learnt to see that it had a wider range, that the gift might be bestowed on those who were not of Israel, and who were not called to come outwardly within the covenant of Israel. If the baptism of the Holy Ghost had been thus given to them it implied, as the greater includes the less, that they were admissible to the baptism of water.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- And I remembered</span> for <span class="accented">then remembered I</span>, A.V.

This saying of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> being thus referred to by Peter looks as if Peter might have furnished many of the particulars in the first twelve chapters to Luke. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-18 The imperfect state of human nature strongly appears, when godly persons are displeased even to hear that the word of God has been received, because their own system has not been attended to. And we are too apt to despair of doing good to those who yet, when tried, prove very teachable. It is the bane and damage of the church, to shut out those from it, and from the benefit of the means of grace, who are not in every thing as we are. Peter stated the whole affair. We should at all times bear with the infirmities of our brethren; and instead of taking offence, or answering with warmth, we should explain our motives, and show the nature of our proceedings. That preaching is certainly right, with which the Holy Ghost is given. While men are very zealous for their own regulations, they should take care that they do not withstand God; and those who love the Lord will glorify him, when made sure that he has given repentance to life to any fellow-sinners. Repentance is God's gift; not only his free grace accepts it, but his mighty grace works it in us, grace takes away the heart of stone, and gives us a heart of flesh. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.</body></html>
