But Meyer thinks it is a mere clerical error for the reading of the T.R. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is used in the LXX for "a tumultuous assembly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-9.htm">Numbers 26:9</a>; 3Esdr. 25:9), and in Josephus, 'Contr. Apion.,' 1:20, of a conspiracy or revolt. In the LXX. also the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "to rise in revolt against" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-9.htm">Numbers 26:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:10-21 Paul gives a just account of himself, which clears him from crime, and likewise shows the true reason of the violence against him. Let us never be driven from any good way by its having an ill name. It is very comfortable, in worshipping God, to look to him as the God of our fathers, and to set up no other rule of faith or practice but the Scriptures. This shows there will be a resurrection to a final judgment. Prophets and their doctrines were to be tried by their fruits. Paul's aim was to have a conscience void of offence. His care and endeavour was to abstain from many things, and to abound in the exercises of religion at all times; both towards God. and towards man. If blamed for being more earnest in the things of God than our neighbours, what is our reply? Do we shrink from the accusation? How many in the world would rather be accused of any weakness, nay, even of wickedness, than of an earnest, fervent feeling of love to the Lord Jesus Christ, and of devotedness to his service! Can such think that He will confess them when he comes in his glory, and before the angels of God? If there is any sight pleasing to the God of our salvation, and a sight at which the angels rejoice, it is, to behold a devoted follower of the Lord, here upon earth, acknowledging that he is guilty, if it be a crime, of loving the Lord who died for him, with all his heart, and soul, and mind, and strength. And that he will not in silence see God's word despised, or hear his name profaned; he will rather risk the ridicule and the hatred of the world, than one frown from that gracious Being whose love is better than life.</body></html>
