The comparative implies a reference to an average standard. Felix was too well-informed to yield any answer to the declamatory statements of Tertullus. He saw that the prisoner was no common <span class= "ital">Sicarius, </span>or leader of sedition. He knew something as to the life of the sect of Nazarenes. That knowledge may well have been acquired either at Jerusalem, which the procurator would naturally visit at the great festivals and other occasions, or at Caesarea, where, as we know, Philip the Evangelist had, some twenty-five years before, founded a Christian community, which included among its members Cornelius and other Roman soldiers, or even, we may add, in the imperial capital itself. His wife Drusilla, also, the daughter of Herod Agrippa I., may have contributed something to his knowledge.<p><span class= "bld">I will know the uttermost of your matter.</span>--Leaving the general attack on the "way" of the Nazarenes, or Christians, Felix proposes to inquire into the actual circumstances of the case brought before him. It is remarkable that this adjournment leads to an indefinite postponement. Possibly the accusers felt that they had fired their last shot in the speech of Tertullus, and, seeing that that had failed, thought that the judge had made up his mind against them, and withdrew from the prosecution. The detention of the prisoner under such circumstances was only too common an incident in the provincial administration of justice in the Roman empire, as it has since been in other corrupt or ill-governed states.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying</span> for <span class="accented">and whoa Felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">determine</span> for <span class="accented">know the uttermost of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Having more exact knowledge</span>, etc. At Caesarea, Felix must have seen and heard something of Christianity. The conversion of Cornelius with his household and friends, men belonging to the dominant Roman power; the work of Philip the evangelist, residing probably for some years at Caesarea, and working among Romans as well as Jews, must have given Felix some knowledge of "the Way." He would learn something, too, both of Judaism and Christianity from Drusilla, his wife (ver. 24, note). <span class="cmt_word">When Lysias... shall come</span> (see vers. 7, 8, and note). <span class="cmt_word">I will determine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-15.htm">Acts 23:15</a>, where the verb is in the active voice, and is rendered in the R.V. "to judge." The idea of the word is "to know with discrimination;" and this is the sense it has in medical writers, who use it very frequently; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Galen says, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (quoted by Hobart). Hence the "diagnosis" of an illness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-15.htm">Acts 23:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:22-27 The apostle reasoned concerning the nature and obligations of righteousness, temperance, and of a judgment to come; thus showing the oppressive judge and his profligate mistress, their need of repentance, forgiveness, and of the grace of the gospel. Justice respects our conduct in life, particularly in reference to others; temperance, the state and government of our souls, in reference to God. He who does not exercise himself in these, has neither the form nor the power of godliness, and must be overwhelmed with the Divine wrath in the day of God's appearing. A prospect of the judgment to come, is enough to make the stoutest heart to tremble. Felix trembled, but that was all. Many are startled by the word of God, who are not changed by it. Many fear the consequences of sin, yet continue in the love and practice of sin. In the affairs of our souls, delays are dangerous. Felix put off this matter to a more convenient season, but we do not find that the more convenient season ever came. Behold now is the accepted time; hear the voice of the Lord to-day. He was in haste to turn from hearing the truth. Was any business more urgent than for him to reform his conduct, or more important than the salvation of his soul! Sinners often start up like a man roused from his sleep by a loud noise, but soon sink again into their usual drowsiness. Be not deceived by occasional appearances of religion in ourselves or in others. Above all, let us not trifle with the word of God. Do we expect that as we advance in life our hearts will grow softer, or that the influence of the world will decline? Are we not at this moment in danger of being lost for ever? Now is the day of salvation; tomorrow may be too late.</body></html>
