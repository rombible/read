Possibly, however, the five days may start from St. Paul's departure from Jerusalem and this agrees, on the whole, better with the reckoning of the twelve days from the Apostle's arrival there, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-11.htm" title="Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.">Acts 24:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Descended.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">came down, </span>in accordance with the usage of modern English.<p><span class= "bld">A certain orator named Tertullus.</span>--Men of this class were to be found in most of the provincial towns of the Roman empire, ready to hold a brief for plaintiff or defendant, and bringing to bear the power of their glib eloquence, as well as their knowledge of Roman laws, on the mind of the judge. There is not the slightest ground for supposing, as some have done, that the proceedings were conducted in Latin, and that while the chief priests were obliged to employ an advocate to speak in that language, St. Paul, who had never learnt it, was able to speak at once by a special inspiration. Proceedings before a procurator of Judaea and the provincials under him were almost of necessity, as in the case of our Lord and Pilate, in Greek. Had St. Paul spoken in Latin, St. Luke, who records when he spoke in Hebrew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-40.htm" title="And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,">Acts 21:40</a>), and when in Greek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-37.htm" title="And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to you? Who said, Can you speak Greek?">Acts 21:37</a>), was not likely to have passed the fact over; nor is there any evidence, even on that improbable assumption, that St. Paul himself, who was, we know, a Roman citizen, had no previous knowledge of the language. The strained hypothesis breaks down at every point. The name of the orator may be noted as standing half-way between Tertius and Tertullianus.<p><span class= "bld">Who informed the governor against Paul.</span>--The word is a technical one, and implies something of the nature of a formal indictment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- The high priest Ananias came down</span> for <span class="accented">Ananias the high priest descended</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">certain elders</span> for <span class="accented">the elders</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">an orator, one Tertullus</span> for <span class="accented">a certain orator named Tertullus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and they</span> for <span class="accented">who</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">After five days</span>.

God's prophets were charged with being troublers of the land, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that he perverted the nation; the very same charges were brought against Paul. The selfish and evil passions of men urge them forward, and the graces and power of speech, too often have been used to mislead and prejudice men against the truth. How different will the characters of Paul and Felix appear at the day of judgement, from what they are represented in the speech of Tertullus! Let not Christians value the applause, or be troubled at the revilings of ungodly men, who represent the vilest of the human race almost as gods, and the excellent of the earth as pestilences and movers of sedition.</body></html>
