The use of "many" in this instance may be noted as throwing light on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-10.htm" title="Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, For as much as I know that you have been of many years a judge to this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:">Acts 24:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</span>--The "alms" were, of course, the large sums of money which St. Paul had been collecting, since his last visit, for the disciples (possibly in part, also, for those who were not disciples) at Jerusalem. It is noticeable that this is the only mention in the Acts of that which occupies so prominent a place in the Epistles of this period. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;">2Corinthians 8:1-4</a>.) The manifestly undesigned coincidence between the Acts and the Epistles on this point has naturally often been dwelt on by writers on the evidences which each supplies to the other. The "offerings" were the sacrifices which the Apostle was about to offer on the completion of the Nazarite vow with which he had associated himself. There is, perhaps, a refined courtesy in St. Paul's use of the word "nation" (commonly used only of the heathen) instead of the more usual "people." He avoids the term which would have implied a certain assumption of superiority to the magistrate before whom he stood. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm" title="And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats:">Matthew 25:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After many years</span>; or, <span class="accented">several years.</span> St. Paul's last visit to Jerusalem was that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>. Since then he had spent "some time" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>) at Antioch, had gone over all the country of Phrygia and Galatia, had come to Ephesus, and stopped between two and three years there, had gone through Macedonia, had spent three months at Corinth, had returned to Macedonia, and from thence had come to Jerusalem in about fifty days. All which must have occupied four or five years - from A.D. to A.D. - according to most chronologers. Evidently Paul had not been plotting seditious movements at Jerusalem, where he had only arrived twelve days before, for a purely benevolent and pious purpose, after an absence of four or five years <span class="cmt_word">Alms... and offerings</span>. Those of which he speaks in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25, 26, 31</a>. To this may be added "the charges" for which he made himself answerable for the poor Nazarites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24, 26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:10-21 Paul gives a just account of himself, which clears him from crime, and likewise shows the true reason of the violence against him. Let us never be driven from any good way by its having an ill name. It is very comfortable, in worshipping God, to look to him as the God of our fathers, and to set up no other rule of faith or practice but the Scriptures. This shows there will be a resurrection to a final judgment. Prophets and their doctrines were to be tried by their fruits. Paul's aim was to have a conscience void of offence. His care and endeavour was to abstain from many things, and to abound in the exercises of religion at all times; both towards God. and towards man. If blamed for being more earnest in the things of God than our neighbours, what is our reply? Do we shrink from the accusation? How many in the world would rather be accused of any weakness, nay, even of wickedness, than of an earnest, fervent feeling of love to the Lord Jesus Christ, and of devotedness to his service! Can such think that He will confess them when he comes in his glory, and before the angels of God? If there is any sight pleasing to the God of our salvation, and a sight at which the angels rejoice, it is, to behold a devoted follower of the Lord, here upon earth, acknowledging that he is guilty, if it be a crime, of loving the Lord who died for him, with all his heart, and soul, and mind, and strength. And that he will not in silence see God's word despised, or hear his name profaned; he will rather risk the ridicule and the hatred of the world, than one frown from that gracious Being whose love is better than life.</body></html>
