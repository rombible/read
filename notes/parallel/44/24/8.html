Tertullus apparently suggests that the judge should interrogate the prisoner--perhaps, by using a technical term, with a well-understood significance, that he should examine him by scourging, or some other mode of torture. Strictly speaking, the "examination" of Which Tertullus speaks was a preliminary inquiry, previous to the actual trial, to ascertain whether there were sufficient grounds for further proceedings. It will be observed that he keeps back the fact of St. Paul's being a Roman, and it does not follow that Tertullus knew that Lysias had informed Felix of it. It is possible, however, after all, if we admit the genuineness of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-7.htm" title="But the chief captain Lysias came on us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,">Acts 24:7</a>, that the relative pronoun may refer to Lysias and not to the Apostle; and this agrees with the language of Felix in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-22.htm" title="And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.">Acts 24:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- From whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take</span> for <span class="accented">by examining of whom thyself mayest take</span>, A.V.

God's prophets were charged with being troublers of the land, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that he perverted the nation; the very same charges were brought against Paul. The selfish and evil passions of men urge them forward, and the graces and power of speech, too often have been used to mislead and prejudice men against the truth. How different will the characters of Paul and Felix appear at the day of judgement, from what they are represented in the speech of Tertullus! Let not Christians value the applause, or be troubled at the revilings of ungodly men, who represent the vilest of the human race almost as gods, and the excellent of the earth as pestilences and movers of sedition.</body></html>
