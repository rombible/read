In classical Greek its secondary sense was a "sect" or "school" of philosophy, Academics, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans, etc. The Jews applied it to their own different schools of thought. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a> we read, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">The</span> sect of the Sadducees;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">The</span> sect of the Pharisees;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a> St. Paul speaks of himself as having been a Pharisee, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "After the straitest sect of our religion" (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>). It begins to have a bad sense in St. Paul's Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, where, however, it gets its bad sense from the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> joined to it). In ecclesiastical writers it came to have its worst sense of "heresy" <span class="accented">as</span> something worse even than "<span class="accented">schism."</span> In this reference to Tertullus's phrase, St. Paul seems hardly to admit that Christianity was properly called "a sect" by the Jews, but gives it the milder term of "the Way" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">The God of our [my] father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-17.htm">Acts 28:17</a>.

Let us never be driven from any good way by its having an ill name. It is very comfortable, in worshipping God, to look to him as the God of our fathers, and to set up no other rule of faith or practice but the Scriptures. This shows there will be a resurrection to a final judgment. Prophets and their doctrines were to be tried by their fruits. Paul's aim was to have a conscience void of offence. His care and endeavour was to abstain from many things, and to abound in the exercises of religion at all times; both towards God. and towards man. If blamed for being more earnest in the things of God than our neighbours, what is our reply? Do we shrink from the accusation? How many in the world would rather be accused of any weakness, nay, even of wickedness, than of an earnest, fervent feeling of love to the Lord Jesus Christ, and of devotedness to his service! Can such think that He will confess them when he comes in his glory, and before the angels of God? If there is any sight pleasing to the God of our salvation, and a sight at which the angels rejoice, it is, to behold a devoted follower of the Lord, here upon earth, acknowledging that he is guilty, if it be a crime, of loving the Lord who died for him, with all his heart, and soul, and mind, and strength. And that he will not in silence see God's word despised, or hear his name profaned; he will rather risk the ridicule and the hatred of the world, than one frown from that gracious Being whose love is better than life.</body></html>
