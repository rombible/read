The administration of Felix did not present much opening for panegyric, but he had at least taken strong measures to put down the gangs of <span class= "ital">sicarii</span> and brigands by whom Palestine was infested (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xx.</span> 8, ? 5; <span class= "ital">Wars, ii.</span> 13, ? 2), and Tertullus shows his skill in the emphasis which he lays on "quietness." By a somewhat interesting coincidence, Tacitus (<span class= "ital">Ann. xii.</span> 54), after narrating the disturbances caused by a quarrel between Felix, backed by the Samaritans, and Ventidius Cumanus, who had been appointed as governor of Galilee, ends his statement by relating that Felix was supported by Quadratus, the president of Syria, "et <span class= "ital">quies</span> provinciae reddita."<p><span class= "bld">That very worthy deeds . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">reforms, </span>or <span class= "ital">improvements;</span> the better MSS. giving a word which expresses this meaning, and the others one which implies it. This, as before, represents one aspect of the procurator's administration. On the other hand, within two years of this time, he was recalled from his province, accused by the Jews at Rome, and only escaped punishment by the intervention of his brother Pallas, then as high in favour with Nero as he had been with Claudius (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xx.</span> 8, ? 10).<p><span class= "bld">By thy providence . . .</span>--The Greek word had at this time, like the English, a somewhat higher sense than "prudence" or "forethought." Men spoke then, as now, of the "providence" of God, and the tendency to clothe the emperors with quasi-divine attributes led to the appearance of this word--"the providence of Caesar"--on their coins and on medals struck in their honour. Tertullus, after his manner, goes one step further, and extends the term to the procurator of Judaea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Called</span> for <span class="accented">called forth</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">much peace</span> for <span class="accented">great quietness</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">evils are corrected for</span> for <span class="accented">very worthy deeds are done unto</span>, A.V. and T.R.; there is also a change in the order of the words, <span class="accented">by thy providence is</span> placed at the beginning instead of at the end of the sentence. <span class="cmt_word">When he was called</span>. We see here the order of the trial. As soon as the charge is laid against, the prisoner, he is called into court, to hear what his accusers have to say against him, and as it follows at ver. 10, to make his defense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-16.htm">Acts 25:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We enjoy much peace</span>. The groan flattery of this address of the hired orator, placed at the beginning of his speech, in order to win the favor of the judge, is brought into full light by comparing Tacitus's account of the misconduct of Felix in Samaria in the reign of Claudius, who he says, thought he might commit any crime with impunity, and by his proceedings nearly caused a civil war ('Annah,' 12:54); and his character of him as a ruler of boundless cruelty and profligacy, using the power of a king with the temper of a slave ('Hist' 5. 9.); and Josephus s statement that no sooner was Felix recalled from his government than the chief men among the Jews at Caesarea went up to Rome to accuse him before Nero, when he narrowly escaped punishment through the influence of his brother Pallas. <span class="cmt_word">By thy providence</span>. "Providentia Caesaris" is a common legend on Roman coins (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Evils are corrected</span>. The reading of the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, meaning "reforms," occurs only here, but, like the kindred <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of the T.R., is a medical term. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, reformation, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of the T.R. (which also occurs nowhere else in the New Testament) means, in its classical use, either "successful actions" or "right actions;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is to "bring things to a successful issue." Possibly Tertullus may have had in view the successful attack on the Egyptian impostor (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-38.htm">Acts 21:38</a>, note), or the wholesale crucifixion of Sicarii and other disturbers of the public peace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 See here the unhappiness of great men, and a great unhappiness it is, to have their services praised beyond measure, and never to be faithfully told of their faults; hereby they are hardened and encouraged in evil, like Felix. God's prophets were charged with being troublers of the land, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that he perverted the nation; the very same charges were brought against Paul. The selfish and evil passions of men urge them forward, and the graces and power of speech, too often have been used to mislead and prejudice men against the truth. How different will the characters of Paul and Felix appear at the day of judgement, from what they are represented in the speech of Tertullus! Let not Christians value the applause, or be troubled at the revilings of ungodly men, who represent the vilest of the human race almost as gods, and the excellent of the earth as pestilences and movers of sedition.</body></html>
