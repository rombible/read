St. Paul, we may well believe, did not look like a <span class= "ital">sicarius, </span>or brigand, but Tertullus could not have used stronger language had he been caught red-handed in the fact.<p><span class= "bld">A mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world.</span>--The "world" is, of course, here, as elsewhere, the Roman empire. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>.) The language may simply be that of vague invective, but we may perhaps read between the lines some statements gathered, in preparing the case, from the Jews of Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm" title="And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brothers to the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come here also;">Acts 17:6</a>) and Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-28.htm" title="Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.">Acts 21:28</a>) who had come to keep the Feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">A ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</span>--This is the first appearance of the term of reproach as transferred from the Master to the disciples.

It has continued to be used by both Jews and Mahometans; and it has been stated (Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict. of Bible, </span>Art.

The construction of the sentence is an anacoluthon.

This was the charge most likely to weigh with a Roman procurator in the then disturbed and turbulent state of the Jewish mind (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12</a>). Felix himself had had large experience of Jewish insurrections. The Jewish riots at Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20</a>), at Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a>), at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>), at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>), and at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-30.htm">Acts 21:30</a>), would give color to the accusation. <span class="cmt_word">The world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>).

Also, in the plural, the soldiers in the front rank. <span class="cmt_word">The sect of the Nazarenes</span>. As our Lord was contemptuously called "The Nazarene "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-71.htm">Matthew 26:71</a>), so the Jews designated his disciples" Nazarenes." They would not admit that they were Christians, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> disciples of the Messiah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 See here the unhappiness of great men, and a great unhappiness it is, to have their services praised beyond measure, and never to be faithfully told of their faults; hereby they are hardened and encouraged in evil, like Felix. God's prophets were charged with being troublers of the land, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that he perverted the nation; the very same charges were brought against Paul. The selfish and evil passions of men urge them forward, and the graces and power of speech, too often have been used to mislead and prejudice men against the truth. How different will the characters of Paul and Felix appear at the day of judgement, from what they are represented in the speech of Tertullus! Let not Christians value the applause, or be troubled at the revilings of ungodly men, who represent the vilest of the human race almost as gods, and the excellent of the earth as pestilences and movers of sedition.</body></html>
