It is also a common medical term for the cessation or remission of pain or disease. St. Paul uses it four times in his Epistles for "rest" or "ease" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-13.htm">2 Corinthians 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>). Doubtless St. Luke was thus enabled to be much with St. Paul during his imprison merit, and, as suggested above, to have his help in writing his Gospel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:22-27 The apostle reasoned concerning the nature and obligations of righteousness, temperance, and of a judgment to come; thus showing the oppressive judge and his profligate mistress, their need of repentance, forgiveness, and of the grace of the gospel. Justice respects our conduct in life, particularly in reference to others; temperance, the state and government of our souls, in reference to God. He who does not exercise himself in these, has neither the form nor the power of godliness, and must be overwhelmed with the Divine wrath in the day of God's appearing. A prospect of the judgment to come, is enough to make the stoutest heart to tremble. Felix trembled, but that was all. Many are startled by the word of God, who are not changed by it. Many fear the consequences of sin, yet continue in the love and practice of sin. In the affairs of our souls, delays are dangerous. Felix put off this matter to a more convenient season, but we do not find that the more convenient season ever came. Behold now is the accepted time; hear the voice of the Lord to-day. He was in haste to turn from hearing the truth. Was any business more urgent than for him to reform his conduct, or more important than the salvation of his soul! Sinners often start up like a man roused from his sleep by a loud noise, but soon sink again into their usual drowsiness. Be not deceived by occasional appearances of religion in ourselves or in others. Above all, let us not trifle with the word of God. Do we expect that as we advance in life our hearts will grow softer, or that the influence of the world will decline? Are we not at this moment in danger of being lost for ever? Now is the day of salvation; tomorrow may be too late.</body></html>
