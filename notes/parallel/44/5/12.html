It was, we have seen, at all times a favourite place of resort for teachers. The chronology of this period of the history is still, as before, left somewhat indefinite; but assuming some months to have passed since the Day of Pentecost, what is now related would be in the winter, when, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-23.htm" title="And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.">John 10:23</a>, that portico, as facing the east and catching the morning sunlight, was more than usually frequented. On "with one accord," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-24.htm" title="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:">Acts 4:24</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the hands of the apostles,</span> etc. Two things are here remarkable. The one that Christianity at its beginnings was mightily helped and advanced by miracles done in the Name of Jesus Christ. The other that the authority of the apostles as the rulers of the Church was greatly strengthened by these miracles being wrought exclusively by their hands. We cannot understand either the external relations of the Church to the world, or the internal relations of the people to their spiritual rulers, unless we duly take count of these two things. <span class="cmt_word">With one accord</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-24.htm">Acts 4:24</a>, note). In Solomon's porch (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a>, note). It is quite true to nature that Solomon's porch, having been the scene of the miracle, became the place of frequent concourse. There is a difference of opinion among commentators as to whether the <span class="accented">all</span> refers to the whole Christian laity as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>, or to the apostles only. Alford thinks the latter, Meyer the former. The opinion that the whole body of Christians is meant seems most probable, both from the use of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. I and from the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> (especially in connection with <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), which seems more applicable to a mixed multitude than to twelve colleagues like the apostles. You could hardly say that all the queen's ministers met in a Cabinet Council with one accord. There is no need for the parenthesis as in the A.V. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-16 The separation of hypocrites by distinguishing judgments, should make the sincere cleave closer to each other and to the gospel ministry. Whatever tends to the purity and reputation of the church, promotes its enlargement; but that power alone which wrought such miracles by the apostles, can rescue sinners from the power of sin and Satan, and add believers to His worshippers. Christ will work by all his faithful servants; and every one who applies to him shall be healed.</body></html>
