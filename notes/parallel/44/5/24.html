For the <span class="accented">captain</span>, see above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm">Acts 4:1</a>, note). He was especially interested as being, probably, the officer who had arrested the apostles the day before. <span class="cmt_word">Were much perplexed concerning</span>. The verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>), which only occurs in the New Testament here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-12.htm">Acts 2:12, 10</a>:17, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7</a>, and (in the middle voice) <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>, means properly "to be in doubt which road to take," hence generally to be in doubt, perplexity. <span class="cmt_word">Them</span> may apply either to the <span class="accented">words</span>, the strange things just reported to them, or to the <span class="accented">apostles</span> about whom the things were reported. It seems most natural to refer it to the <span class="accented">words.</span> They were in doubt and perplexity as to what it would all grow to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 There is no prison so dark, so strong, but God can visit his people in it, and, if he pleases, fetch them out. Recoveries from sickness, releases out of trouble, are granted, not that we may enjoy the comforts of life, but that God may be honoured with the services of our life. It is not for the preachers of Christ's gospel to retire into corners, as long as they can have any opportunity of preaching in the great congregation. They must preach to the lowest, whose souls are as precious to Christ as the souls of the greatest. Speak to all, for all are concerned. Speak as those who resolve to stand to it, to live and die by it. Speak all the words of this heavenly, divine life, in comparison with which the present earthly life does not deserve the name. These words of life, which the Holy Ghost puts into your mouth. The words of the gospel are the words of life; words whereby we may be saved. How wretched are those who are vexed at the success of the gospel! They cannot but see that the word and power of the Lord are against them; and they tremble for the consequences, yet they will go on.</body></html>
