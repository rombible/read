(1) Annas lived to see five of his sons fill the office of high priest (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 9, ? 1); but his old age was overclouded by the tumults raised by the Zealots under John of Gischala, in the reign of Vespasian, and before he died the sanctuary was occupied by them, and became in very deed a "den of robbers" (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>iv. 3, ? 7). (2) Joseph, surnamed Caiaphas, his son-in-law, who owed his appointment to Gratus (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 2, ? 2), was deposed by the Proconsul Vitellius, A.D. 36 (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xviii.</span> 4, ? 3), and disappears from history. (3) On John and Alexander, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-6.htm" title="And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.">Acts 4:6</a>. (4) Gamaliel, who is not mentioned by Josephus, continued to preside over the Sanhedrin under Caligula and Claudius, and is said to have died eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem, and to have sanctioned the Anathema, or "Prayer against heretics," drawn up by Samuel the Little (Lightfoot, <span class= "ital">Cent. Chorograph, </span>c. 15). Christian traditions, however, represent him as having been secretly a disciple of Christ (Pseudo-Clement, <span class= "ital">Recogn.</span> i. 65), and to have been baptised by Peter and Paul, with Nicodemus, who is represented as his nephew, and his son Abibas (<span class= "ital">Photius Cod.</span> 171, p. 199). In a legendary story, purporting to come from a priest of Syria, named Lucian, accepted by Augustine, he appears as having buried Stephen and other Christians, and to have been buried himself in the same sepulchre with the Protomartyr and Nicodemus at Caphar-algama (August. <span class= "ital">de Civ. Dei</span> xvii. 8, Serm. 318). Later Rabbis looked on him as the last of the great Teachers or Rabbans, and noted that till his time men had taught the Law standing, while afterwards they sat. The glory of the Law, they said, had departed with Gamaliel.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="accented">Every</span> <span class="accented">day</span> for <span class="accented">daily</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">at home for in every hour</span>, A.V.

The meaning is that they daily preached Jesus Christ both in the temple and in the house or houses where the disciples were wont to meet (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, note). The spirit and conduct of the apostles here recorded is a precious example to their successors. To glory in the cross, to count shame endured for Christ's sake the highest honor, and to be unwearied and undaunted in teaching and preaching Jesus Christ through good report and through evil report, is the true character and work of every bishop of souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:34-42 The Lord still has all hearts in his hands, and sometimes directs the prudence of the worldly wise, so as to restrain the persecutors. Common sense tells us to be cautious, while experience and observation show that the success of frauds in matters of religion has been very short. Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us conformable to his pattern, and serviceable to his interest. They rejoiced in it. If we suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as we should, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enabled us so to do. The apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ. This was the preaching that most offended the priests. But it ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ: Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified; nothing beside this, but what has reference to it. And whatever is our station or rank in life, we should seek to make Him known, and to glorify his name.</body></html>
