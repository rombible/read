But in this case there was something more. The Twelve could not fail to remember their Lord's beatitudes; and now, for the first time, felt that they could "rejoice and be exceeding glad" because they were suffering as the prophets had suffered before them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11-12</a>). And they were suffering for His Name, or rather, with the best MSS., "for <span class= "ital">the</span> Name"--for that of the Master who had loved them and whom they had learnt to love. We may note, too, in the whole history, the fulfilment of the prediction and the promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-17.htm" title="But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues;">Matthew 10:17-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> <span class="accented">- They therefore</span> for <span class="accented">and they</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">dishonor for the Name</span>, for <span class="accented">shame</span> for <span class="accented">his</span> Name, A.V. and T.R.

Common sense tells us to be cautious, while experience and observation show that the success of frauds in matters of religion has been very short. Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us conformable to his pattern, and serviceable to his interest. They rejoiced in it. If we suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as we should, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enabled us so to do. The apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ. This was the preaching that most offended the priests. But it ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ: Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified; nothing beside this, but what has reference to it. And whatever is our station or rank in life, we should seek to make Him known, and to glorify his name.</body></html>
