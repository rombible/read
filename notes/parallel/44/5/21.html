Having (ver. 18) put the apostles in prison, they met the next morning to decide how to punish them. The council (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the Hebraeo-Greek, <span class="accented">the Sanhedrim</span>, the great council of the nation, consisting of seventy-two members, usually presided over by the high priest. It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55</a>, etc.; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-30.htm">Acts 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>, etc.; above <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-15.htm">Acts 4:15</a>).

But some (Schleusner, Heinrich, etc.) understand it as merely another phrase for the Sanhedrim, added for explanation and amplification. The council, of course, were ignorant of the escape of the prisoners. The prison-house (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); "prison" (A.V.) represents <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 There is no prison so dark, so strong, but God can visit his people in it, and, if he pleases, fetch them out. Recoveries from sickness, releases out of trouble, are granted, not that we may enjoy the comforts of life, but that God may be honoured with the services of our life. It is not for the preachers of Christ's gospel to retire into corners, as long as they can have any opportunity of preaching in the great congregation. They must preach to the lowest, whose souls are as precious to Christ as the souls of the greatest. Speak to all, for all are concerned. Speak as those who resolve to stand to it, to live and die by it. Speak all the words of this heavenly, divine life, in comparison with which the present earthly life does not deserve the name. These words of life, which the Holy Ghost puts into your mouth. The words of the gospel are the words of life; words whereby we may be saved. How wretched are those who are vexed at the success of the gospel! They cannot but see that the word and power of the Lord are against them; and they tremble for the consequences, yet they will go on.</body></html>
