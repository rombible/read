Assuming that miracles are possible, and that the narratives of the Gospels indicate generally the laws that govern them, there is nothing in the present narrative that is not in harmony with those laws. Christ healed sometimes directly by a word, without contact of any kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-13.htm" title="And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; and as you have believed, so be it done to you. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.">Matthew 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-52.htm" title="Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.">John 4:52</a>); sometimes through material <span class= "ital">media</span>--the fringe of His garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm" title="And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:">Matthew 9:20</a>), or the clay smeared over the blind man's eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-5.htm" title="As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.">John 9:5</a>) becoming channels through which the healing virtue passed. All that was wanted was the expectation of an intense faith, as the subjective condition on the one side, the presence of an objective supernatural power on the other, and any medium upon which the imagination might happen to fix itself as a help to faith. So afterwards the "hand, kerchiefs and aprons" from St. Paul's skin do what the shadow of St. Peter does here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>). In the use of oil, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-13.htm" title="And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.">Mark 6:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-14.htm" title="Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:">James 5:14</a>, we find a medium employed which had in itself a healing power, with which the prayer of faith was to co-operate.<p>On the "beds and couches," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-4.htm" title="And when they could not come near to him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.">Mark 2:4</a>.

Whatever tends to the purity and reputation of the church, promotes its enlargement; but that power alone which wrought such miracles by the apostles, can rescue sinners from the power of sin and Satan, and add believers to His worshippers. Christ will work by all his faithful servants; and every one who applies to him shall be healed.</body></html>
