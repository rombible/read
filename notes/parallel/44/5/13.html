Does it mean that the Apostles stood aloof in an isolated majesty, and so that none of the other disciples dared associate himself with them? or is this St. Luke's way of speaking of the Pharisees and other teachers, who also resorted to the portico, but, as in the days of our Lord's ministry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-48.htm" title="Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?">John 7:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>), had not the courage to attach themselves to those with whom they really sympathised? The latter view seems every way the more probable, 'and so the passage stands parallel with those which tell us how the people heard our Lord gladly and "came early to hear him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-38.htm" title="And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.">Luke 21:38</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">howbeit</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The rest</span> seems most naturally to mean those who were not included in the <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, viz. the Jews as distinguished from the disciples. The effect 'of the miracles was that the Jews looked with awe and reverence upon the Apostolic Church, and none durst join them from mere curiosity or with any idle purpose.

The word occurs in the New Testament ten times, of which seven are in St. Luke's Gospel or in the Acts. The other three are in St. Paul's Epistles (see for the use of it in the sense it has here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-15.htm">Luke 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-26.htm">Acts 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-34.htm">Acts 17:34</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-16 The separation of hypocrites by distinguishing judgments, should make the sincere cleave closer to each other and to the gospel ministry. Whatever tends to the purity and reputation of the church, promotes its enlargement; but that power alone which wrought such miracles by the apostles, can rescue sinners from the power of sin and Satan, and add believers to His worshippers. Christ will work by all his faithful servants; and every one who applies to him shall be healed.</body></html>
