The word was applied first by Jews to Christians, and then by Christians to sects (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jealousy</span> scarcely so well expresses the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here as <span class="accented">indignation</span> does. In the First Epistle of Clement, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is applied to the anger of Cain, of Joseph's brethren, of the Israelites against Moses, of the persecution of St. Peter and St. Paul (iv., 5.). It is only occasionally that it means that kind of anger which we call <span class="accented">jealousy.</span> The high priest and his party were indignant at the defiance of their authority, and at the success of the doctrine which they had made it a special object to put down. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 There is no prison so dark, so strong, but God can visit his people in it, and, if he pleases, fetch them out. Recoveries from sickness, releases out of trouble, are granted, not that we may enjoy the comforts of life, but that God may be honoured with the services of our life. It is not for the preachers of Christ's gospel to retire into corners, as long as they can have any opportunity of preaching in the great congregation. They must preach to the lowest, whose souls are as precious to Christ as the souls of the greatest. Speak to all, for all are concerned. Speak as those who resolve to stand to it, to live and die by it. Speak all the words of this heavenly, divine life, in comparison with which the present earthly life does not deserve the name. These words of life, which the Holy Ghost puts into your mouth. The words of the gospel are the words of life; words whereby we may be saved. How wretched are those who are vexed at the success of the gospel! They cannot but see that the word and power of the Lord are against them; and they tremble for the consequences, yet they will go on.</body></html>
