The part he now played in the opening of the great drama, and not less his position as the instructor of St. Paul, demand attention. We have to think of him as the grandson of the great Hillel the representative of the best school of Pharisaism, the tolerant and large-hearted rival of the narrow and fanatic Shammai, whose precepts--such, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>as, Do nothing to another which thou wouldest not that he should do to thee--remind us of the Sermon on the Mount. The fame of Hillel won for him the highest honour of Judaism: the title of <span class= "ital">R</span>abban (the <span class= "ital">Rabboni</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-51.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, What will you that I should do to you? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.">Mark 10:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-16.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned herself, and said to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.">John 20:16</a>), and the office of President of the Council. For the first time, there seemed likely to be a dynasty of scribes, and the office of chief of the Jewish schools, what we might almost call their Professorship of Theology, was transmitted through four generations. Hillel was succeeded by his son Simeon, whom some have identified with the Simeon of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a> (see Note there), and he by Gamaliel. He, too, was known as the Rabban, and he rose now, with all the weight of years and authority, to counsel moderation. Various motives may have influenced him. He was old enough to remember the wisdom and grace of the child Jesus when, twenty-eight years before, He had sat in the midst of the doctors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-46.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.">Luke 2:46</a>). He may have welcomed, during our Lord's ministry, the teaching with so much of which Hillel would have sympathised, and been as the scribe who was not far from the kingdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/12-32.htm" title="And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:">Mark 12:32-34</a>), rejoicing in the new proof that had been brought forward of the doctrine of the Resurrection. As being himself of the house and lineage of David, he may have sympathised with the claims of One who was welcomed as the Son of David. One who was so prominent as a teacher could not fail to be acquainted with a brother-teacher like Nicodemus, and may well have been influenced by the example of his gradual conversion and the counsels of caution which he had given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-50.htm" title="Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)">John 7:50-51</a>). The tone in which he speaks now might almost lead us to class him with the "many" of the chief rulers who secretly believed in Christ, but shrank from confessing Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42-43</a>). It seems probable that he, like Joseph of Arimathaea, had "not consented to the counsel and deed" of the Sanhedrin which Caiaphas had hastily convened for our Lord's trial, and had contented himself with a policy of absence and expectation. If, as seems probable, Saul of Tarsus was at this time one of his disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm" title="I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.">Acts 22:3</a>), the words of warning, though addressed generally to the Council, may well have been intended specially to restrain his fiery and impetuous zeal.<p><span class= "bld">Commanded to put the apostles forth a little space.</span>--The practice of thus deliberating in the absence of the accused seems to have been common. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-15.htm" title="But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,">Acts 4:15</a>.) The report of the speech that follows may have come to St. Luke from some member of the Council, or, probably enough, from St. Paul himself. The occasional coincidences of language with the writings of that Apostle tend to confirm the antecedent likelihood of the conjecture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- But there</span> for <span class="accented">there</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in honor of</span> for <span class="accented">in reputation among</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the men</span> for <span class="accented">the apostles</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">while</span> for <span class="accented">space</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A Pharisee named Gamaliel</span>. St. Luke had mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm">Acts 4:1</a> and Acts 5:17) that there was an influential party of Sadducees in the Sanhedrim. He, therefore, now specially notes that Gamaliel was a Pharisee. There can be no doubt that this alone would rather dispose him to resist the violent counsels of the Sadducean members, and the more so as the doctrine of the Resurrection was in question (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6-8</a>). Moreover, Gamaliel was noted for his moderation. That <span class="accented">Gamaliel</span> here named is the same as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>, at whose feet St. Paul was brought up at Jerusalem, and who is known in the Talmud as Rabban Gamaliel the elder (to distinguish him from his grandson of the same name, the younger), the grandson of Hillel, the head of the school of Hillel, and at some time president of the Sanhedrim, one of the most famous of the Jewish doctors (as the title <span class="accented">Rabban</span>, borne by only six others, shows), seems certain, though it cannot absolutely be proved. The description of him as <span class="cmt_word">a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people;</span> the allusion to him as a great teacher, learned in the perfect manner of the Law of the fathers, and one whose greatness would be as a shield to his pupils, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>; the exact chronological agreement; the weight he possessed in the Sanhedrim, in spite of the Sadducean tendencies of the high priest and his followers; and the agreement between his character as written in the Talmud and as shown in his speech and in the counsel given in it, seem to place his identity beyond all reasonable doubt. There does not seem to be any foundation for the legend in the Clementine Recognitions, that he was in secret a Christian. If the prayer used in the synagogues, "Let there be no hope to them that apostatize from the true religion; and let heretics, how many soever they he, all perish as in a moment," be really his composition, as the Jews say, he certainly had no inclination to Christianity ('Prid. Conn.,' 1:361). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:34-42 The Lord still has all hearts in his hands, and sometimes directs the prudence of the worldly wise, so as to restrain the persecutors. Common sense tells us to be cautious, while experience and observation show that the success of frauds in matters of religion has been very short. Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us conformable to his pattern, and serviceable to his interest. They rejoiced in it. If we suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as we should, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enabled us so to do. The apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ. This was the preaching that most offended the priests. But it ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ: Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified; nothing beside this, but what has reference to it. And whatever is our station or rank in life, we should seek to make Him known, and to glorify his name.</body></html>
