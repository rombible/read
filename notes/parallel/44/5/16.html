It is obvious here also that we have the summary of what must have occupied, at least, several months.<p><span class= "bld">Vexed with unclean spirits.</span>--In this work the Apostles and the Seventy had already experienced the power of the Name of the Lord Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.">Luke 10:17</a>). Now that they were working in the full power of the Spirit, it was natural that they should do yet greater things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-12.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father.">John 14:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- And there also came together the multitude from</span> for <span class="accented">there came also a multitude out of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">about Jerusalem</span> for <span class="accented">about unto Jerusalem</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">folk</span> for <span class="accented">folks</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that were</span> for <span class="accented">which were</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">And there also came together</span>, etc. One great result of these numerous miracles would be to manifest that the Lord Jesus was still with his Church as truly as when he was upon the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>), and this manifestation remains for the comfort of his people, even now that such miracles have ceased. With regard to what is said in ver. 15 of the shadow of Peter being thought to have had a healing power, it may have been true that it had, as Christ could heal by a shadow as well as by a word or touch, but we cannot say for certain that it was so; anyhow, it was a marvelous season of refreshing to the Church, preparing her for the coming trial. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:12-16 The separation of hypocrites by distinguishing judgments, should make the sincere cleave closer to each other and to the gospel ministry. Whatever tends to the purity and reputation of the church, promotes its enlargement; but that power alone which wrought such miracles by the apostles, can rescue sinners from the power of sin and Satan, and add believers to His worshippers. Christ will work by all his faithful servants; and every one who applies to him shall be healed.</body></html>
