It had the same significance as John, or Johanan, "The Lord be gracious." "Sapphira," is either connected with the "sapphire," as a precious stone, or from a Hebrew word signifying "beautiful" or "pleasant." The whole history must be read in connection with the act of Barnabas. He, it seemed, had gained praise and power by his self-sacrifice. Ananias thought that he could get at the same result more cheaply. The act shows a strange mingling of discordant elements. Zeal and faith of some sort had led him to profess himself a believer. Ambition was strong enough to win a partial victory over avarice; avarice was strong enough to triumph over truth. The impulse to sell came from the Spirit of God; it was counteracted by the spirit of evil, and the resulting sin was therefore worse than that of one who lived altogether in the lower, commoner forms of covetousness. It was an attempt to serve God and mammon; to gain the reputation of a saint, without the reality of holiness. The sin of Ananias is, in some aspects, like that of Gehazi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/5-20.htm" title="But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.">2Kings 5:20-27</a>), but it was against greater light and intensified by a more profound hypocrisy, and it was therefore visited by a more terrible chastisement. We may well trace in the earnestness with which St. James warns men against the peril of the "double mind"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the heart divided between the world and God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-8.htm" title="A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.">James 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-8.htm" title="Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded.">James 4:8</a>)--the impression made on him by such a history as this.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ananias</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-23.htm">Nehemiah 3:23</a> the Hebrew name <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (God covers or protects) is thus rendered in the LXX. But the name occurs nowhere else.

Ananias (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), and is doubtless the name meant here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Sapphira</span> does not occur elsewhere. It is either derived from the Aramean <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, beautiful, or from the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, a sapphire. <span class="cmt_word">A possession</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-45.htm">Acts 2:45</a>). The kind of possession is not specified by the word itself, which applies to houses, fields, jewels, and wealth generally; but the nature of the property is shown by the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, applied to it in vers. 3 and 8, which means especially" a parcel of ground" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>), "a field" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18, 19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-11 The sin of Ananias and Sapphira was, that they were ambitious of being thought eminent disciples, when they were not true disciples. Hypocrites may deny themselves, may forego their worldly advantage in one instance, with a prospect of finding their account in something else. They were covetous of the wealth of the world, and distrustful of God and his providence. They thought they might serve both God and mammon. They thought to deceive the apostles. The Spirit of God in Peter discerned the principle of unbelief reigning in the heart of Ananias. But whatever Satan might suggest, he could not have filled the heart of Ananias with this wickedness had he not been consenting. The falsehood was an attempt to deceive the Spirit of truth, who so manifestly spoke and acted by the apostles. The crime of Ananias was not his retaining part of the price of the land; he might have kept it all, had he pleased; but his endeavouring to impose upon the apostles with an awful lie, from a desire to make a vain show, joined with covetousness. But if we think to put a cheat upon God, we shall put a fatal cheat upon our own souls. How sad to see those relations who should quicken one another to that which is good, hardening one another in that which is evil! And this punishment was in reality mercy to vast numbers. It would cause strict self-examination, prayer, and dread of hypocrisy, covetousness, and vain-glory, and it should still do so. It would prevent the increase of false professors. Let us learn hence how hateful falsehood is to the God of truth, and not only shun a direct lie, but all advantages from the use of doubtful expressions, and double meaning in our speech.</body></html>
