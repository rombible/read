It implies the kind of assistance which one friend or ally gives to another of inferior power. It is found in the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/13-18.htm" title="For health he calleth upon that which is weak: for life prayeth to that which is dead; for aid humbly beseecheth that which hath least means to help: and for a good journey he asketh of that which cannot set a foot forward:">Wisdom Of Solomon 13:18</a>.

Some MSS., however, have "witnessed to by small and great;" but this, besides the want of authority, and its involving an unusual construction, is at variance with the context. It was true that St. Paul's life was spent in bearing witness that Jesus was Christ. It was not true that he had a good report of all men. The words "small and <span class= "ital">great"</span> were significant as spoken when he was standing before two men like Festus and Agrippa. The phrase may be noted as occurring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-10.htm" title="To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.">Acts 8:10</a>, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm" title="And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.">Revelation 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-16.htm" title="And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:">Revelation 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-5.htm" title="And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you his servants, and you that fear him, both small and great.">Revelation 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-18.htm" title="That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.">Revelation 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The prophets and Moses.</span>--The more natural order of "Moses and the prophets" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-29.htm" title="Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.">Luke 16:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-31.htm" title="And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.">Luke 16:31</a>), and the order of the words in the Greek, <span class= "ital">which the</span> <span class= "ital">prophets said should come, and Moses, </span>suggests the thought that the sentence would have stopped naturally at "come," and that the name of Moses was added by an instantaneous after-thought to meet the case of those among the hearers who, like the Sadducees, placed the Pentateuch on a higher level of authority than the Prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- The help that is from God</span> for <span class="accented">help of God</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">stand</span> for <span class="accented">continue</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">testifying</span> for <span class="accented">witnessing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">nothing but what</span> for <span class="accented">none other things than those which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Help</span>, etc.; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, here only and in Wisd. 13:18, still of Divine help; in medical writers frequently, of aid from medicine and physicians; common also in classical writers, of auxiliary forces.

He was made a minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him in that glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, who are yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned, but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makes way for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints in heaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved by faith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; by this we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise from the dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by the prophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeased at? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a good account of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and calling on men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have been blamed and persecuted.</body></html>
