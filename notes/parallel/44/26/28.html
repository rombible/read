The words run literally, <span class= "ital">In, </span>or <span class= "ital">with, a little thou persuadest me;</span> and this may be completed by, "with little <span class= "ital">speech,"</span> "with little <span class= "ital">labour,"</span> or "little <span class= "ital">evidence.</span>" So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a> we have precisely the same phrase rendered "in few <span class= "ital">words."</span> Agrippa's words, accordingly, are the expression, not of a half-belief, but of a cynical sneer. <span class= "ital">Thou art trying to make a Christian of me with very few words, on very slender grounds, </span>would be the nearest paraphrase of his derisive answer to St. Paul's appeal. It was. it will be seen, evasive as well as derisive; he shrinks from a direct answer to the question that had been put to him. In his use of the Latin term "Christian" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>) we may trace, perhaps, the effect of Roman associations. There certainly were Christian communities at Rome at this time (Romans 16 <span class= "ital">passim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and they would naturally be described there as they had been at Antioch. It may be noted that, of the prominent English versions, Wiclif gives "in a little thing," Tyndal and Cranmer "somewhat," the Rhemish "a little;" the Geneva agrees with the present version in "almost." The meaning "somewhat," or "a little," is a tenable one. but <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a>. as already stated, is in favour of that given above. The phrase was, perhaps, in itself ambiguous, and St. Paul accepts in one sense what had been spoken in another.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">with but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian</span> for <span class="accented">almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">With but little persuasion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>.). This saying of Agrippa's is obscure and variously explained. The A.V., following Chrysostom, Beza, Luther, etc., takes <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> to mean "within a little" or" almost," like the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>, which is very suitable to the context. The corresponding <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, or, as otherwise read, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> would then mean, as in the A.V., "altogether," and the sense of the whole passage is striking and appropriate. But there is some difficulty in getting Otis meaning out of the words. The natural way of expressing it would be <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>. Hence many other commentators take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> to mean "in a short time," and the sense to be either "you are making short work of my conversion: you are persuading me to become a Christian as suddenly as you yourself did;" with a corresponding sense for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, "in a long time," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether it takes a short or a long time, I pray God you may become a Christian like myself;" or, "you are soon persuading me," you will soon persuade me if you go on any longer in this strain. Others, again, preferring the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> in ver. 29, take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> to mean "with little trouble," or "with few words," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a> (understanding <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), "lightly" (Alford), and then the opposite <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> would mean "with much trouble," "with many words," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "with difficulty." But this is rather a fiat rendering. Another difference of opinion is whether the words of Agrippa are to be taken ironically, or sarcastically, or jestingly, or whether they are to be taken seriously, as the words of a man shaken in his convictions and seriously impressed by what he had heard. The whole turn of the narrative seems to favor the latter view. Another view, started by Chrysostom, is that Agrippa used the words in one sense, and St. Paul (mistakenly or advisedly) took them in another. Another possible explanation is that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> is here used in the sense in which Thucydides employs the phrase (it. 86 and Ephesians 4:26), <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, viz. "in a narrow place;" and that Agrippa meant to say, "By your appeal to the prophets you press me hard; you have got me into a corner. I am in a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, a ' narrow room; ' I hardly know how to get out of it." The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> would then mean a" large room," a <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<span class="accented"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30.htm">Psalm 30</a>:</span>8). This would suppose <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> to have become proverbial phrases. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:24-32 It becomes us, on all occasions, to speak the words of truth and soberness, and then we need not be troubled at the unjust censures of men. Active and laborious followers of the gospel often have been despised as dreamers or madmen, for believing such doctrines and such wonderful facts; and for attesting that the same faith and diligence, and an experience like their own, are necessary to all men, whatever their rank, in order to their salvation. But apostles and prophets, and the Son of God himself, were exposed to this charge; and none need be moved thereby, when Divine grace has made them wise unto salvation. Agrippa saw a great deal of reason for Christianity. His understanding and judgment were for the time convinced, but his heart was not changed. And his conduct and temper were widely different from the humility and spirituality of the gospel. Many are almost persuaded to be religious, who are not quite persuaded; they are under strong convictions of their duty, and of the excellence of the ways of God, yet do not pursue their convictions. Paul urged that it was the concern of every one to become a true Christian; that there is grace enough in Christ for all. He expressed his full conviction of the truth of the gospel, the absolute necessity of faith in Christ in order to salvation. Such salvation from such bondage, the gospel of Christ offers to the Gentiles; to a lost world. Yet it is with much difficulty that any person can be persuaded he needs a work of grace on his heart, like that which was needful for the conversion of the Gentiles. Let us beware of fatal hesitation in our own conduct; and recollect how far the being almost persuaded to be a Christian, is from being altogether such a one as every true believer is.</body></html>
