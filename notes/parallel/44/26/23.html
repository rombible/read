It was not till they were led, after the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, into our Lord's own school of prophetic interpretation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44</a>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and taught to recognise the under-current of types and prophecies that pointed to a righteous Sufferer, as well as to a righteous King, that they were able to receive the truth. So it was that a "Christ crucified" was still "to the Jews a stumbling-block" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1Corinthians 1:23</a>). The speech at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-27.htm" title="For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.">Acts 13:27-35</a>) may be noted as showing the stress which St. Paul laid on this point. The Greek has "if" in both clauses where the English has "that;" but our idiom scarcely admits of its being so translated.<p><span class= "bld">That he should be the first that should rise from the dead.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">that He first by His</span> <span class= "ital">resurrection from the dead</span> (strictly, <span class= "ital">out of His resurrection</span>) <span class= "ital">should show light.</span> It was through the Resurrection only that the hopes of Simeon were fulfilled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-32.htm" title="A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.">Luke 2:32</a>), and that light shone in on those who had been sitting as in the shadow of death. The "people" are, as almost always when the word is so used, God's people Israel, as distinguished from the heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- How that the Christ must</span> for <span class="accented">that Christ should</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim</span> for <span class="accented">that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">both to</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">How that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>); see ver. 8, note. <span class="cmt_word">Must suffer</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> only here and in profane Greek writers. The exact meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is "liable to suffering," just as <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (from <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>) means "liable to death," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> mortal. But just as <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in use comes to mean "one who must die," so <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> means "one who must suffer;" and so we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; "Ought not Christ to have suffered," etc.? And so again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-46.htm">Luke 24:46</a> (T.R.), <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "It behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead," where the turn of thought is exactly the same as here. The Vulgate renders it by <span class="accented">passibilis.</span> The Fathers (Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr) contrast the state of Christ in glory with his state in the flesh by the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "impassible" and "passible." <span class="cmt_word">That he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim</span>, etc. Most commentators, from Chrysostom downwards, connect the first with the resurrection. "First from the resurrection," equal to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>). As Meyer truly says, "The chief stress of this sentence lies on <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>." The A.V. gives the sense by a periphrasis; only it must be well understood that it was especially by being the first to rise, and so to bring life and immortality to light, that Christ showed light to the people. The words may, of course, be construed as the R.V. does, but such a rendering is not in accordance with the spirit of the passage or the analogy of other passages. Christ was the first rise, and he will be followed by them that are his. But it is not true to say that he was the first to give light to Jews and Gentiles, and will be followed by others doing the same. (For the sentiment, setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>.) Note on the whole the enormous stress laid by St. Paul on the fulfillment of prophecy as a proof of the truth of the gospel, following therein our Lord himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25, 27, 44, 45</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:12-23 Paul was made a Christian by Divine power; by a revelation of Christ both to him and in him; when in the full career of his sin. He was made a minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him in that glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, who are yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned, but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makes way for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints in heaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved by faith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; by this we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise from the dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by the prophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeased at? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a good account of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and calling on men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have been blamed and persecuted.</body></html>
