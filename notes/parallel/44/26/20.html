This does not allude to any preaching in the land of Judaea at the time of his first visit to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>), because he says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>, that at <span class="accented">that time</span>, viz. before he went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, he was still "<span class="accented">unknown</span> by face unto the Churches of Judaea." But he had opportunities later of preaching in Judaea. For instance, the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a> suggests that such an opportunity may have arisen when Paul and Barnabas carried up the alms of the Christians at Antioch "unto the brethren that dwelt in Judaea." Another opportunity he manifestly had when he passed with Barnabas through Phoenicia and Samaria to Jerusalem, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>. Another, when he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>. Again, there was room for working among the Jews in Palestine while he was staying at Caesarea "many days," and journeying to Jerusalem, as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10, 15</a>. So that there is no contradiction whatever between the statement in this verse and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>. The clauses in this verse are two: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "both to them at Damascus, and at Jerusalem first;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "and throughout all Judaea, and to the Gentiles." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:12-23 Paul was made a Christian by Divine power; by a revelation of Christ both to him and in him; when in the full career of his sin. He was made a minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him in that glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, who are yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned, but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makes way for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints in heaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved by faith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; by this we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise from the dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by the prophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeased at? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a good account of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and calling on men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have been blamed and persecuted.</body></html>
