Grammatically the words admit of three possible paraphrases, each of which has found advocates. We may suppose St. Paul to say--(1) "I would pray to God, not as you put it, lightly, but as fully as I can . . . .;" or (2) "I would pray to God that, whether persuaded with little evidence or much . . . .;" or (3) "I would pray to God that, both in a little measure and in a great. . . ." The first two of these explanations are open to the objection that they substitute a disjunctive alternative for the natural rendering of the two copulative conjunctions. The last has the advantage of so far taking the words in their natural construction; but, on the other hand, it takes the special phrase, "in a little," in a sense different from that in which we have seen reason to believe that Agrippa had used it. It is, however, perfectly conceivable that, for the purpose of emphasising the strong desire of his heart, St. Paul may have caught up the half-sarcastic phrase, and used it as with a new meaning.<p>The MSS. present two readings, <span class= "ital">in a little and in a great, </span>and <span class= "ital">in a little and in much;</span> but this scarcely affects the interpretation of the passage.<p><span class= "bld">Except these bonds.</span>--The words show, as has been pointed out in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-29.htm" title="And Paul said, I would to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.">Acts 26:29</a>, that the prisoner was brought into court chained, after the Roman fashion, to the soldier or soldiers who kept guard over him. We cannot read the words without feeling their almost plaintive pathos. "Such as he"--pardoned, at peace with God and man, with a hope stretching beyond the grave, and an actual present participation in the powers of the eternal world--this is what he was desiring for them. If that could be effected, he would be content to remain in his bonds, and to leave them upon their thrones.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="accented">Whether with little or with much</span> for <span class="accented">both almost, and altogether</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">might become</span> for <span class="accented">were</span>, A.V.

Active and laborious followers of the gospel often have been despised as dreamers or madmen, for believing such doctrines and such wonderful facts; and for attesting that the same faith and diligence, and an experience like their own, are necessary to all men, whatever their rank, in order to their salvation. But apostles and prophets, and the Son of God himself, were exposed to this charge; and none need be moved thereby, when Divine grace has made them wise unto salvation. Agrippa saw a great deal of reason for Christianity. His understanding and judgment were for the time convinced, but his heart was not changed. And his conduct and temper were widely different from the humility and spirituality of the gospel. Many are almost persuaded to be religious, who are not quite persuaded; they are under strong convictions of their duty, and of the excellence of the ways of God, yet do not pursue their convictions. Paul urged that it was the concern of every one to become a true Christian; that there is grace enough in Christ for all. He expressed his full conviction of the truth of the gospel, the absolute necessity of faith in Christ in order to salvation. Such salvation from such bondage, the gospel of Christ offers to the Gentiles; to a lost world. Yet it is with much difficulty that any person can be persuaded he needs a work of grace on his heart, like that which was needful for the conversion of the Gentiles. Let us beware of fatal hesitation in our own conduct; and recollect how far the being almost persuaded to be a Christian, is from being altogether such a one as every true believer is.</body></html>
