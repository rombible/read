The distinction between "the people," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Israel, as emphatically entitled to that name, and "nations," the "Gentiles," should be noted. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-25.htm" title="Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?">Acts 4:25</a>.) The relative "whom" probably refers to the latter of the two nouns rather than to both. In the Greek word for "send" (<span class= "ital">apostello</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>we find the warrant for St. Paul's claim to be considered an Apostle "not of men, neither by man," but by the direct personal call of the Lord Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>). The word that had been used of the Twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>) was used also of him; and the pronoun "<span class= "ital">I</span>" is specially emphasised.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Unto whom</span> for <span class="accented">unto whom</span> note, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Unto [the Gentiles]</span>. These seem to be the words heard in the trance reported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>, the sequel to which, as contained in ver. 18, the apostle would then have recited, had he not been cut short by the furious cries of the Jews. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:12-23 Paul was made a Christian by Divine power; by a revelation of Christ both to him and in him; when in the full career of his sin. He was made a minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him in that glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, who are yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned, but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makes way for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints in heaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved by faith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; by this we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise from the dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by the prophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeased at? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a good account of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and calling on men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have been blamed and persecuted.</body></html>
