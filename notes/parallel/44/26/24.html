That one who had been crucified should rise from the dead and give light to the Gentiles seemed to him the very hallucination of insanity. So have men at all times thought of those who lived after a higher law than their own, whether their faith rested, as in St. Paul's case, on an outward objective fact, or, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-4.htm" title="We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honour:">Wisdom Of Solomon 5:4</a>, on a true faith in the Unseen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- Made his</span> defense for <span class="accented">spake for himself</span>, A.V.

The excited interruption by Festus shows that he was unable to accept the truths enunciated by the apostle. The ideas of fulfilled prophecy, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of a crucified Jew giving light to the great Roman world, were" foolishness unto him," because he lacked spiritual discernment. He thought the apostle's glowing words must be the outcome of a disordered mind. <span class="cmt_word">Turn thee to madness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>).

Active and laborious followers of the gospel often have been despised as dreamers or madmen, for believing such doctrines and such wonderful facts; and for attesting that the same faith and diligence, and an experience like their own, are necessary to all men, whatever their rank, in order to their salvation. But apostles and prophets, and the Son of God himself, were exposed to this charge; and none need be moved thereby, when Divine grace has made them wise unto salvation. Agrippa saw a great deal of reason for Christianity. His understanding and judgment were for the time convinced, but his heart was not changed. And his conduct and temper were widely different from the humility and spirituality of the gospel. Many are almost persuaded to be religious, who are not quite persuaded; they are under strong convictions of their duty, and of the excellence of the ways of God, yet do not pursue their convictions. Paul urged that it was the concern of every one to become a true Christian; that there is grace enough in Christ for all. He expressed his full conviction of the truth of the gospel, the absolute necessity of faith in Christ in order to salvation. Such salvation from such bondage, the gospel of Christ offers to the Gentiles; to a lost world. Yet it is with much difficulty that any person can be persuaded he needs a work of grace on his heart, like that which was needful for the conversion of the Gentiles. Let us beware of fatal hesitation in our own conduct; and recollect how far the being almost persuaded to be a Christian, is from being altogether such a one as every true believer is.</body></html>
