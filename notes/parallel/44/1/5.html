The words threw the disciples back upon their recollection of their first admission to the Kingdom. Some of them, at least, must have remembered also the teaching which had told them of the new birth of water and of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3-5</a>). Now they were told that their spirits were to be as fully baptised, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>plunged, into the power of the Divine Spirit, as their bodies had then been plunged in the waters of the Jordan. And this was to be "not many days hence." The time was left undefined, as a discipline to their faith and patience. They were told that it would not be long, lest faith and patience should fail.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Indeed</span> for <span class="accented">truly</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall be baptized</span>, etc. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-16.htm">Luke 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>.) St. Peter refers to this saying of the Lord's in his address to the Church of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-16.htm">Acts 11:16</a>), and the record of it here may be an indication that St. Luke derived his information of these early events from Peter. A curious question arises as to the baptism of the apostles themselves. When were they baptized, and by whom? Chrysostom says, "They were baptized by John." But it is evident, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 2</a>, that converts were baptized with Christian, as distinct from John's, baptism in our Lord's lifetime, and hence it may seem probable, especially considering that St. Paul was baptized, that the apostles may have been baptized by Christ (Bishop Wordsworth On <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a>). If so, the baptism with the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was the complement of that baptism, not the substitute for it. "In our case," says Chrysostom, "both (the baptism of water and of the Spirit) take place under one act, but then they were divided." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Our Lord told the disciples the work they were to do. The apostles met together at Jerusalem; Christ having ordered them not to depart thence, but to wait for the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. This would be a baptism by the Holy Ghost, giving them power to work miracles, and enlightening and sanctifying their souls. This confirms the Divine promise, and encourages us to depend upon it, that we have heard it from Christ; for in Him all the promises of God are yea and amen.</body></html>
