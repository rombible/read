The construction is not free from ambiguity, and some interpreters have referred the words to the disciple about to be chosen, "to go to his own place" in the company of the Twelve. If we connect them, as seems most natural, with Judas, we find in them the kind of reserve natural in one that could neither bring himself to cherish hope nor venture to pronounce the condemnation which belonged to the Searcher of hearts. All that had been revealed to him was, that "it had been good for that man if he had not been born" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-21.htm" title="The Son of man indeed goes, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.">Mark 14:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> <span class="accented">- To take the place in this</span> for <span class="accented">that he matt take part of this</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">fell away</span> for <span class="accented">by transgression fell</span>, A.V.

The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be committed to us.</body></html>
