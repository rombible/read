This may, perhaps, account for the variations in the list just noticed. The women were less likely than the disciples to lay stress on what we may call the accurate coupling of the Twelve. The mention of "the women" as a definite body is characteristic of St. Luke as the only Evangelist who names them. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-49.htm" title="And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.">Luke 23:49</a>.) We may reasonably think of the company as including Mary Magdalene, Salome, Susanna, Joanna, Mary and Martha of Bethany, possibly also the woman that had been a sinner, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a>. Here we lose sight of them, and all that follows is conjectural. It is probable that they continued to share the work and the sufferings of the growing Church at Jerusalem, living together, perhaps at Bethany, in a kind of sisterhood. The persecution headed by Saul was likely to disperse them for a time, and some may well have been among the "women" who suffered in it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm" title="As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.">Acts 8:3</a>); but they may have returned when it ceased. St. Luke, when he came to Palestine, would seem to have met with one or more of them.<p><span class= "bld">Mary the mother of Jesus.</span>--Brief as the record is, it has the interest of giving the last known fact, as distinct from legend or tradition, in the life of the mother of our Lord. St. John, we know, had taken her to his own home, probably to a private dwelling in Jerusalem (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-27.htm" title="Then said he to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.">John 19:27</a>), and she had now come with him to the first meeting of the <span class= "ital">Ecclesia.</span> Here also we trace the influence of the women as St. Luke's informants. They could not have left unnoticed the presence of her who was the centre of their group. The legends of some apocryphal books represent her as staying at Jerusalem with St. John till her death, twenty-two years after the Ascension; while others represent her as going with him to Ephesus and dying there; the Apostles gather around her death-bed; she is buried, and the next day the grave is found emptied, and sweet flowers have grown around it; Mary also had been taken up into heaven. The festival of the Assumption, which owes its origin to this legend, dates from the sixth or seventh century.<p><span class= "bld">With his brethren.</span>--The last mention of the "brethren" had shown them as still unbelieving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-5.htm" title="For neither did his brothers believe in him.">John 7:5</a>). Various explanations of their change may be given. (1) They may have been drawn to believe before the Crucifixion by the great miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus. (2) The risen Lord had appeared to James as well as to the Apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-7.htm" title="After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.">1Corinthians 15:7</a>), and that may have fixed him and the other brothers in steadfast faith. (3) If the mother of Jesus was with John, the brethren also were likely to come, in greater or less measure, under the influence of their cousin. It may be noted that the brethren are here emphatically distinguished from the Apostles, and therefore that James the son of Aiphaeus cannot rightly be identified with James the Lord's brother. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- With one accord continued steadfastly</span> for <span class="accented">continued with one accord</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">prayer</span> for <span class="accented">prayer and supplication</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">The women</span>. St. Luke, in his Gospel, makes frequent mention of the women who followed our Lord, and generally of things that happened to women (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-27.htm">Luke 23:27, 49, 55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm">Luke 24:10, 22</a>, etc. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a>, etc.; Luke 8:23; 10:38, 42; etc.). We notice the same tendency in the Acts, here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-14.htm">Acts 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-13.htm">Acts 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-23.htm">Acts 25:23</a>; etc. <span class="cmt_word">Mary the mother of Jesus</span> appears here not as an object of worship, but as humbly joining in the prayers of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">And with his brethren</span>. The Lord's brethren are spoken of by name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a> as "James, and Joses ['Joseph,' R.V.], and Simon, and Judas." So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a> (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31-35</a>). "James the Lord's brother" is mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>); "the brethren of the Lord "are mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 5, 10</a>, "the brethren of Jesus" are spoken cf. This is not the place to enter upon the difficult question of their parentage. But it may suffice to say that if James and Judas are the two apostles of that name (which Alford, however, thinks they certainly were not, referring- to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>, compared with John 6:67), then the brethren here spoken of as distinct from the apostles would be Joses and Simon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-14 God can find hiding-places for his people. They made supplication. All God's people are praying people. It was now a time of trouble and danger with the disciples of Christ; but if any is afflicted, let him pray; that will silence cares and fears. They had now a great work to do, and before they entered upon it, they were earnest in prayer to God for his presence. They were waiting for the descent of the Spirit, and abounded in prayer. Those are in the best frame to receive spiritual blessings, who are in a praying frame. Christ had promised shortly to send the Holy Ghost; that promise was not to do away prayer, but to quicken and encourage it. A little company united in love, exemplary in their conduct, fervent in prayer, and wisely zealous to promote the cause of Christ, are likely to increase rapidly.</body></html>
