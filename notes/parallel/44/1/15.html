The use of "names" may be merely as a synonym for "persons," but It suggests the idea of there having been a list from which St. Luke extracted those that seemed most conspicuous.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - These for <span class="accented">those</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">brethren</span> for <span class="accented">disciples</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and there was a multitude of persons gathered together</span> for <span class="accented">the number of names together were</span>, A.V.; a for <span class="accented">an</span>, A.V.

The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be committed to us.</body></html>
