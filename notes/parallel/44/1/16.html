The tone of St. Peter's speech is that of one who felt that his offence had been fully forgiven, and that he was now restored by the charge given him, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/21-15.htm" title="So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.">John 21:15-17</a>, to his former position as guide and leader of the other disciples. To do that work faithfully was a worthier fruit of repentance than any public confession of his guilt would have been. This, of course, does not exclude--what is in itself probable--that he had previously confessed his fault, either to his special friend St. John, or to the whole company of Apostles and other disciples.<p><span class= "bld">Which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake . . .</span>--We have here, obviously, the firstfruits of the new method of interpretation in which the Apostles had been instructed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm" title="And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.">Luke 24:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-45.htm" title="Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,">Luke 24:45</a>). They had already been taught that the Holy Spirit which their Lord had promised to them had before spoken by the prophets. The recurrence of the same mode of speech in the "holy men of God who spake as they were moved (literally, <span class= "ital">borne along</span>) by the Holy Ghost," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>, is, as far as it goes, evidence in favour of the genuineness of that Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">Which was guide to them that took Jesus.</span>--The actual word "guide" is not found in the Gospel narrative, but it appears as a fact in all four, notably in that of St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-2.htm" title="And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.">John 18:2-3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- Brethren, it teas needful that the Scripture should be fulfilled</span> for <span class="accented">men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">spake before by the mouth of David</span> for <span class="accented">by the mouth of David spake before</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">It was needful</span>, etc. So our Lord declared, "The Scriptures cannot be broken" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>); and "All things must be fulfilled which were written" ere. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25-27, 44-46</a>). It is most important to our Christian integrity that we should view the Scriptures in the same light as our Lord and his apostles did, as containing real prophecies, spoken by the Holy Ghost. (Compare the manner in which the sixty-ninth psalm is here quoted with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7</a>.) So the Creed, "I believe in the Holy Ghost .... who spake by the prophets" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-25.htm">Acts 28:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who was guide</span>, etc. If St. Peter had only been addressing his brother apostles, who were well acquainted with the treachery of Judas, it would scarcely have been natural to introduce these words; they would have seemed rather to be explanatory words added by the historian. But the circumstances might be very imperfectly known to many of the hundred and twenty brethren assembled on this occasion; and if so, the reference to Judas's treachery would not be out of place in St. Peter's mouth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-26 The great thing the apostles were to attest to the world, was, Christ's resurrection; for that was the great proof of his being the Messiah, and the foundation of our hope in him. The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be committed to us.</body></html>
