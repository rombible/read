His purpose in making the quotation is to show that the disciples should not be staggered by the treachery of Judas, and the seeming failure of their hopes. The Psalms had represented the righteous sufferer as the victim of treachery. They had also spoken of the traitor as receiving a righteous punishment such as had now fallen upon Judas. No strange thing had happened. What had been of old was typical of what they had heard or known. We need not in this place discuss either the historical occasions of the Psalms cited, or the ethical difficulties presented by their imprecations of evil. Neither comes, so to speak, within the horizon of St. Peter's thoughts. It was enough for him to note the striking parallelism which they presented to what was fresh in his memory, and to believe that it was not accidental.<p><span class= "bld">His bishoprick let another take.</span>--Better, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-8.htm" title="Let his days be few; and let another take his office.">Psalm 109:8</a>, <span class= "ital">let another take his office.</span> The Greek word is <span class= "ital">episcope, </span>which, as meaning an office like that of the <span class= "ital">episcopos, </span>is, of course, in one sense, rightly translated by "bishoprick." The latter term is, however, so surrounded by associations foreign to the apostolic age that it is better to use the more general, and, therefore, neutral, term of the English version of the Psalm. The use of "bishoprick" may be noted as an instance of the tendency of the revisers of 1611 to maintain the use of "bishop" and the like where the office seemed to be placed on a high level (as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm" title="For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.">1Peter 2:25</a>), while they use "overseer" and "oversight" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>) where it is identified with the functions of the elders or presbyters of the Church. "Bishoprick" had, however, been used in all previous versions except the Geneva, which gives "charge."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> <span class="accented">- Made desolate</span> for <span class="accented">desolate</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">office</span> (as in margin) for <span class="accented">bishopric</span>, A.V. The book of Psalms, one of the recognized divisions of the canonical Scriptures, as we find <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>, "The law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms," the last standing for the Hagiographa, of which it was the first and principal book. Here, however, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-42.htm">Luke 20:42</a>, it may rather mean the Book of Psalms proper. (For similar quotations from the Psalms, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10</a>, etc.) His office let another <span class="accented">take. Bishop</span> being the English transliteration of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">bishopric</span> is, of course, the literal rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>; if taken in its wider and more general sense, as in the well-known work of Archdeacon Evans? "the bishopric of souls." This same office is called a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (a deaconship), and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> (an apostleship) in vers. 17 and 25. So St. Paul cells himself <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (a minister) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23, 25</a>, etc. So the presbyters of the Church are called bishops (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1, 2</a>. etc.). The ecclesiastical names for the different offices in the Church only acquired their distinctive use later, and by the gradual growth of custom.

The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be committed to us.</body></html>
