(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>.) The promise of the Father formed the subject of our Lord's discourse to the apostles on the last night of his earthly life, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16, 17, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7-14</a>. He doubtless here refers to that conversation, though not, of course, to the record of it in the Gospel of St. John. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Our Lord told the disciples the work they were to do. The apostles met together at Jerusalem; Christ having ordered them not to depart thence, but to wait for the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. This would be a baptism by the Holy Ghost, giving them power to work miracles, and enlightening and sanctifying their souls. This confirms the Divine promise, and encourages us to depend upon it, that we have heard it from Christ; for in Him all the promises of God are yea and amen.</body></html>
