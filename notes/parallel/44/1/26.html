The two men were chosen by the disciples as standing, as far as they could see, on the same level. It was left for the Searcher of hearts to show, by the exclusion of human will, which of the two He had chosen. The most usual way of casting lots in such cases was to write each name on a tablet, place them in an urn, and then shake the urn till one came out. A like custom prevailed among the Greeks, as in the well-known story of the stratagem of Cresphontes in the division of territory after the Doriar invasion (Sophocles, <span class= "ital">Aias.</span> 1285; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a>). The practice was recognised, it may be noted, in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-8.htm" title="And Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.">Leviticus 16:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span>--The Greek word is not the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm" title="For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.">Acts 1:17</a>, and implies that Matthias was "voted in," the suffrage of the Church unanimously confirming the indication of the divine will which had been given by the lot. It may be that the new Apostle took the place which Judas had left vacant, and was the last of the Twelve.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="accented">They</span> <span class="accented">gave lots for them</span> for they <span class="accented">gave forth their lots</span>, A.V. and T.R.

The exact mode of taking the lot does not appear. Some think the name of each candidate was written on a tablet, and that the first name which fell out of the urn after it had been shaken was the one chosen. Some think the lot was taken by dice. But however the taking of the lot was managed, the effect was to leave the choice to God in answer to prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-26 The great thing the apostles were to attest to the world, was, Christ's resurrection; for that was the great proof of his being the Messiah, and the foundation of our hope in him. The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be committed to us.</body></html>
