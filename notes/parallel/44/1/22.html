He began to go in and out among his apostles from the time that John baptized, and continued to do so till his ascension, the day that he was received up ("taken up" A.V.), as in ver. 11. This definition of the time of our Lord's public ministry exactly agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1.htm">Mark 1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3.htm">Luke 3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-51</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Must one become a witness</span>, etc. The resurrection of Christ from the dead thus appears to be a cardinal doctrine of the gospel. The whole truth of Christ's mission, the acceptance of his sacrifice, the consequent forgiveness of sins, and all man's hopes of eternal life, turn upon it. All the sermons of the apostles recorded in the Acts and the Epistles also agree with this (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2.htm">Acts 2, 3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>:56, 59; 10:39-41; 13:30, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1.htm">1 Peter 1</a>.3; 3:21,22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>,etc.). The great care taken to secure competent witnesses is very remarkable. A disciple who had recently joined the company might be mistaken; one who had been the daily companion of Jesus Christ for three years and a half, and knew every gesture and every feature of the Master with perfect certainty, could not be mistaken. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-26 The great thing the apostles were to attest to the world, was, Christ's resurrection; for that was the great proof of his being the Messiah, and the foundation of our hope in him. The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be committed to us.</body></html>
