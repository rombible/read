No other New Testament writer uses it.<p><span class= "bld">Being seen of them forty days.</span>--St. Luke uses a peculiar and unusual word (it occurs twice in the LXX.: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm" title="And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are to this day.">1Kings 8:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/tobit/12-19.htm" title="All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision.">Tobit 12:19</a>) for "being seen," perhaps with the wish to imply that the presence was not continuous, and that our Lord was seen only at intervals. This may be noted as the only passage which gives the time between the Resurrection and the Ascension. It had its counterpart in the forty days of the Temptation in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-2.htm" title="Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungry.">Luke 4:2</a>), as that had had in the earlier histories of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-18.htm" title="And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm" title="When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I stayed in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm" title="And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which you sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>) and Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm" title="And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.">1Kings 19:8</a>). There was a certain symbolic fitness in the time of triumph on earth coinciding with that of special conflict. If we ask what was the character, if one may so speak, of our Lord's risen life between His manifestation to the disciples, the history of the earlier forty days in part suggests the answer. Then, as before, the life was, we may believe, one of solitude and communion with His Father, no longer tried and tempted, as it had then been, by contact with the power of evil--a life of intercession, such as that which uttered itself in the great prayer of John 17. Where the days and nights were spent we can only reverently conjecture. Analogy suggests the desert places and mountain heights or Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-42.htm" title="And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came to him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.">Luke 4:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12</a>). The mention of Bethany in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-50.htm" title="And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.">Luke 24:50</a>, and of the Mount of Olives in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm" title="Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.">Acts 1:12</a>, makes it probable that Gethsemane may have been one of the scenes that witnessed the joy of the victory, as it had witnessed before the agony of the conflict.<p><span class= "bld">The things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</span>--This implies, it is obvious, much unrecorded teaching. What is recorded points (1) to the true interpretation of the prophecies of the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm" title="And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.">Luke 24:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44-45</a>); (2) to the extension of the mission of the disciples to the whole Gentile world, and their admission to the Kingdom by baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>); (3) to the promises of supernatural powers and divine protection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/16-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.">Mark 16:15-18</a>); (4) to that of His own perpetual presence with His Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Proofs</span> for <span class="accented">infallible proofs</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">appearing unto them</span> for <span class="accented">seen of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">concerning</span> for <span class="accented">pertaining to</span>, A.V. The addition of the words by many proofs makes it necessary to understand the words allowed himself (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) in the sense which it bears both in classic and Scriptural Greek, of <span class="accented">proved</span> or <span class="accented">demon-strafed:</span> "To whom he gave distinct proofs of his being alive after his passion;" the proofs follow - being "seen of them" for forty days at intervals, talking with them, and (ver. 9) "being taken up while they were looking." Doubtless, too, he had in his mind those other proofs which he records in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>, and those referred to by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>). For this sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-13.htm">Acts 24:13</a>, "to rove:" and Lysias's 'Oration against Eratosthenes' (p. 125), where the almost identical phrase occurs which we have here, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, "I will prove both these things by many certain proofs." The A.V. rendering, "infallible proofs," was quite justified. Stephanus says, "De certo et indubitato signo dicitur apud Rhetoricos" ('Thesaurus,' 9216); and the technical meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in Aristotle is a "demonstrative proof," as opposed to a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which leaves room for doubt; and in medical writers, which is important as regards St. Luke, the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the "infallible symptom." St. Luke, by the use of the word here, undoubtedly meant to express the <span class="accented">certainty</span> of the conclusion based on those proofs. Appearing unto them. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> of the Epistle of Barnabas, cap. 15, only occurs in the New Testament in this place. In the Septuagint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a> it is used of the staves of the ark within the veil, which "were not seen without." The idea intended to be conveyed, both by the use of this verb and by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> (by the space of), is that our Lord was not with the apostles always, as he was before the Resurrection, but that he came and again disappeared (St. Chrysostom). They were fleeting appearances spread over forty days. The nearly related substantive, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, means "a vision," and is frequently used by St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-23.htm">Luke 24:23</a>; 26:19. It is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:l. <span class="cmt_word">Concerning the kingdom of God</span>; a subject which had deeply engaged their thoughts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11</a>), and on which it was most needful that they should now be fully instructed, that they might teach others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Our Lord told the disciples the work they were to do. The apostles met together at Jerusalem; Christ having ordered them not to depart thence, but to wait for the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. This would be a baptism by the Holy Ghost, giving them power to work miracles, and enlightening and sanctifying their souls. This confirms the Divine promise, and encourages us to depend upon it, that we have heard it from Christ; for in Him all the promises of God are yea and amen.</body></html>
