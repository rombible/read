Here, again, men have asked questions which they cannot answer; not only, when shall the end be, but where shall the Judge thus appear? what place shall be the chosen scene of His second Advent? So far as we dare to localise what is left undefined, the words of the angels suggest the same scene, as well as the same manner. Those who do not shrink from taking the words of prophecy in their most literal sense, have seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm" title="And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall split in the middle thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.">Zechariah 14:4</a>, an intimation that the Valley of Jehosophat (= Jehovah judges)--the "valley of decision"--shall witness the great Assize, and that the feet of the Judge shall stand upon the Mount of Olives, from which He had ascended into heaven. This was the current mediaeval view, and seems, if we are to localise at all, to be more probable than any other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Looking</span> for <span class="accented">gazing up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">this</span> for <span class="accented">this same</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">was received</span> for is <span class="accented">taken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">beheld</span> <span class="accented">him going</span> for <span class="accented">have seen him go</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In like manner</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a cloud. The description of our Lord's second advent constantly makes mention of clouds. "Behold, he cometh with clouds" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>). "One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>; and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-27.htm">Luke 21:27</a>, etc.). We are reminded of the grand imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>, "Who maketh the clouds his chariot, who walketh upon the wings of the wind." It may be remarked that the above is by far the fullest account we have of the ascension of our Lord. St. Luke appears to have learnt some further particulars concerning it in the interval between writing his Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50-52</a>) and writing the Acts. But allusions to the Ascension are frequent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-62.htm">John 6:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>, etc.). With reference to Zeller's assertion, that in St. <span class="accented">Luke's</span> Gospel the Ascension is represented as taking place on the day of the Resurrection, it may freely be admitted that the narrative in the Gospel does not mark distinctly the interval of time between the different appearances and discourses of our Lord from the day of the Resurrection to that of the Ascension. It seems to group them according to their logical connection rather than according to their chronological sequence, and to be a general account of what Jesus said between the Resurrection and the Ascension. But there is nothing whatever in the text of St. Luke to indicate that what is related in the section Luke 24:44-49 took place at the same time as the things related in the preceding verses. And when we compare with that section what is contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>, it becomes clear that it did not. Because the words "assembling together with them," in ver. 4, clearly indicate a different occasion from the apparitions on the day of the Resurrection; and as the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44-49</a> correspond with those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>, it must have been also on a different occasion that they were spoken. Again, the narrative of St. John, both in the twentieth and the twenty-first chapters, as well as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>, precludes the possibility of the Ascension having taken place, or having been thought to have taken place, on the day of the Resurrection, or for many days after, so that to force a meaning upon the last chapter of St. Luke's Gospel which it does not necessarily bear, and which places it at variance with St. Luke's own account in the Acts (Acts 1:3; 13:31), and with the Church traditions as preserved by St. Matthew, St. Mark and St. John, is a violent and willful transaction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-11 They were earnest in asking about that which their Master never had directed or encouraged them to seek. Our Lord knew that his ascension and the teaching of the Holy Spirit would soon end these expectations, and therefore only gave them a rebuke; but it is a caution to his church in all ages, to take heed of a desire of forbidden knowledge. He had given his disciples instructions for the discharge of their duty, both before his death and since his resurrection, and this knowledge is enough for a Christian. It is enough that He has engaged to give believers strength equal to their trials and services; that under the influence of the Holy Spirit they may, in one way or other, be witnesses for Christ on earth, while in heaven he manages their concerns with perfect wisdom, truth, and love. When we stand gazing and trifling, the thoughts of our Master's second coming should quicken and awaken us: when we stand gazing and trembling, they should comfort and encourage us. May our expectation of it be stedfast and joyful, giving diligence to be found of him blameless.</body></html>
