And this witness was two-fold: (1) of the works, the teachings, and, above all, of the Resurrection of Jesus; (2) of the purpose of the Father as revealed in the Son. The witness was to be, in language which, though technical, is yet the truest expression of the fact, at once historical and dogmatic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- When</span> for <span class="accented">after that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">my witnesses</span> for <span class="accented">witnesses unto me</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Samaria</span> for in <span class="accented">Samaria</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall receive power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); a word sped-ally used of the power of the Holy Spirit <span class="cmt_word">(see Acts</span> 6:8).

This function of the apostles, to be witnesses of Christ, is one much insisted upon in Scripture. So we read in ver. 22, "Of these must one become ['be ordained,' A.V.] a witness with us of his resurrection." So again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-40.htm">Acts 10:40-42</a>, "God... showed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us.... And he commanded us to testify," etc. (see also Vers. 39 and 42 of the same chapter; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-31.htm">Acts 13:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-48.htm">Luke 24:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-33.htm">Acts 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-31.htm">Acts 13:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-15.htm">Acts 22:15, 18, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-1.htm">1 Peter 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1.htm">1 John 1-3</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:6-11 They were earnest in asking about that which their Master never had directed or encouraged them to seek. Our Lord knew that his ascension and the teaching of the Holy Spirit would soon end these expectations, and therefore only gave them a rebuke; but it is a caution to his church in all ages, to take heed of a desire of forbidden knowledge. He had given his disciples instructions for the discharge of their duty, both before his death and since his resurrection, and this knowledge is enough for a Christian. It is enough that He has engaged to give believers strength equal to their trials and services; that under the influence of the Holy Spirit they may, in one way or other, be witnesses for Christ on earth, while in heaven he manages their concerns with perfect wisdom, truth, and love. When we stand gazing and trifling, the thoughts of our Master's second coming should quicken and awaken us: when we stand gazing and trembling, they should comfort and encourage us. May our expectation of it be stedfast and joyful, giving diligence to be found of him blameless.</body></html>
