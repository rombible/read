The room may have been the same as that in which the Paschal Supper had been eaten (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-15.htm" title="And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.">Mark 14:15</a>). On the other hand, that room seems to have been different from that in which the disciples had lodged during the Paschal week, and to have been chosen specially for the occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8</a>). The word used is also different in form. So far as we are able to distinguish between the two words, the room of the Paschal Supper was on the first floor, the guest-chamber, used for meals; that in which the disciples now met, on the second floor, or loft, which was used for retirement and prayer. It would seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-53.htm" title="And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.">Luke 24:53</a>, that they spent the greater part of each day in the Temple, and met together in the evening. The better MSS. give "prayer" only, without "supplication." The prayer thus offered may be thought of as specially directed to the "promise of the Father." Whether it was spoken or silent, unpremeditated or in some set form of words, like the Lord's Prayer, we have no <span class= "ital">data</span> to determine.<p><span class= "bld">Peter, and James.</span>--On the lists of the Twelve Apostles see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-2.htm" title="Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;">Matthew 10:2-4</a>. The points to be noticed are--(1) that Andrew stands last in the group of the first four, divided from his brother, thus agreeing with the list in St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-17.htm" title="And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:">Mark 3:17</a>); (2) that Philip is in like manner divided from Bartholomew, and Thomas from Matthew; (3) that Zelotes appears here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-15.htm" title="Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,">Luke 6:15</a>, instead of the Cananaean.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">The upper chamber</span> for <span class="accented">an upper room</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">where they were abiding</span> for <span class="accented">where abode</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">son of James</span> for <span class="accented">brother of James</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The upper chamber</span>; perhaps the same room where they had eaten the Passover with Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-12.htm">Luke 22:12</a>); but this is very uncertain, though affirmed by Epiphanius, and by Nicephorus, who further relates that the very house in which the upper chamber was built into the back part of the temple which the Empress Helena erected on Mount Sion. The word here is <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, there it is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-10.htm">2 Kings 4:10, 11</a>) was the room immediately under the roof; the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was synonymous. Where they were abiding. A slight change in the order of the words, as adopted in the text of the R.V., makes Peter and the other apostles the nominative case to the verb "went up," instead of, as in the A.V., to "abode." In regard to the list of the apostles which follows, it may be noticed first, that it is identical with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-14.htm">Luke 6:14-16</a>, except in the omission of Judas Iscariot and the order in which the apostles are named. The order in Luke seems to have followed that of natural birth and association. The brothers, Peter and Andrew, James and John, are classed together; Philip and Bartholomew, or Nathanael, go together, and so on. But in this list John follows Peter, his close companion in missionary work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>, etc.; Acts 4:12; 8:14); James follows instead of preceding John; and others are classed somewhat differently, for reasons probably analogous, but which we know not. Of the other lists that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16-19</a> agrees most nearly with that before us. In all, Simon Peter stands <span class="accented">first.</span> The Jude of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-16.htm">Luke 6:16</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a> is called <span class="accented">Thaddaeus</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a> (" Lebbaeus whose surname was Thaddaeus," A.V.) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>; but no doubt the persons are the same. In all the lists Philip stands fifth. In three Bartholomew is sixth, while in the list in Acts his being named after Thomas makes him seventh. In all the lists James the son of Alphaeus is ninth, and Judas Iscariot the last, except in the Acts, where he is not named, being already dead.

They made supplication. All God's people are praying people. It was now a time of trouble and danger with the disciples of Christ; but if any is afflicted, let him pray; that will silence cares and fears. They had now a great work to do, and before they entered upon it, they were earnest in prayer to God for his presence. They were waiting for the descent of the Spirit, and abounded in prayer. Those are in the best frame to receive spiritual blessings, who are in a praying frame. Christ had promised shortly to send the Holy Ghost; that promise was not to do away prayer, but to quicken and encourage it. A little company united in love, exemplary in their conduct, fervent in prayer, and wisely zealous to promote the cause of Christ, are likely to increase rapidly.</body></html>
