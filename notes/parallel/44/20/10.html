The close contact, the clasp of warm affection, gave a new intensity to the prayer of faith, and, as a current of vitality passed, as it were, from the one body to the other, enabled the Apostle to feel that the heart had not ceased to beat, and to give the calming assurance, "his life is in him." The whole scene is painted, as before, vividly, as by an eye-witness. We have to think of the cries of alarm, the rush of men down the staircase from the third floor with lamps and torches in their hands, the wail of sorrow on finding what looked like death, the undisturbed calmness of the Apostle, sure that his prayer was answered, and returning quietly, leaving the motionless body in the cool night air, to finish the interrupted discourse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- Make ye no ado</span> for <span class="accented">trouble not yourselves</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Fell on him</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and embracing him said</span>; imitating the action of Elijah and Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-34.htm">2 Kings 4:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Make ye no ado</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are words especially used of the lamentations made for the dead. Thus when Jesus came to the house of Jairus, he found the multitude outside the house, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "making a tumult." This is still more clearly brought out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-38.htm">Mark 5:38, 39</a>, "He beholdeth a tumult (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and many weeping and wailing greatly. And... he saith unto them, Why make yea tumult (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), and weep? The child is not dead, but sleepeth." In exactly the same way St. Paul here calms the rising sobs and wailings of the people standing round the body of Eutychus, by saying, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>," Do not wail over him as dead, for his life is in him." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:7-12 Though the disciples read, and meditated, and prayed, and sung apart, and thereby kept up communion with God, yet they came together to worship God, and so kept up their communion with one another. They came together on the first day of the week, the Lord's day. It is to be religiously observed by all disciples of Christ. In the breaking of the bread, not only the breaking of Christ's body for us, to be a sacrifice for our sins, is remembered, but the breaking of Christ's body to us, to be food and a feast for our souls, is signified. In the early times it was the custom to receive the Lord's supper every Lord's day, thus celebrating the memorial of Christ's death. In this assembly Paul preached. The preaching of the gospel ought to go with the sacraments. They were willing to hear, he saw they were so, and continued his speech till midnight. Sleeping when hearing the word, is an evil thing, a sign of low esteem of the word of God. We must do what we can to prevent being sleepy; not put ourselves to sleep, but get our hearts affected with the word we hear, so as to drive sleep far away. Infirmity requires tenderness; but contempt requires severity. It interrupted the apostle's preaching; but was made to confirm his preaching. Eutychus was brought to life again. And as they knew not when they should have Paul's company again, they made the best use of it they could, and reckoned a night's sleep well lost for that purpose.
