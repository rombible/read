He, St. Paul seems to say of himself, had used no such reticence or reserve, but had gone on his course, as it were, before the wind, with all his canvas spread. It must be noted, however, that even here, as in the more limited range of teaching imparted to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1Corinthians 3:1-2</a>), he confines his statement to the things that were "profitable." In each case he considered what was required by the capacity of his disciples. That of Ephesus was wider than that of Corinth, and there, accordingly, he was able to set forth "the whole counsel of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Publicly, and from house to house.</span>--The first word points probably to the teaching in the synagogue and the lecture-room of Tyrannus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>), the second to the meetings of disciples which were held in private houses, such as that of Aquila and Priscilla (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1Corinthians 16:19</a>).

The difference of rendering is required by the fact that here you have <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, whereas in ver. 27 you have <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> In several of the classical passages quoted above, and others in Schleusner, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, or, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (comp. therefore for the sentiment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13, 29, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-3.htm">Acts 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-31.htm">Acts 28:31</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19, 20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:17-27 The elders knew that Paul was no designing, self-seeking man. Those who would in any office serve the Lord acceptably, and profitably to others, must do it with humility. He was a plain preacher, one that spoke his message so as to be understood. He was a powerful preacher; he preached the gospel as a testimony to them if they received it; but as a testimony against them if they rejected it. He was a profitable preacher; one that aimed to inform their judgments, and reform their hearts and lives. He was a painful preacher, very industrious in his work. He was a faithful preacher; he did not keep back reproofs when necessary, nor keep back the preaching of the cross. He was a truly Christian, evangelical preacher; he did not preach notions or doubtful matters; nor affairs of state or the civil government; but he preached faith and repentance. A better summary of these things, without which there is no salvation, cannot be given: even repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, with their fruits and effects. Without these no sinner can escape, and with these none will come short of eternal life. Let them not think that Paul left Asia for fear of persecution; he was in full expectation of trouble, yet resolved to go on, well assured that it was by Divine direction. Thanks be to God that we know not the things which shall befall us during the year, the week, the day which has begun. It is enough for the child of God to know that his strength shall be equal to his day. He knows not, he would not know, what the day before him shall bring forth. The powerful influences of the Holy Spirit bind the true Christian to his duty. Even when he expects persecution and affliction, the love of Christ constrains him to proceed. None of these things moved Paul from his work; they did not deprive him of his comfort. It is the business of our life to provide for a joyful death. Believing that this was the last time they should see him, he appeals concerning his integrity. He had preached to them the whole counsel of God. As he had preached to them the gospel purely, so he had preached it to them entire; he faithfully did his work, whether men would bear or forbear.</body></html>
