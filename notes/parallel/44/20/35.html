The common use of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> is, as rendered in the A.V., "to show," "to teach," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47</a>; and repeatedly in the LXX. But perhaps its force here is equivalent to the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x7d;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you," as the R.V. takes it. <span class="cmt_word">So laboring</span>; viz. as ye have seen me do. <span class="cmt_word">To help the weak</span>. Meyer, following Bengel and others, understands this to mean the weak in faith," like <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>. They say that St. Paul's self-denial in refusing the help he had a right to claim as an apostle, and supporting himself by his labor, was a great argument to convince the weak in faith of his disinterestedness and of the truth of his gospel, and so he recommends the elders of the Church to follow his example. But the word here is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> rather suggest the idea of bodily weakness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>, etc.), and the words of the Lord Jesus which follow suggest almsgiving to the needy. So that it is better to understand the word of the weakly and poor, those unable to work for themselves. Doubtless St. Paul, out of his scanty earnings, found something to give to the sick and needy. The sentiment in our text is thus exactly analogous to the precept in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>. The very word there used, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, recalls the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 34. <span class="cmt_word">To remember the words of the Lord Jesus</span>. This is a solitary instance era saying of our Lord's, not recorded in the Gospels, being referred to in Scripture. There are many alleged sayings of Christ recorded in apocryphal Gospels or in the writings of Fathers as Papias and others (Routh, 'Reliq. Sac.,' 1:9, 10, 12), some of which may be authentic; but this alone is warranted by Scripture. How it came to St Paul's knowledge, and that of the Ephesian elders to whom he seems to have taken for granted that it was familiar, it is impossible to say. But it seems likely that, in those very early days, some of the Lord's unwritten words may have floated in the memory of men, and been preserved by word of mouth. Clement (1 Corinthians it.) seems to refer to the saying when he writes in praise of the former character of the Corinthians, that they were then <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. But he probably had it from the Acts of the Apostles, as had the author of the 'Apostol. Constitut.' (4. 3, 1). Similar apophthegms are quoted from heathen writers, as those cited by Kuinoel: <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (Artemidor., 'Onirocr.,' 4, 3); <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> (Arist., 'Nieom.,' 4, 1), "It is more becoming to a free man to give to whom he ought to give, than to receive from whom he ought to receive." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:28-38 If the Holy Ghost has made ministers overseers of the flock, that is, shepherds, they must be true to their trust. Let them consider their Master's concern for the flock committed to their charge. It is the church He has purchased with his own blood. The blood was his as Man; yet so close is the union between the Divine and human nature, that it is there called the blood of God, for it was the blood of Him who is God. This put such dignity and worth into it, as to ransom believers from all evil, and purchase all good. Paul spake about their souls with affection and concern. They were full of care what would become of them. Paul directs them to look up to God with faith, and commends them to the word of God's grace, not only as the foundation of their hope and the fountain of their joy, but as the rule of their walking. The most advanced Christians are capable of growing, and will find the word of grace help their growth. As those cannot be welcome guests to the holy God who are unsanctified; so heaven would be no heaven to them; but to all who are born again, and on whom the image of God is renewed, it is sure, as almighty power and eternal truth make it so. He recommends himself to them as an example of not caring as to things of the present world; this they would find help forward their comfortable passage through it. It might seem a hard saying, therefore Paul adds to it a saying of their Master's, which he would have them always remember; It is more blessed to give than to receive: it seems they were words often used to his disciples. The opinion of the children of this world, is contrary to this; they are afraid of giving, unless in hope of getting. Clear gain, is with them the most blessed thing that can be; but Christ tell us what is more blessed, more excellent. It makes us more like to God, who gives to all, and receives from none; and to the Lord Jesus, who went about doing good. This mind was in Christ Jesus, may it be in us also. It is good for friends, when they part, to part with prayer. Those who exhort and pray for one another, may have many weeping seasons and painful separations, but they will meet before the throne of God, to part no more. It was a comfort to all, that the presence of Christ both went with him and stayed with them.</body></html>
