His intention was, however, frustrated. The malignant Jews of Corinth watched their opportunity. At Cenchreae, amid the stir and bustle of a port, they might do what they had failed to do before. Here there was no Gallio to curb their fury, and throw the aegis of his tolerant equity over their victim. Their plans were laid, and their victim was to be seized and made away with as he was on the point of embarking. On hearing of the plot, the Apostle had to change his plans, and started with his companions for Macedonia, either travelling by land or taking a ship bound for one of its ports, instead of the one bound for Caesarea, or Tyre, or Joppa. It is clear that the latter course would have baffled his murderers quite as much as the former.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- When he had spent ... there</span> for <span class="accented">there abode</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a plot was laid against him by the Jews</span> for <span class="accented">when the Jews laid wait for him</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">for</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">determined</span> for <span class="accented">purposed</span>, A.V.

The three months were probably chiefly spent at Corinth, according to the intention expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>, though it would seem that he had stayed a longer time in Macedonia than he anticipated. It was during his sojourn at Corinth that the Epistle to the Romans was written. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-6 Tumults or opposition may constrain a Christian to remove from his station or alter his purpose, but his work and his pleasure will be the same, wherever he goes. Paul thought it worth while to bestow five days in going to Troas, though it was but for seven days' stay there; but he knew, and so should we, how to redeem even journeying time, and to make it turn to some good account.</body></html>
