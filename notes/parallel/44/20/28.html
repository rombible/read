It will be noticed that the word is commonly used in the New Testament as associated with this imagery. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm" title="For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.">1Peter 2:25</a>, we have "the Shepherd and <span class= "ital">Bishop</span> of your souls," and the corresponding verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>, "feed the flock of God . . . <span class= "ital">taking the oversight</span> thereof." The appointment, as referred to the Holy Ghost, implies, probably, (1) the inward call, the impulse which drew the man to the office; (2) the attestation of that call by the voices of the prophets, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1Timothy 4:1</a>; (3) the bestowal of gifts fitting them for the work.<p><span class= "bld">To feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</span>--It is clear that the words as they stand in the text are of immense importance, as bearing their witness to the belief of the Apostolic Church at once in the absolute divinity of Christ and in the nature of His redemptive work. The MSS., however, vary in their readings. Some of the best uncials and versions give "God;" others, of almost equal authority, give "Lord;" others, again, combine the two "Lord and God." The fact that elsewhere St. Paul invariably speaks of "the Church of God" (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm" title="For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:">Galatians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1Thessalonians 2:14</a>, <span class= "ital">et</span> <span class= "ital">al</span>.), and never "the Church of the Lord," may be allowed, from one point of view, some weight as internal evidence in favour of the Received reading; while from another it may be urged that it might have tempted a transcriber to substitute a familiar for an unfamiliar phrase. Accepting that reading, the words not only confirm the great truths of the Church's creed, but give an implicit sanction to the language of theology or devotion, when it applies to the divine nature of our Lord predicates that belong strictly to the human nature which was associated with it. So Ignatius (<span class= "ital">Romans 6</span>) spoke of "the passion of my God," and Tertullian (<span class= "ital">Ad Uxor, </span>ii. 3) and Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Quis dives, </span>c. 34) use the very phrase "the blood of God" which this passage suggests, and the Eastern Church at the council of Ephesus gave to the Blessed Virgin the title of <span class= "ital">Theot?kos Deipara, </span>the mother of the very God. So in the liturgy which bears the name of St. James the brother of the Lord, he is described as <span class= "ital">Adelphotheos, </span>the brother of God, and that name is still current among the Greek Christians of Jerusalem. The general drift of the language of the New Testament writers was, however, in the other direction, and predicated human acts and attributes of the man Christ Jesus, Divine acts and attributes of the eternal Son; and it is obvious that this tends at once to greater accuracy of thought, and is really more reverential than the other.<p>In the word "purchased" (or, more literally, <span class= "ital">acquired for himself</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>we recognise the idea, though not the word, of redemption. The same verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-13.htm" title="For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.">1Timothy 3:13</a>. The thought seems to have been one which specially characterised the teaching of St. Paul at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a> : "the redemption of the purchased possession"). Comp. also, "ye were bought with a price," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>, which, it will be remembered, was written from that city. The same idea is expressed in the "peculiar people" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a>; literally, <span class= "ital">a people for a purchased possession, </span>and so, as it were, the <span class= "ital">peculium, </span>or personal property of Him who had paid the purchase money.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> <span class="accented">- Take heed</span> for <span class="accented">take heed therefore</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">in</span> for <span class="accented">over</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">bishops</span> for <span class="accented">overseers</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">purchased</span> for <span class="accented">hath purchased</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed</span>, etc.; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, peculiar to Luke (Acts 5:53; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-3.htm">Luke 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>). Now follows the weighty charge of this great bishop to the clergy assembled at his visitation. With the true feeling of a chief pastor, he thinks of the whole flock, but deals with them chiefly through the under-shepherds. If he can awaken in these individually a deep concern for the souls committed to their charge, he will have done the best that can be done for the fleck at large. The first step to such concern for the flock is that each be thoroughly alive to the worth and the wants of his own soul. "Take heed unto yourselves." He that is careless about his own salvation will never lie careful about the souls of others (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the which the Holy Ghost</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>, no doubt, does not strictly contain the idea of "over which;" but the idea of authoritative oversight is contained in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and therefore the rendering of the A.V., and of Alford's A.V. revised, is substantially correct. Perhaps the exact force of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span> is "among which," like <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29</a>, and elsewhere). The call and appointment to the ministry is the special function of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>; Ordination Service). <span class="cmt_word">To feed</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, the proper word for "tending" in relation to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the flock, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, the pastor, or shepherd, is for him who so feeds the flock of Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2, 3</a>). St. Peter applies the titles of "Shepherd and Bishop of souls" to the Lord Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>). St. Paul does not use the metaphor elsewhere, except indirectly, and in a different aspect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Church of God</span>; margin, <span class="accented">Church of the Lord.</span> There is, perhaps, no single passage in Scripture which has caused more controversy and evoked more difference of opinion than this. The T.R. has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, but most uncials have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Kuinoel asserts that the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> rests on the authority, besides that of the oldest manuscripts, of the old versions, and of many el' the most ancient Fathers, and says that it is undoubtedly the true reading. Meyer, too, thinks that the external evidence for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is decisive, and that the internal evidence from the fact that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> Occurs nowhere else in St. Paul's writings, is decisive also. But on the other hand, both the Codex Vaticanus (B) and the Codex Sinaitieus (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>), the two oldest manuscripts, have <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c5;</span>). The Vulgate, too, and the Syriac have it; and such early Fathers as Ignatius (in his Epistle to the Ephesians) and Tertullian use the phrase, "the blood of God," which seems to have been derived from this passage. And Alford reasons powerfully in favor of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, dwelling upon the fact that the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> occurs <span class="accented">ten times</span> in St. Paul's writings, that of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> not once. The chief authorities on each side of the question are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in favor of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, Lachmann, Tischendorf, Bornemann, Lunge, Olshausen, Davidson, Meyer, Hackett, as also Grotius, Griesbaeh (doubtfully), Wetstein, Le Clerc, and others; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in favor of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, Bengel, Mill, Whitby, Wolf, Scholz, Knapp, Alford, Wordsworth, etc., and the R.T. It should be added that the evidence for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> has been much strengthened by the publication by Tischendorf, in 1563, of rite Codex Sinaiticus, and in 1867 of the Codex Vaticanus, from his own collation. The result is that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> seems to be the true reading (see the first of the two collects for the Ember weeks in the Book of Common Prayer. With regard to the difficulty that this reading seems to imply the unscriptural phrase, "<span class="accented">the</span> blood of God," and to savor of the Monophysite heresy, it is obvious to reply that there is a wide difference between the phrase as it stands and such a one as the direct "<span class="accented">blood</span> of <span class="accented">God</span>," which Athanasius and others objected to. The mental insertion of "the Lord" or "Christ," as the subject of the verb "<span class="accented">purchased</span>," is very easy, the transition from God the Father to God incarnate being one that might be made almost imperceptibly. Others (including the R.T.) take the reading of several good manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and understand <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to be an ellipse for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, the phrase used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; and so render it "<span class="accented">which</span> he purchased by the blood of his own Son." <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, his own, is used without a substantive in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>. This clause is added to enhance the preciousness of the flock, and the responsibility of those who have the oversight of it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:28-38 If the Holy Ghost has made ministers overseers of the flock, that is, shepherds, they must be true to their trust. Let them consider their Master's concern for the flock committed to their charge. It is the church He has purchased with his own blood. The blood was his as Man; yet so close is the union between the Divine and human nature, that it is there called the blood of God, for it was the blood of Him who is God. This put such dignity and worth into it, as to ransom believers from all evil, and purchase all good. Paul spake about their souls with affection and concern. They were full of care what would become of them. Paul directs them to look up to God with faith, and commends them to the word of God's grace, not only as the foundation of their hope and the fountain of their joy, but as the rule of their walking. The most advanced Christians are capable of growing, and will find the word of grace help their growth. As those cannot be welcome guests to the holy God who are unsanctified; so heaven would be no heaven to them; but to all who are born again, and on whom the image of God is renewed, it is sure, as almighty power and eternal truth make it so. He recommends himself to them as an example of not caring as to things of the present world; this they would find help forward their comfortable passage through it. It might seem a hard saying, therefore Paul adds to it a saying of their Master's, which he would have them always remember; It is more blessed to give than to receive: it seems they were words often used to his disciples. The opinion of the children of this world, is contrary to this; they are afraid of giving, unless in hope of getting. Clear gain, is with them the most blessed thing that can be; but Christ tell us what is more blessed, more excellent. It makes us more like to God, who gives to all, and receives from none; and to the Lord Jesus, who went about doing good. This mind was in Christ Jesus, may it be in us also. It is good for friends, when they part, to part with prayer. Those who exhort and pray for one another, may have many weeping seasons and painful separations, but they will meet before the throne of God, to part no more. It was a comfort to all, that the presence of Christ both went with him and stayed with them.</body></html>
