The passage is grander without them. What St. Paul desired was to finish his course--whether "with joy" or not mattered little. The dominance of the same ruling thought finds utterance once again in his last Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus.</span>--We have again to note the parallelism with St. Paul's language elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;">2Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;">2Corinthians 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12</a>); the words that follow are in apposition with the "ministry," and explain what it consisted in. To bear witness, especially as a living example of its power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12-16</a>), of the good tidings that God was not a harsh Judge, but a gracious Father, willing all men to be saved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm" title="Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.">1Timothy 2:4</a>), that was the truth to the proclamation of which his life was to be devoted. In this there was the central truth of the kingdom of God, of which the next verse speaks.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- I hold not my life of any account, as dear</span> for <span class="accented">none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">may accomplish my course</span> for <span class="accented">might finish my course with joy</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">received</span> for <span class="accented">have received</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for of, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I hold not my life</span>, etc. It is inconceivable that St. Paul should have uttered, or St. Luke have reported, such an unintelligible sentence as that of the R.T., when it was perfectly easy to express the meaning clearly. Neither does the mention of his life, in the first instance, tally with that of "bonds and afflictions." The T.R., which has considerable support, seems to be far preferable. The first clause, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, means quite naturally," I take no account of anything;" I value nothing, neither liberty, nor ease, nor comfort. I am ready to suffer the loss of all things, and I do count them as dung (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-9</a>); and then he adds yet further, "Neither do I count my own life as precious, so as to accomplish my course," etc. This metaphor of running a race is a favorite one with St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To testify the gospel of the grace of God</span>. An invaluable epitome of the Christian ministry. The essential feature of the gospel is its declaration of God's free grace to a guilty world, forgiving sins, and imputing righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. The distinctive work of the ministry is to declare that grace. So St. Paul describes his own ministry, and the record of his ministry in the Acts and in his Epistles exactly agrees with this description. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:17-27 The elders knew that Paul was no designing, self-seeking man. Those who would in any office serve the Lord acceptably, and profitably to others, must do it with humility. He was a plain preacher, one that spoke his message so as to be understood. He was a powerful preacher; he preached the gospel as a testimony to them if they received it; but as a testimony against them if they rejected it. He was a profitable preacher; one that aimed to inform their judgments, and reform their hearts and lives. He was a painful preacher, very industrious in his work. He was a faithful preacher; he did not keep back reproofs when necessary, nor keep back the preaching of the cross. He was a truly Christian, evangelical preacher; he did not preach notions or doubtful matters; nor affairs of state or the civil government; but he preached faith and repentance. A better summary of these things, without which there is no salvation, cannot be given: even repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, with their fruits and effects. Without these no sinner can escape, and with these none will come short of eternal life. Let them not think that Paul left Asia for fear of persecution; he was in full expectation of trouble, yet resolved to go on, well assured that it was by Divine direction. Thanks be to God that we know not the things which shall befall us during the year, the week, the day which has begun. It is enough for the child of God to know that his strength shall be equal to his day. He knows not, he would not know, what the day before him shall bring forth. The powerful influences of the Holy Spirit bind the true Christian to his duty. Even when he expects persecution and affliction, the love of Christ constrains him to proceed. None of these things moved Paul from his work; they did not deprive him of his comfort. It is the business of our life to provide for a joyful death. Believing that this was the last time they should see him, he appeals concerning his integrity. He had preached to them the whole counsel of God. As he had preached to them the gospel purely, so he had preached it to them entire; he faithfully did his work, whether men would bear or forbear.</body></html>
