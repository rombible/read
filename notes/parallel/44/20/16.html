What is meant is that he had decided to continue his voyage without going to Ephesus--to pass it by.<p><span class= "bld">To be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</span>--The motives for this wish lie on the surface. (1) It was, as has been said in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1</a>, the Feast that attracted most pilgrims from all parts of the world, and therefore gave most scope for his work as an Apostle, especially for the great task of healing the growing breach between the Jewish and Gentile Christians. (2) It revived the memories and the power of the great day which had been the birthday of the Church's life as a distinct society. (3) St. Paul was contemplating a journey from Syria to Rome after his visit, and that would hardly have been feasible had he waited for the Feast of the Tabernacles. It might have seemed at first as if there was little gained in point of time by sending for the elders to come to him instead of going to them. We must remember, however, that had he taken the journey he would have been exposed to the accidents of travel, perhaps to a fresh riot like that of Demetrius, and might have been detained beyond the day fixed for the departure of the ship. By remaining at Miletus it was in his power to embark at any moment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- Past</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that he might not have to</span> for <span class="accented">because he would not</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">time</span> for <span class="accented">the time</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">was hastening</span> for <span class="accented">hasted</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To spend time</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, found only here in the New Testament, but used by Aristotle and others.

Paul was at Philippi at the time of the Passover, and hoped to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:13-16 Paul hastened to Jerusalem, but tried to do good by the way, when going from place to place, as every good man should do. In doing God's work, our own wills and those of our friends must often be crossed; we must not spend time with them when duty calls us another way.</body></html>
