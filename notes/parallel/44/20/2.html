We may take for granted that St. Paul would revisit the churches which he had himself founded at Thessalonica and Beraea, as well as at Philippi. The names in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a> indicate that delegates were chosen, probably by his direction, for the great journey to Jerusalem, which he now began to contemplate. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a> indicates a yet wider range of activity. He had taken the great Roman road across Macedonia, and going westward to the shores of the Adriatic, had preached the gospel in Illyricum, where as yet it had not been heard.<p><span class= "bld">He came into Greece.</span>--The word Hellas, or Greece, seems used as synonymous with Achaia, the southern province. This may have led to an unrecorded visit to Athens. It certainly brought him to Corinth and Cenchreae. There, we may hope, he found all his hopes fulfilled. Gaius was there to receive him as a guest, and Erastus was still a faithful friend. There, if not before, he found Timotheus, and he had with him Jason of Thessalonica and Sosipater of Ber?a (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-21.htm" title="Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.">Romans 16:21-23</a>). In one respect, however, he found a great change, and missed many friends. The decree of Claudius had either been revoked or was no longer acted on. Aquila and Priscilla had gone straight from Ephesus to Rome on hearing that they could do so with safety, and with them the many friends, male and female, most of them of the <span class= "ital">libertini</span> class, whom he had known in Corinth, and whose names fill so large a space in Romans 16. The desire which he had felt before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.">Acts 19:21</a>) to see Rome was naturally strengthened by their absence. His work in Greece was done, and he felt an impulse, not merely human, drawing him to the further west. A rapid journey to Jerusalem, a short visit there, to show how generous were the gifts which the Gentile Churches sent to the Churches of the Circumcision, and then the desire of his life might be gratified. To preach the gospel in Rome, to pass on from Rome to the Jews at Cordova and other cities in Spain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/15-24.htm" title="Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.">Romans 15:24-28</a>),--that was what he now proposed to himself. How different a path was actually marked out for him the sequel of the story shows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- Through</span> for <span class="accented">over</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When he had gone through</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>); see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>, note, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-6.htm">Luke 9:6</a>.

Macedonia and Achaia are always coupled together (see Tacit., 'Ann..' 1:76). as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:7, 8</a>. In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written from Macedonia, it is always Achaia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>, etc.). In fact, <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span> is found nowhere else in the New Testament, Achaia being the name of the Roman province. Bengel and others understand Hellas here of the country between Macedonia and the Peloponnesus, especially Attica; which would make it probable that St. Paul revisited Athens. But Meyer, Kuinoel, Alford, 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc., think it is synonymous with Achaia. There must, however, be some reason for this unusual use of Hellas instead of Achaia. None seems so likely as that it was meant to cover wider ground than Achaia would naturally indicate, namely Attica. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-6 Tumults or opposition may constrain a Christian to remove from his station or alter his purpose, but his work and his pleasure will be the same, wherever he goes. Paul thought it worth while to bestow five days in going to Troas, though it was but for seven days' stay there; but he knew, and so should we, how to redeem even journeying time, and to make it turn to some good account.</body></html>
