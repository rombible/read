It had had an analogous meaning in the ritual of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-23.htm" title="And he laid his hands on him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.">Numbers 27:23</a>) in acts of blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/48-13.htm" title="And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.">Genesis 48:13-14</a>) and the transmission of functions. Its primary symbolism would seem to be that of the concentration for the moment of all the spiritual energy of prayer upon him on whom men lay their hands; and so of the bestowal of any office for which spiritual gifts are required. It had been used in the Jewish schools on the admission of a scribe to his office as a teacher. It soon became the customary outward and visible sign of such bestowal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-3.htm" title="And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.">Acts 13:3</a>). Instruction as to what it thus meant entered into the primary teaching of all converts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>). It was connected with other acts that pre-supposed the communication of a spiritual gift (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1Timothy 5:22</a>). Through well-nigh all changes of polity and dogma and ritual, it has kept its place with Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, among the unchanging witnesses of the Church's universality and permanence, witnessing, as in Confirmation, to the diversity of spiritual gifts, and, as in Ordination, to their connection with every special office and administration in the Church of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them</span>. They did not pray without imposition of hands, nor did they lay hands on them without prayer. So in the sacraments, in confirmation, and ordination, the outward sign or rite is accompanied by prayer for the thing signified. And God's grace is given through the sacrament or rite in answer to the prayer of faith (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-15.htm">Acts 8:15</a>, and the Office for Baptism, the Prayer of Consecration in the Office for Holy Communion, and the Confirmation and Ordination Services). (For the laying on of hands as a mode of conveying a special grace and blessing, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-3.htm">Numbers 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm">Matthew 19:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm">Hebrews 6:2</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Hitherto the disciples had been of one accord; this often had been noticed to their honour; but now they were multiplied, they began to murmur. The word of God was enough to take up all the thoughts, cares, and time of the apostles. The persons chosen to serve tables must be duly qualified. They must be filled with gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, necessary to rightly managing this trust; men of truth, and hating covetousness. All who are employed in the service of the church, ought to be commended to the Divine grace by the prayers of the church. They blessed them in the name of the Lord. The word and grace of God are greatly magnified, when those are wrought upon by it, who were least likely.</body></html>
