These formed the true work of the Apostles, as afterwards of the bishops or elders of the Church. "Prayer" includes the public worship of the Church in all its various developments, as well as private prayer and intercession; the "ministry of the word," all forms of teaching.<p>It is to be noted that the men thus appointed are never called "deacons" in the New Testament. When they are referred to again it is as "the Seven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>), as though they were a distinct and peculiar body. Their functions were, of course, in some degree, analogous to those of the "deacons" of the Pastoral Epistles and the later organisation of the Church; but these, as we have seen, had their prototypes in the "young men," as contrasted with "elders," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-6.htm" title="And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.">Acts 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-10.htm" title="Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.">Acts 5:10</a>; and the Seven were probably appointed, so to speak, as <span class= "ital">archdeacons, </span>to superintend and guide them. In some churches, as at Rome, the number of deacons was fixed at seven, in conformity with this precedent (so also at the Council of Neo-Caesarea, <span class= "ital">Can.</span> 14, A.D. 314), and they were considered, when the bishop came to be distinguished from the elders, as acting more immediately under the direction of the former, helping him in the details of his office.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Continue steadfastly in</span> for <span class="accented">give ourselves continually</span> to, A.V.; <span class="accented">in</span> (the ministry) for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Steadfastly</span>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is of frequent use in the Acts (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>; 5:46; 8:13; x. 7; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>). It is used of persons and things to which any one adheres closely and perseveringly, which are put in the dative case, as here. But sometimes it has the prepositions <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> after it, as in Acts 5:46; Hist. of Susann. 7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a>. Ver. 5. <span class="accented">- Holy Spirit</span> for <span class="accented">Holy Ghost</span>, A.V. The mention of Stephen, and the narrative which follows leading up from Stephen's martyrdom to St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>), show to what the writer is tending. He selects the incidents in the history of the Church at Jerusalem which connect themselves most directly with that after history which was the object he had in view. It has been thought by some that the Greek character of all seven names is an indication that they were Hellenists. Such a conclusion, however, is not warranted, as many Jews who were not Hellenists had Greek or Latin names, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Paul, Sylvanus, Aquila, Priscilla, Marcus, Justus, Petrus, Didymus, etc. At the same time, it is likely that some of them were. One, Nicolas, was a proselyte. The object, doubtless, was to ensure perfect fairness of distribution of the Church charities. <span class="cmt_word">Stephen</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Philip</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5</a>, etc.; Acts 21:8) are the only two of whom we know anything beyond their names. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Hitherto the disciples had been of one accord; this often had been noticed to their honour; but now they were multiplied, they began to murmur. The word of God was enough to take up all the thoughts, cares, and time of the apostles. The persons chosen to serve tables must be duly qualified. They must be filled with gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, necessary to rightly managing this trust; men of truth, and hating covetousness. All who are employed in the service of the church, ought to be commended to the Divine grace by the prayers of the church. They blessed them in the name of the Lord. The word and grace of God are greatly magnified, when those are wrought upon by it, who were least likely.</body></html>
