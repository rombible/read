The length of the interval between this and the previous chapter is left uncertain. The death of Stephen is fixed by most writers in A.D. 38.<p><span class= "bld">The Grecians.</span>--The English version always carefully uses this word, and not Greeks, for the Hellenistae or Greek-speaking Jews. These were known also as "the dispersion among the Gentiles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>), or generally as "the dispersion," the "sojourners of the dispersion," those that were "scattered abroad" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>). Many of the converts of the Day of Pentecost must have belonged to this body; so, probably, did Barnabas and the others named in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-37.htm" title="Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.">Acts 4:37</a>. Now they were becoming a prominent section of the Church, perhaps more numerous than the Hebrews, or Jews of Palestine. They, as their name implies, spoke Greek habitually, and as a rule did not read the older Hebrew or speak the current Aramaic. They read the Septuagint (LXX.) version of the Old Testament. They were commonly more zealous, with the zeal of pilgrims, for the sanctity of the holy places than the Jews of Jerusalem itself, who had been familiar with them from infancy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-27.htm" title="And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,">Acts 21:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Because their widows were neglected.</span>--The words imply something like an organised administration of the common fund: widows and their children being the chief objects of relief. The rules of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-3.htm" title="Honor widows that are widows indeed.">1Timothy 5:3-16</a>, were probably the growth of a more mature experience; and here we have to think of a clamorous crowd of applicants besieging the house at which the Apostles held their meeting at the times appointed for giving relief in money, or, as seems more probable, in kind. The Twelve--singly, or in groups--sat at the table, and gave as they were able. It was like the dole of alms at the gate of a convent. Under such circumstances, jealousies and complaints were all but in- evitable. The Twelve were all of them Galileans, and were suspected of favouring the widows of Palestine rather than those of the Dispersion. It was the first sign that the new society was outgrowing its primitive organisation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Now in these</span> for <span class="accented">and in those</span>, A.V.

Of a similar form and meaning is the word "to Judaize," translated "to live as do the Jews" (A.V., <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>), and the forms "to Demosthenize," "to Platonize," "to Atticize," etc. The Hellenists were those Jews of the dispersion who lived in countries where Greek was spoken, and who themselves spoke Greek. It was for the sake of such that the Alexandrine Version of the Scriptures, commonly called the LXX., was made. <span class="cmt_word">Hebrews</span>; Palestinian and other Jews, who spoke Aramean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-21.htm">2 Corinthians 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-40.htm">Acts 21:40</a>), as opposed to the Hellenists. <span class="cmt_word">Their widows</span>. We learn incidentally by this phrase that one of the earliest Christian institutions was an order of widows, who were maintained at the common cost. We find them in the Church of Joppa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-41.htm">Acts 9:41</a>), and in the Church of Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3, 9, 10, 11, 16</a>).

The word of God was enough to take up all the thoughts, cares, and time of the apostles. The persons chosen to serve tables must be duly qualified. They must be filled with gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, necessary to rightly managing this trust; men of truth, and hating covetousness. All who are employed in the service of the church, ought to be commended to the Divine grace by the prayers of the church. They blessed them in the name of the Lord. The word and grace of God are greatly magnified, when those are wrought upon by it, who were least likely.</body></html>
