It would seem to the accusers a natural inference that He who had uttered the prediction should be the chief agent in its fulfilment.<p><span class= "bld">And shall change the customs.</span>--The words seem to have been used in a half-technical sense as including the whole complex system of the Mosaic law, its ritual, its symbolism, its laws and rules of life, circumcision, the Sabbath, the distinction of clean and unclean meats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm" title="And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.">Acts 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-3.htm" title="Especially because I know you to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: why I beseech you to hear me patiently.">Acts 26:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said to them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.">Acts 28:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Unto us for us, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We have heard him say</span>, etc. These false witnesses, like those who distorted our Lord's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>), doubtless based their accusation upon some semblance of truth. If Stephen had said anything like what Jesus said to the woman of Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>) or to his disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-2.htm">Mark 13:2</a>), or what the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews wrote (8. 13), or what St. Paul wrote to the Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16, 17</a>), his words might easily be misrepresented by false witnesses, whose purpose it was to swear away his life. <span class="cmt_word">This Jesus of Nazareth</span>. The phrase is most contemptuous. This (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), so often rendered in the A.V. "this fellow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61, 71</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-29.htm">John 9:29</a>, etc.), is of itself an opprobrious expression (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-40.htm">Acts 7:40</a>), and the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the Nazarene, is intended to be still more so. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-15 When they could not answer Stephen's arguments as a disputant, they prosecuted him as a criminal, and brought false witnesses against him. And it is next to a miracle of providence, that no greater number of religious persons have been murdered in the world, by the way of perjury and pretence of law, when so many thousands hate them, who make no conscience of false oaths. Wisdom and holiness make a man's face to shine, yet will not secure men from being treated badly. What shall we say of man, a rational being, yet attempting to uphold a religious system by false witness and murder! And this has been done in numberless instances. But the blame rests not so much upon the understanding, as upon the heart of a fallen creature, which is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Yet the servant of the Lord, possessing a clear conscience, cheerful hope, and Divine consolations, may smile in the midst of danger and death.</body></html>
