Possibly, however, the suggestion may have come from the <span class= "ital">Libertini</span>, or Hellenistae of Rome<span class= "ital">, </span>where there was a distinct guild, or <span class= "ital">Collegium, </span>known as the <span class= "ital">Septemviri Epulones, </span>or Seven Stewards (Lucan. i. 602), whose business it was to arrange for the banquets held in honour of the gods, which were more or less analogous to the Christian <span class= "ital">agap?, </span>on certain set days. (See Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities, </span>Art. "Epulones." It is an interesting coincidence that they, too, had been appointed to relieve the Pontifices from a duty which they found too heavy. This view falls in with the inference as to the Roman origin of Stephen which will be found in the Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom.</span>--The Apostles, it is clear, did not limit their thoughts of the Spirit's working to prophecy and the gift of tongues. Wherever wisdom, and charity, and kindness were requisite, there was need of a supernatural grace, raising men above prejudice and passion. Of these qualities, no less than of the good report, the whole body of believers were to be, in the first instance, the judges, the Apostles reserving to themselves the right of final appointment, and therefore, if necessary, of a veto. It is significant that the word "wisdom" only appears in the Acts in connection with Stephen (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-10.htm" title="And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.">Acts 6:10</a>, and in the report of his speech <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-10.htm" title="And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.">Acts 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-22.htm" title="And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.">Acts 7:22</a>). We may, perhaps, think of James, the brother of the Lord, as led by what he now saw and heard to that prayerful seeking after wisdom which is so prominent in his Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm" title="If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraides not; and it shall be given him.">James 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/3-13.htm" title="Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.">James 3:13-17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- Look ye out therefore, brethren, from</span> for <span class="accented">wherefore, brethren, look ye out</span>, A.V.; good for <span class="accented">honest</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Spirit</span> for <span class="accented">Holy Ghost</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">of wisdom</span> for <span class="accented">wisdom</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Good report</span>; literally, <span class="accented">borne witness to</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> well spoken cf.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-2.htm">Acts 16:2</a> Timothy is said to be "well reported of (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) by the brethren." <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit</span>. The number seven was, perhaps, fixed upon with reference to the exigencies of the service, some think because there were seven tables to be supplied; and partly perhaps from <span class="accented">seven</span> being the sacred number, the number of completeness - seven Churches, seven spirits, seven stars, seven children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>), seven times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-164.htm">Psalm 119:164</a>). From seven having been the number of the first deacons arose the custom in some Churches of always having seven deacons, which continued some centuries in the Church of Rome. One of the Canons of the Council of Neo-caesarea (An). 314) enacted that "there ought to be but seven deacons in any city," and St. Mark is said to have ordained seven deacons at Alexandria (see Bingham, 'Christ. Antia' vol. 1. p. 232). But the needs of the Churches gradually superseded all such restrictions. <span class="cmt_word">Whom we may appoint</span>. The multitude elect, the apostles appoint. The apostolate appears as <span class="accented">the sole</span> ministry of the Church at first. From the apostolate is evolved first the diaconate, afterwards the presbyterate, as the need for each arose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Hitherto the disciples had been of one accord; this often had been noticed to their honour; but now they were multiplied, they began to murmur. The word of God was enough to take up all the thoughts, cares, and time of the apostles. The persons chosen to serve tables must be duly qualified. They must be filled with gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, necessary to rightly managing this trust; men of truth, and hating covetousness. All who are employed in the service of the church, ought to be commended to the Divine grace by the prayers of the church. They blessed them in the name of the Lord. The word and grace of God are greatly magnified, when those are wrought upon by it, who were least likely.</body></html>
