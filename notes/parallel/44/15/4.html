The position of the Apostles, though in some degree analogous in their relation to the elders to the later office of bishops, was yet in many ways unique. They had no local diocese, but remained at Jerusalem, guiding the progress of the Church at large, as a kind of central council, calling in the "elders," or "presbyters," to consult with them, and submitting the result of their deliberations to the Church at large. The three bodies stood to each other as the <span class= "ital">Boule, </span>or council, the <span class= "ital">Gerusia, </span>or senate, and the <span class= "ital">Ecclesia, </span>or assembly, in a Greek republic.<p><span class= "bld">They declared all things that God had done with them.</span>--This obviously implied a narrative of considerable length: the history of acts and sufferings, of signs and wonders, of the fruits of the Spirit as seen in the purity, and truth, and love of the Gentile converts.

There is a strange proneness in us to think that all do wrong who do not just as we do. Their doctrine was very discouraging. Wise and good men desire to avoid contests and disputes as far as they can; yet when false teachers oppose the main truths of the gospel, or bring in hurtful doctrines, we must not decline to oppose them.</body></html>
