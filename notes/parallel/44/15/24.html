St. John, who was present at the Council (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>), and who, though he took no part in the debate, may well have had a share in drawing up the letter, uses a like mode of speech, "They went out from us, but they were not of us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm" title="They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.">1John 2:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Subverting your souls.</span>--The Greek verb, literally, <span class= "ital">turning upside down, </span>implies throwing into a state of excitement and agitation. The Gentiles had been "unsettled" by the teaching of the Judaisers.<p><span class= "bld">And keep the law.</span>--Assuming the Epistle of St. James to have been already written, there is something almost like a touch of irony in his repeating the phrase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">James 2:10</a>. The teachers who bade the Gentiles keep the Law were reminded in that Epistle that they, in their servile respect of persons, were breaking the Law deliberately in one point, and were therefore guilty of all. Putting the two passages together, they bring St. James before us as speaking in the very accents of St. Paul, "Thou, therefore, which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-21.htm" title="You therefore which teach another, teach you not yourself? you that preach a man should not steal, do you steal?">Romans 2:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To whom we gave no such commandment.</span>--The word "such" is a needless interpolation. What St. James declares is that the teachers had had no commission of any kind from him. The passage is important as throwing light on the nature of a later claim set up by the same party (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The words in the A.V. and the T.R., <span class="accented">saying, Ye must be circumcised and keep the Law</span>, are omitted in the R.T. and the <span class="accented">R.V.</span>; <span class="accented">commandment</span> for such <span class="accented">commandment</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The certain which went out from us</span> are the same as the "certain men" which "came down from Judaea," of ver. 1.

It is spoken properly of a person who moves and carries off all the goods and furniture from the house which he is quitting. Hence to "disturb," "throw into confusion, turn upside down," and the like. <span class="cmt_word">To whom we gave no commandment</span>. Observe the distinct disavowal by James of having authorized those who went forth from him and the Jerusalem Church to require the circumcision of the Gentiles. The A.V. expresses the meaning most clearly. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:22-35 Being warranted to declare themselves directed by the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, the apostles and disciples were assured that it seemed good unto God the Holy Spirit, as well as to them, to lay upon the converts no other burden than the things before mentioned, which were necessary, either on their own account, or from present circumstances. It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.</body></html>
