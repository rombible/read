(1) It was of the nature of a compromise. The Gentiles could not complain that the burden imposed on them was anything very grievous. The Pharisee section of the Church could not refuse admission to those who fulfilled these conditions, when they had admitted the proselytes of the gate on like conditions to their synagogues, and had so treated them as no longer unclean. (2) The rules on which stress was now laid found a place among the seven precepts traditionally ascribed to Noah, and based upon the commands recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5</a>. These were held to be binding upon all mankind; while the Law, as such, was binding on Israel only. These, therefore, had been thought sufficient for the proselytes of the gate before, and were urged now as sufficient for the Gentile converts by the teacher who represented the most rigid type of Judaism. (See, once more, the history of Ananias and Izates in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-10.htm" title="And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.">Acts 9:10</a>.) Special reasons attached, as will be seen, to each precept.<p><span class= "bld">From pollutions of idols.</span>--The Greek of the first noun is found only in the LXX. and the New Testament; and perhaps its primary idea is that of "wallowing" in blood and mire, and so incurring pollution. As distinguished from the acts that follow, it indicates any participation, publicly or privately, in idolatrous rites. One who acted on the rule would have to refrain from entering a temple, and to dislodge busts or statues of the gods from his house and gardens. The presence of such things, when they presented themselves on entering a house, was a great stumbling-block to devout Jews, and the Gentile convert who, left to himself, might have been disposed to keep them, though no longer as objects of worship, but as works of art, was required to renounce them. The statues of Zeus and Artemis and Hermes were to be to him henceforth as abominations. In the decree itself, however, we find "things sacrificed to idols" instead of the more general term, and we may accordingly deal here with that question also. So interpreted, the rule brings before us a new phase of the life of the early Christian converts. Under the religion of Greece and Rome, sacrifices were so common that it might fairly be taken for granted that the flesh at any festive meal had been so offered. But a small portion of the flesh was burnt upon the altar, and the rest was cooked for the household meal, or sent to the market for sale. Such meat was, in the eyes of the strict Jews, polluted, and the history of Daniel and his companions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-8.htm" title="But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.">Daniel 1:8</a>) was regarded as a precedent to avoiding it. Partly on this ground, partly on that referred to in the next Note but one, the Jew never bought meat in the market, nor of other than a Jewish butcher. He travelled with his <span class= "ital">cophinus, </span>or basket, <span class= "ital">on</span> his back, and carried his provisions with him. So Juvenal (<span class= "ital">Sat. iii.</span> 14) speaks of--<p>"Judaeis, quorum cophinus f?numque supellex."<p>["Basket, and wisp of straw to serve as pillow,--<p>That's the Jew's luggage."]<p>Here, therefore, was a new stumbling-block, and the Gentile was required to avoid this also. It involved many sacrifices, and what would seem privations. The convert had to refuse invitations to birthday, and marriage, and funeral feasts; or, if present, to refuse to eat at them. A man with a sensitive conscience would refuse to partake of what was set before him in a private house or offered for sale in the market, unless he had satisfied himself that it had not so been offered. It was natural that this restriction, which did not rest directly on a moral ground, should give rise to some resistance, and the controversy connected with it assumed many different phases. At Corinth men claimed the right to eat what they chose, and St. Paul conceded the right in the abstract, but urged abstinence on the ground of charity (1 Corinthians 8-10.). At Pergamos and Thyatira, somewhat later in the apostolic age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a>), the lawfulness of eating things sacrificed to idols was openly maintained in contravention alike of the teaching of St. Paul and of the apostolic decree, and was joined with a like claim to be exempted from the law which forbade illicit sexual intercourse. At Corinth, it would seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;">1Corinthians 8:10</a>, the assertion of freedom had led men so far as not only to eat of the flesh that had been sacrificed, but actually to sit down to a feast in the idol's temple. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-22.htm" title="You that say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you that abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?">Romans 2:22</a>, as expressing the Jewish feeling.)<p><span class= "bld">And from fornication.</span>--We are surprised at first to find, what seems to us, a moral law placed in juxtaposition with two rules which, like those that follow, seem purely positive and ceremonial. We have to remember, however, (1) that the first command was moral also, and that we may fairly recognise something like a practical, though not a formal distinction, by thinking of the first two precepts as grouped together; (2) that the sin named, involving, as it did, the absence of any true sense of self-respecting purity or reverence for womanhood, was the wide-spread evil of the ancient world, against which Israel had from the first been called to bear its witness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-31.htm" title="And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?">Genesis 34:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-29.htm" title="Do not prostitute your daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of wickedness.">Leviticus 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-17.htm" title="There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.">Deuteronomy 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/7-6.htm" title="For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,">Proverbs 7:6-27</a>). The increasing laxity of morals throughout the Roman empire, showing itself in the well-known line of Terence--<p>"Nihil peccati est adolescentulum scortari, "<p>had led men to think of it as natural and permissible, bringing with it no sense of wrong or shame (comp. Horace, <span class= "ital">Sat. i.</span> 2, 119), and it might well be that the ethical standard of the Gentile converts was not all at once raised to a true ideal of purity. The old license may have seemed venial, and the disciples may have thought, as Christians have too often thought since, that it did not call for any deep repentance, or exclude them from fellowship with Christ. And yet it was clear that to the Jewish Christian, trained from his childhood to condemn the sin severely, this, too, would legitimately be a very grave stumbling-block in the admission of Gentile converts. How could he feel any assurance that they might not have come from the embraces of a harlot to the Feast of Charity or to the very Supper of the Lord? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.">1Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a>.) Such a state of things required to be dealt with by a special enactment. The moral command had to be re-enacted, and brought into a new prominence. The Church had to take its first step in purifying the morals of mankind, not only by its general teaching, but by canons and rules of discipline. Stress has often been laid on the fact that in many cases, as in those of the <span class= "ital">Hetaerae?, </span>or harlot-priestesses, of Aphrodite at Corinth and Paphos, prostitution was in closest alliance with idolatry, as a reason for the prohibition, and it is, of course, true that in such cases the sin assumed, in the eyes of Jews, an aggravated character. The man identified himself, by his sinful indulgence, with the <span class= "ital">coltus</span> of the woman who was its avowed devotee. We can scarcely think, however, that the sin was forbidden, not on account of its own intrinsic evil, but only or chiefly, with a view to this ulterior and incidental consequence.<p><span class= "bld">Things strangled.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of that which has been strangled.</span> The prohibition rested on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm" title="But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not eat.">Genesis 9:4</a>, and was connected with the symbolic meaning of the blood as representing life, and therefore consecrated to Jehovah. It was repeated in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-17.htm" title="It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that you eat neither fat nor blood.">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-26.htm" title="Moreover you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.">Leviticus 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-16.htm" title="Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth as water.">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-33.htm" title="Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, You have transgressed: roll a great stone to me this day.">1Samuel 14:33</a>), and has been maintained with a wonderful tenacity. For this reason, long after sacrifices have ceased, the Jew will still, if possible, only eat what has been killed by a butcher of his own persuasion. Meat so killed, which may be eaten without defilement, is known technically as <span class= "ital">Kosher.</span> Here the moral element falls entirely into the background, and the prohibition has simply the character of a <span class= "ital">concordat</span> to avoid offence. St. Paul and St. Peter were alike persuaded that "there is nothing unclean of itself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-15.htm" title="And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-14.htm" title="I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.">Romans 14:14</a>). Practically, the effect of the rule would have been to compel Christians to buy their meat, poultry, &c., from a Jewish butcher or a Christian who followed the Jewish mode of killing, and in some places this must have entailed considerable inconvenience.<p><span class= "bld">From blood.</span>--As distinguished from the preceding rule, this forbade the separate use of blood, as with flour and vegetables, or in the black-puddings of modern cookery, as an article of food. Dishes so prepared were common in the <span class= "ital">cuisine</span> both of Greeks and Romans, and here also, therefore, the restriction would have involved a frequent withdrawal from social life, or a conspicuous singularity. On the history of the observance, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm" title="For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things;">Acts 15:28</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> <span class="accented">- The pollutions</span> for <span class="accented">pollutions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">what is strangled</span> for <span class="accented">things strangled</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The pollutions</span>. In the decree itself (ver. 29) this is explained by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, things offered to idols, though some apply the "pollutions" to all the things here mentioned, not the idols only. Later St. Paul somewhat enlarged the liberty of Gentile converts in respect to meats offered to idols (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-25.htm">1 Corinthians 10:25-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What is strangled</span>, etc. The things forbidden are all practices not looked upon as sins by Gentiles, but now enjoined upon them as portions of the Law of Moses which were to be binding upon them, at least for a time, with a view to their living in communion and fellowship with their Jewish brethren. The necessity for some of the prohibitions would cease when the condition of the Church as regards Jews and Gentiles was altered; others were of eternal obligation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:7-21 We see from the words purifying their hearts by faith, and the address of St. Peter, that justification by faith, and sanctification by the Holy Ghost, cannot be separated; and that both are the gift of God. We have great cause to bless God that we have heard the gospel. May we have that faith which the great Searcher of hearts approves, and attests by the seal of the Holy Spirit. Then our hearts and consciences will be purified from the guilt of sin, and we shall be freed from the burdens some try to lay upon the disciples of Christ. Paul and Barnabas showed by plain matters of fact, that God owned the preaching of the pure gospel to the Gentiles without the law of Moses; therefore to press that law upon them, was to undo what God had done. The opinion of James was, that the Gentile converts ought not to be troubled about Jewish rites, but that they should abstain from meats offered to idols, so that they might show their hatred of idolatry. Also, that they should be cautioned against fornication, which was not abhorred by the Gentiles as it should be, and even formed a part of some of their rites. They were counselled to abstain from things strangled, and from eating blood; this was forbidden by the law of Moses, and also here, from reverence to the blood of the sacrifices, which being then still offered, it would needlessly grieve the Jewish converts, and further prejudice the unconverted Jews. But as the reason has long ceased, we are left free in this, as in the like matters. Let converts be warned to avoid all appearances of the evils which they formerly practised, or are likely to be tempted to; and caution them to use Christian liberty with moderation and prudence.</body></html>
