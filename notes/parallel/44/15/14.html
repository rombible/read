The use of the old Hebrew form of the Apostle's name, instead of the more familiar Simon, was natural in the Galilean speaker, and is presumptive evidence in favour of our having a report from notes made at the time.<p><span class= "bld">Did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people.</span>--The two words present an emphatic contrast. The Jews claimed for themselves the exclusive right to the latter term. They alone were the "people," the rest of mankind were the "nations"--the "heathen." St. James proclaims that out of those heathen nations a people had been taken who were as truly God's people as Israel had ever been. He, too, recognises the change as fully as St. Paul does, when in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-26.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.">Romans 9:26</a> he quotes the memorable prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>. St. James as well as St. Peter had, it is clear, profited by the private teaching referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- Symeon</span> for <span class="accented">Simeon</span>, A.V.; re<span class="accented">hearsed</span> for <span class="accented">declared</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">first God</span> for <span class="accented">God at the first</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Symeon</span>. This is the only place (unless <span class="accented">Symeon</span> is the right reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>) in which Simon Peter's name is given in this Hebrew form, which is most proper in the month of James speaking to Palestine Jews. Singularly enough, Chrysostom was misled by it, and thought the prophecy of Simeon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a> was meant, <span class="cmt_word">How first</span>; corresponding to the" good while ago" of ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">Did visit</span>, etc. The construction <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is very unusual, and indeed stands alone. The verb always has an accusative case after it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>), unless <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a> is an exception, which, however, it hardly is. There are two ways of construing the phrase. One is to consider it as elliptical, and to supply, as the A.V. and R.V. do, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>. So Alford, who compares the construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-25.htm">Luke 1:25</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span> must be supplied. But this is a harsh construction. The other and better way is to take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not in the sense of" visiting," but of" looking out," or "endeavoring to find something." The sense of the infinitive after the verb is nearly equivalent to" look out for and took," literally, <span class="accented">looked out how he might take.</span> With a slight modification of meaning, Irenaeus (in 'Speaker's Commentary') renders it" Excogitavit accipere," "planned" or "contrived to take." <span class="cmt_word">A people for his Name</span>; 1.<span class="accented">e.</span> to be called by his Name. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> was the peculiar designation of "the people" of God, answering to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:7-21 We see from the words purifying their hearts by faith, and the address of St. Peter, that justification by faith, and sanctification by the Holy Ghost, cannot be separated; and that both are the gift of God. We have great cause to bless God that we have heard the gospel. May we have that faith which the great Searcher of hearts approves, and attests by the seal of the Holy Spirit. Then our hearts and consciences will be purified from the guilt of sin, and we shall be freed from the burdens some try to lay upon the disciples of Christ. Paul and Barnabas showed by plain matters of fact, that God owned the preaching of the pure gospel to the Gentiles without the law of Moses; therefore to press that law upon them, was to undo what God had done. The opinion of James was, that the Gentile converts ought not to be troubled about Jewish rites, but that they should abstain from meats offered to idols, so that they might show their hatred of idolatry. Also, that they should be cautioned against fornication, which was not abhorred by the Gentiles as it should be, and even formed a part of some of their rites. They were counselled to abstain from things strangled, and from eating blood; this was forbidden by the law of Moses, and also here, from reverence to the blood of the sacrifices, which being then still offered, it would needlessly grieve the Jewish converts, and further prejudice the unconverted Jews. But as the reason has long ceased, we are left free in this, as in the like matters. Let converts be warned to avoid all appearances of the evils which they formerly practised, or are likely to be tempted to; and caution them to use Christian liberty with moderation and prudence.</body></html>
