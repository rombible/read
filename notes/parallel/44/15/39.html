The warmth of previous affection, of a friendship begun probably in boyhood, and cemented by new hopes, and a great work in which both were sharers, made the breach between the two more painful. At this stage, both Barnabas and Mark disappear from the history of the Acts, but it will be worth while to note the chief facts in the after-history of each. (1) Probably Barnabas and Paul met again in the visit of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a>, unless, indeed, we refer the incidents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11-13</a> to an earlier period, and then there was a yet further cause of division in his yielding to the dissimulation of the Judaising teachers. (2) In writing to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1Corinthians 9:6</a>) the Apostle names Barnabas as setting the same noble example as himself in labouring with his own hands and accepting nothing from the churches. (3) On the later life of Mark see the <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Mark's Gospel.</span> Here it will be sufficient to note that the discipline did its work. After labouring with his cousin in Cyprus, he appears to have returned to St. Peter, as his first father in the faith, and to have been with him at Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>). He and St. Paul met during the latter's first imprisonment at Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>), and the Apostle learnt to recognise in him one who was "profitable to him for the ministry" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2Timothy 4:11</a>), and whom he wished to have with him at the last.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - There <span class="accented">arose a sharp contention</span> for <span class="accented">the contention was so sharp between them</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">parted</span> for <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">so that</span> for <span class="accented">so sharp</span>... <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and Barnabas</span> for <span class="accented">and so Barnabas</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">took Mark with him</span> for <span class="accented">took Mark</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sailed away</span> for <span class="accented">sailed</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">There arose a sharp contention</span>, etc. The sense "between them" must be supplied, if the English word "contention" is used. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> only occurs twice in the New Testament: once in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>, in a good sense, "To provoke" (for a provocation) - " stimulate or excite" - " unto love and good works," which is its common classical sense; the other time in this passage, where the sense is attributed to it in which it is used in the LXX., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-28.htm">Deuteronomy 29:28</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, "in great indignation;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a> (39. 37, LXX.), coupled with the same words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, "in great wrath;" answering to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span>in Hebrew. But it is more probable that St. <span class="accented">Luke</span> uses the word here in its common medical sense. In medical writers - Galen, Hippocrates, etc. - the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is equivalent to what we call <span class="accented">an access</span>, from the Latin <span class="accented">aecessio</span>, used by Celsus, when a disease of some standing takes a turn for the worse, comes to a height, and breaks out into its severest form. This is the sense in which our English word "paroxysm" is used. The meaning of the passage will then be that, after a good deal of uncomfortable feeling and discussion, the difference between Paul and Barnabas, instead of cooling down, broke out into such an acute form that Barnabas went off to Cyprus with Mark, leaving St. Paul to do what he pleased by himself. <span class="cmt_word">And Barnabas</span>, etc. The R.V. is much more accurate. The consequence of the quarrel is said by St. Luke to have been that Barnabas took Mark off with him to Cyprus. The statement that Paul chose Silas is a separate and independent statement, as appears by <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in the nominative) and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in the indicative mood. St. Luke's narrative quite sides with St. Paul, and throws the blame of the quarrel, or at least of the separation, upon Barnabas. Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 119) thinks St. Paul was too severe upon John Mark, and that it was ungrateful of him to break with one to whom he owed so much as he did to Barnabas for any cause of secondary importance. He also thinks that the real root of the quarrel lay in the constantly changing relations between the two apostles, aggravated by a domineering spirit in St. Paul. But the force of this censure turns upon the question whether it was a cause of <span class="accented">secondary</span> importance. If St. Paul had a single eye to the success of his mission, and judged that Mark would be a hindrance to it, it was a question <span class="accented">of primary</span> importance to "the work," and St. Paul was right. Renan also remarks upon the extinction of the fame of Barnabas consequent upon this separation from his more illustrious companion. "While Paul kept advancing to the heights of his glory, Barnabas, separated from the companion who had shed a portion of his own luster upon him, pursued his solitary course in obscurity." <span class="cmt_word">Sailed away</span>. Cyprus was Barnabas's native country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), and the scene of the earliest mission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>), and of Paul and Barnabas's first joint evangelistic labors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a>). Barnabas would have many friends there, and could form plans at his leisure for his future action. The friendly mention of him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a> shows both that he continued his disinterested labors as an apostle and that the estrangement between him and St. Paul had passed away. The <span class="accented">paroxysm</span> had yielded to the gentle treatment of charity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:36-41 Here we have a private quarrel between two ministers, no less than Paul and Barnabas, yet made to end well. Barnabas wished his nephew John Mark to go with them. We should suspect ourselves of being partial, and guard against this in putting our relations forward. Paul did not think him worthy of the honour, nor fit for the service, who had departed from them without their knowledge, or without their consent: see ch.</body></html>
