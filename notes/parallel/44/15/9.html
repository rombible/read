In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm" title="For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all that call on him.">Romans 10:12</a> we have almost the very words of St. Peter reproduced.<p><span class= "bld">Purifying their hearts by faith.</span>--The addition of these words is very suggestive. It was not only in the "gifts" of the Spirit, the tongues and prophecy, that the Apostle saw the witness which God had borne to the acceptance of the Gentiles, but even more than this, in the new purity growing out of a new faith in God and a new hope. Underlying the words we trace the assertion of a higher ideal of purity than that on which the Pharisees were insisting. They looked on the Gentiles as impure because they did not observe the ceremonial law and the traditions of the elders as to purity. He had learnt to call no man common or unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>) and to see that it was in the heart, and not in the flesh, that the work of purifying was to be accomplished. Comp. in connection with the thought suggested in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>, the teaching as to purity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-15.htm" title="To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.">Titus 1:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- He made no distinction</span> for <span class="accented">put no difference</span>, A.V.

This is exactly the doctrine of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-30.htm">Romans 3:30</a>, with which compare also ver. 11. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:7-21 We see from the words purifying their hearts by faith, and the address of St. Peter, that justification by faith, and sanctification by the Holy Ghost, cannot be separated; and that both are the gift of God. We have great cause to bless God that we have heard the gospel. May we have that faith which the great Searcher of hearts approves, and attests by the seal of the Holy Spirit. Then our hearts and consciences will be purified from the guilt of sin, and we shall be freed from the burdens some try to lay upon the disciples of Christ. Paul and Barnabas showed by plain matters of fact, that God owned the preaching of the pure gospel to the Gentiles without the law of Moses; therefore to press that law upon them, was to undo what God had done. The opinion of James was, that the Gentile converts ought not to be troubled about Jewish rites, but that they should abstain from meats offered to idols, so that they might show their hatred of idolatry. Also, that they should be cautioned against fornication, which was not abhorred by the Gentiles as it should be, and even formed a part of some of their rites. They were counselled to abstain from things strangled, and from eating blood; this was forbidden by the law of Moses, and also here, from reverence to the blood of the sacrifices, which being then still offered, it would needlessly grieve the Jewish converts, and further prejudice the unconverted Jews. But as the reason has long ceased, we are left free in this, as in the like matters. Let converts be warned to avoid all appearances of the evils which they formerly practised, or are likely to be tempted to; and caution them to use Christian liberty with moderation and prudence.</body></html>
