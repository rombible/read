If they concurred in the letter, it must have been submitted to their approval, and the right to approve involves the power to reject and, probably, to modify. It is probable enough, as in the analogous constitution of Greek republics above referred to (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-4.htm" title="And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.">Acts 15:4</a>), that the Ecclesia, or popular assembly, did not possess the power of initiating measures; but their right to vote appears, from this instance, to have been indisputable. (See, however, Note on the next verse.) It does not follow, of course, that what was thus the polity of the apostolic age was necessarily adapted for the Church of all subsequent ages; but the exclusion of the laity from all share in Church synods, though it may be defended as a safeguard against the violence of a barbarous or faithless age, must, at any rate, be admitted to be at variance with primitive and apostolic practice.<p><span class= "bld">To send chosen men.</span>--Literally, the participle being active in meaning, <span class= "ital">to choose and send men.</span> This was obviously necessary, to guard against suspicion. Had Paul and Barnabas alone been the bearers of such a letter, it might have been said that they had forged it.<p><span class= "bld">Judas surnamed Barsabas.</span>--The same patronymic meets us, it will be remembered, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-23.htm" title="And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.">Acts 1:23</a>, as belonging to "Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus." It is a natural inference that the two were brothers, and therefore that the disciple now mentioned had been among those who were personally followers of our Lord. This would naturally clothe him with a high authority. The fact that he is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a> as a prophet, makes it probable that he was of the number of the Seventy. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Silas.</span>--This may have been either a contracted form of Silvanus, as Antipas was of Antipatros, or an Aramaic name, for which Silvanus was adopted as the nearest Greek equivalent. It is probable that he, too, fulfilled the same conditions as his companion. He also was a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a>). His later history will be noticed as it comes before us. As the name is connected with the Hebrew for "three," he has by some been identified with the Tertius of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>; but it is hardly probable that one who had been known at Corinth as Silvanus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2Corinthians 1:19</a>), should afterwards have changed his name.<p><span class= "bld">Chief men among the brethren.</span>--The title thus given is the same as "those that bear rule over you," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm" title="Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.">Hebrews 13:17</a>, and implies that they had a position of greater authority than the other elders, as at least <span class= "ital">primi inter pares.</span> This also falls in with the view that they had been disciples of Christ, who, as the number of witnesses diminished, came more and more into prominence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="accented">It</span> <span class="accented">seemed good to</span> for <span class="accented">pleased it</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the elders</span> for <span class="accented">elders</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to choose men out of their company and send them, etc.</span>, for to <span class="accented">send chosen men of their own company</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Barsabbas</span> for <span class="accented">Barsabas</span>, A.V. and T.R., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To choose men</span>, etc. This is a necessary, change, because the middle aorist (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) cannot have a passive meaning (chosen); see ver. 40. <span class="cmt_word">Chief men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">leaders.</span> So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-26.htm">Luke 22:26</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is rendered, "He that is chief."

Going as direct emissaries from James and the Church of Jerusalem, and Judas would have great weight with the Jews in Syria and Cilicia. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:22-35 Being warranted to declare themselves directed by the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, the apostles and disciples were assured that it seemed good unto God the Holy Spirit, as well as to them, to lay upon the converts no other burden than the things before mentioned, which were necessary, either on their own account, or from present circumstances. It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.</body></html>
