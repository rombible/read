The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (from which comes the substantive <span class="accented">apostasy</span>) is a strong one, and denotes decided blame, as does the indication of the opposite course, by way of contrast, which he did not take. "He did not go with them to <span class="accented">the work"</span> to which God called them, as he ought to have done. The whole phrase, too, which follows is strongly worded. "Paul thought good," as regards one who had turned back from the work, "not <span class="accented">to take</span> that man." The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 38 is, as Meyer observes, sharply opposed to the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 37. Luke evidently sides strongly with Paul, and almost reproduces the <span class="accented">ipsis-sima verba</span> of the "sharp contention." One would infer that this passage was penned by Luke before the reconciliation which appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>, and that we have here an indication of the early date of the publication of "The Acts." Perhaps also there is an indication in the narrative, coupled with Mark's subsequent attach-merit to Peter, that Mark rather leant at this time to Judaizing views, and that his previous departure "from the work" was partly owing to a want of complete sympathy with St. Paul's doctrine. St. Paul would have no half-hearted helper in his grand and arduous work. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:36-41 Here we have a private quarrel between two ministers, no less than Paul and Barnabas, yet made to end well. Barnabas wished his nephew John Mark to go with them. We should suspect ourselves of being partial, and guard against this in putting our relations forward. Paul did not think him worthy of the honour, nor fit for the service, who had departed from them without their knowledge, or without their consent: see ch.</body></html>
