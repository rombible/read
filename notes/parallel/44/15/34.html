It seems to have been put in to explain ver. 40. But Silas may have returned to Jerusalem, as stated in ver. 33, and come back again to Antioch, from having formed a strong attachment to St. Paul and his views. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:22-35 Being warranted to declare themselves directed by the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, the apostles and disciples were assured that it seemed good unto God the Holy Spirit, as well as to them, to lay upon the converts no other burden than the things before mentioned, which were necessary, either on their own account, or from present circumstances. It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.</body></html>
