This was the chief end to which the gift of prophecy was directed. The two teachers thus showed that they had not come only as formal representatives of the Church in Jerusalem, but took a personal interest in the work. Their work was the very reverse of those who had previously come from Judaea "subverting the souls of the disciples" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:">Acts 15:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">- Being themselves also prophets</span> for <span class="accented">being prophets also themselves</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Being themselves also prophets</span>, exhorted, etc. Observe the connection of exhortation with prophecy, and compare the explanation of the name of Barnabas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Confirmed them</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, as ver. 41 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>. Nothing is so unsettling as controversy; but the preaching of these "chief men" brought back men's minds to the solid faith and hope of the gospel. How rich the Church of Antioch was at this time, with Paul and Barnabas, Judas and Silas, and probably Titus, and some, if not all, of those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>, for their teachers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:22-35 Being warranted to declare themselves directed by the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, the apostles and disciples were assured that it seemed good unto God the Holy Spirit, as well as to them, to lay upon the converts no other burden than the things before mentioned, which were necessary, either on their own account, or from present circumstances. It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.</body></html>
