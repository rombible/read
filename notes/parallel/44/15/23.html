Such a mode of speech, however, is foreign to the usage of the New Testament, and it is probable that this reading originated in a desire to bring the text into harmony with the later practice of the Church, which excluded the laity from all participation in its synods. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Send greeting.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">wish joy.</span> The formula was common in Greek epistles, but is not used in the New Testament, except here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a>. As it is reasonable to suppose that this letter was written or dictated by him, its occurrence is <span class= "ital">prima facie</span> evidence of the authorship of the Epistle that bears his name, and which, on the view taken in these Notes, had been already written to the Church of the Circumcision.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles.</span>--The letter was therefore addressed to them exclusively (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-20.htm" title="But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.">Acts 15:20</a>), as the Epistle of St. James had probably been previously addressed to the Jews of the "dispersion," and not to the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">In Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</span>--The mention of the latter country is important as showing the extent of St. Paul's work there prior to his joining Barnabas at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-25.htm" title="Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:">Acts 11:25</a>).

It is remarkable that the only other place in the New Testament where this Greek salutation occurs is <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:22-35 Being warranted to declare themselves directed by the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, the apostles and disciples were assured that it seemed good unto God the Holy Spirit, as well as to them, to lay upon the converts no other burden than the things before mentioned, which were necessary, either on their own account, or from present circumstances. It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.</body></html>
