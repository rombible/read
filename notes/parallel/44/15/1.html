It might have seemed as if the conversion of Cornelius had been accepted as deciding the question which we now find raised again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm" title="When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance to life.">Acts 11:18</a>). It would seem, however, that those who had raised objections to Peter's conduct in that case were not content to accept the conclusion which he drew from it, and it is not difficult to represent to ourselves the train of thought which led them to take a different view. To them it may have seemed the exception that proved the rule. Where signs and wonders came in, they may have been content to accept an uncircumcised convert as a member of the Church, simply on the ground that God had dispensed in such cases with His own law; or they may have urged that though, in such cases, they did not require circumcision as a condition of admission, the continuance in the uncircumcised state after baptism was a wilful transgression, which shut men out from the "salvation" which they were seeking. Circumcision, they may have said, had been given as an "everlasting covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm" title="He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.">Genesis 17:13</a>), and had never been formally abrogated. Who were the new teachers, that they should change what God had thus established? It is clear that they came, claiming to speak in the name of James, the Bishop of Jerusalem, and though he distinctly repudiates having authorised them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:">Acts 15:24</a>), yet if we suppose, as is probable, that his Epistle was written shortly before the Council, we can easily understand that they might rest their case on the words which he had used in it, that "whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">James 2:10</a>). Here, they might say, is a point confessedly in the Law, and even prior to it; and they were not prepared to draw the distinctions which we have learned to draw between the positive and the moral, the transient and the permanent, obligations of that Law. And it is to be noted that they did not merely make circumcision a condition of church communion; they carried their principles to their logical conclusion--as mediaeval dogmatism did in the case of baptism--and excluded the uncircumcised from all hope of salvation. (Comp. the account of Ananias and Izates given in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-10.htm" title="And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.">Acts 9:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Came down... and taught</span> for <span class="accented">which came down</span>... <span class="accented">taught</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">saying</span> for <span class="accented">and said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">custom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) for <span class="accented">manner</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Except ye be circumcised</span>, etc. The question thus raised nearly effected the disruption of the Church, and was the most serious controversy that had yet arisen. If the views broached by these Judaean Christians had prevailed, the whole character of Christianity would have been changed, and its existence probably cut short. How great the danger was appears from even Peter and Barnabas having wavered in their opinion. (For St. Paul's treatment of the subject, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>, etc.; 4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12-15</a>, etc.) The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is so like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> as to suggest very strongly the consideration whether Peter was not at Antioch at this time, and whether the scene related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, etc., did not precede, and in fact cause, the Council of Jerusalem. In this case the "dissension and disputation" spoken of in ver. 2 would include and directly point to the memorable rebuke given by Paul to Peter; and we should understand that Peter, accepting Paul's rebuke, preceded him and Barnabas, and prepared the way at Jerusalem for the solution arrived at. And, indeed, Peter's words at Jerusalem are almost an echo of Paul's words addressed to him at Antioch. If Barnabas had shown a leaning towards the Judaizing party, he would the more readily have been accepted by them as one of the embassy. The chief objection to this hypothesis is that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a> Peter's visit to Antioch seems to be spoken of as something subsequent to the journey of St. Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem. But it is not in the least necessary so to understand it. St, Paul's mention of his visit to Jerusalem might naturally recall the incident which had led to it, and which was another example of his own independence. Farrar places Peter's visit to Antioch between the Council of Jerusalem and the quarrel with Barnabas, in the time indicated in ver. 35 of this chapter (vol. 1. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23.htm">Acts 23</a>.), and so do Conybeare and Howson (vol. 1. p. 238), Meyer, and Alford ('Proleg.,' p. 24; note on Acts 15:36, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>). Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 290, etc.) and Lewin (vol. 1. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>.) place it after St. Paul's return to Antioch, at the conclusion of his second missionary journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22, 23</a>). No absolute certainty can be arrived at, but see note to ver. 35. <span class="cmt_word">Custom</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-21.htm">Acts 16:21</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is the technical term for the Mosaic institutions, used by Josephus and Philo (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-6 Some from Judea taught the Gentile converts at Antioch, that they could not be saved, unless they observed the whole ceremonial law as given by Moses; and thus they sought to destroy Christian liberty. There is a strange proneness in us to think that all do wrong who do not just as we do. Their doctrine was very discouraging. Wise and good men desire to avoid contests and disputes as far as they can; yet when false teachers oppose the main truths of the gospel, or bring in hurtful doctrines, we must not decline to oppose them.</body></html>
