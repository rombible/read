Light is thrown on the character of the debate by St. Paul's account of the matter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2-10</a>. He did not even then bring out what he held and taught, in its fulness. He shrank from startling and offending the prejudices of his countrymen, and was content to argue that circumcision and the Law were not binding upon the Gentiles, to press the precedent of the case of Cornelius and the analogy of the proselytes of the gate. Privately, in interviews with Peter, James, and John, he had gone further, and had declared his convictions that for Jew and Gentile alike circumcision and the Law were hindrances, and not helps, to the spiritual life, and that faith working by love was everything. And they, as the history of the Council and yet more their Epistles show, accepted his teaching. Of all doctrines as to the development of the Christian Church that which sees in Peter, James, and John the leaders of a Judaising anti-Pauline party is, perhaps, the most baseless and fantastic. The fact that their names were unscrupulously used by that party, both in their lifetime and, as the Pseudo-Clementine <span class= "ital">Homilies</span> and <span class= "ital">Recognitions</span> show, after their death, cannot outweigh their own deliberate words and acts.<p><span class= "bld">Peter rose up, and said unto them.</span>--The position of the Apostle is one of authority, but not of primacy. He does not preside, nor even propose, as we should say, a definite canon or resolution. His authority is that of personal and moral influence, that of a <span class= "ital">vir pietate gravis, </span>but nothing more.<p><span class= "bld">Men and brethren.</span>--Better, as before, <span class= "ital">Brethren</span> only, and so again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-13.htm" title="And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brothers, listen to me:">Acts 15:13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Ye know how that a good while ago . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of ancient days.</span> Ten or twelve years had passed since the conversion of Cornelius. Where Peter had been in the meantime, and what he had done, we have no record. We can hardly believe, as the Romish theory implies, that he came from the imperial city to attend the Council. It will be noted, as has been said before (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>), that the Apostle speaks of this as having been the first admission of the Gentiles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- Questioning</span> for <span class="accented">disputing</span>, A.V., as in ver. 2; <span class="accented">brethren</span> for men <span class="accented">and</span> brethren, A.V., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>, etc.; you for us, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">by my mouth the Gentiles</span> for the <span class="accented">Gentiles by my mouth</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Questioning</span>. It was a repetition of the same scene that took place at Antioch. <span class="cmt_word">Peter</span>, etc. It seems to have been wise on Peter's part to allow the meeting to exhaust itself by fruitless disputations before he rose to speak. His rising, with all the authority of his person and position, commanded immediate attention. <span class="cmt_word">A good while ago</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from ancient days</span>, or still more exactly, from <span class="accented">the days of the beginning</span> of the gospel (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), days belonging to the beginning (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>) of the Church's existence, and dating far back in Peter's own apostolic life. Nothing can be more natural than this allusion to the conversion of Cornelius, and the gift of the Holy Ghost to the Gentile inmates of his house, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:7-21 We see from the words purifying their hearts by faith, and the address of St. Peter, that justification by faith, and sanctification by the Holy Ghost, cannot be separated; and that both are the gift of God. We have great cause to bless God that we have heard the gospel. May we have that faith which the great Searcher of hearts approves, and attests by the seal of the Holy Spirit. Then our hearts and consciences will be purified from the guilt of sin, and we shall be freed from the burdens some try to lay upon the disciples of Christ. Paul and Barnabas showed by plain matters of fact, that God owned the preaching of the pure gospel to the Gentiles without the law of Moses; therefore to press that law upon them, was to undo what God had done. The opinion of James was, that the Gentile converts ought not to be troubled about Jewish rites, but that they should abstain from meats offered to idols, so that they might show their hatred of idolatry. Also, that they should be cautioned against fornication, which was not abhorred by the Gentiles as it should be, and even formed a part of some of their rites. They were counselled to abstain from things strangled, and from eating blood; this was forbidden by the law of Moses, and also here, from reverence to the blood of the sacrifices, which being then still offered, it would needlessly grieve the Jewish converts, and further prejudice the unconverted Jews. But as the reason has long ceased, we are left free in this, as in the like matters. Let converts be warned to avoid all appearances of the evils which they formerly practised, or are likely to be tempted to; and caution them to use Christian liberty with moderation and prudence.</body></html>
