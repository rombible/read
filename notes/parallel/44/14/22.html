In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>, the word is so rendered. It is not the same as that used by later writers for the ecclesiastical rite of Confirmation.<p><span class= "bld">Exhorting them to continue in the faith.</span>--The question meets us whether "faith" is used in its subjective sense, the "feeling of trust," or objectively, as including the main substance of what was believed and taught--"a belief or creed." That the latter meaning had become established a few years after St. Luke wrote, we see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1Timothy 5:8</a>; Jude <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-3.htm" title="Long time therefore stayed they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.">Acts 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-20.htm" title="However,, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.">Acts 14:20</a>; and on the whole it seems probable that it is so used here.<p><span class= "bld">And that we must through much tribulation.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">through many tribulations.</span> The use of the first personal pronoun is suggestive. Is St. Luke generalising what he heard from those who had listened to St. Paul, and giving it in their very words? Was he himself one of those listeners? The two had clearly met before we find them both at Troas; and on the supposition suggested in the last question, the apparently casual use of the pronoun would be analogous to what we find afterwards. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm" title="And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel to them.">Acts 16:10</a>.) In St. Paul's latest Epistle to the chosen disciple of Lystra we have a touching reproduction of this teaching. He speaks of the afflictions which came on him at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, and adds the general truth that "all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.">2Timothy 3:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The kingdom of God.</span>--We may pause to note the occurrence of the familiar phrase and thought of the Gospels in the earliest recorded teaching of St. Paul. In his Epistles it recurs frequently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-20.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.">1Corinthians 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,">1Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers to the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.">Colossians 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:">2Thessalonians 1:5</a>). For him, too, that which was proclaimed was not a theory or an opinion, but an actual kingdom, of which Jesus the Christ was king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhorting</span> for <span class="accented">and exhorting</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through many tribulations we must</span> for <span class="accented">we must through much tribulation</span>, A.V. St. Paul spoke from his own experience: "In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>; see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10-12</a>). It is very touching to see the tender care of the apostles for the young converts, lest they should fall away in time of persecution (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1, 5, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8-10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:19-28 See how restless the rage of the Jews was against the gospel of Christ. The people stoned Paul, in a popular tumult. So strong is the bent of the corrupt and carnal heart, that as it is with great difficulty that men are kept back from evil on one side, so it is with great ease they are persuaded to evil on the other side. If Paul would have been Mercury, he might have been worshipped; but if he will be a faithful minister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and thrown out of the city. Thus men who easily submit to strong delusions, hate to receive the truth in the love of it. All who are converted need to be confirmed in the faith; all who are planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work is to establish saints as well as to awaken sinners. The grace of God, and nothing less, effectually establishes the souls of the disciples. It is true, we must count upon much tribulation, but it is encouragement that we shall not be lost and perish in it. The Person to whose power and grace the converts and the newly-established churches are commended, clearly was the Lord Jesus, on whom they had believed. It was an act of worship. The praise of all the little good we do at any time, must be ascribed to God; for it is He who not only worketh in us both to will and to do, but also worketh with us to make what we do successful. All who love the Lord Jesus, will rejoice to hear that he has opened the door of faith wide, to those who were strangers to him and to his salvation. And let us, like the apostles, abide with those who know and love the Lord.</body></html>
