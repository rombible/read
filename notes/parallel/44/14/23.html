It is interesting here to note (1) that Paul and Barnabas, by virtue of the authority which as Apostles they had received, primarily from Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>) and mediately from the Church of Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-3.htm" title="And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.">Acts 13:3</a>), exercised the right of appointing, or, in later phrase, ordaining elders. (2) They plant among the Churches of the Gentiles the organisation which we have found in that of Jerusalem, and which was itself based on that of the Synagogue, not on that of the Temple. (3) As this appears as the first appointment, it would seem to follow that the disciples had in the meantime met, and taught, and baptised, and broken bread without them. Organisation of this kind was, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>important for the permanence of the life of the Church as such, but not essential to its being, or to the spiritual growth of individual members. (4) It will be remembered that the "elders" so appointed were the same as those who, in the Apostolic Church, were known as "bishops" or "overseers (<span class= "ital">episcopi</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>what we call distinctive episcopal functions being reserved for the Apostles, or for their personal representatives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.">1Timothy 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5</a>; see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Had prayed with fasting.</span>--See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2-3</a>. It is a legitimate inference, from this recurrence of the act, that Paul and Barnabas recognized it as an established rule or canon of the Church that these two acts should jointly serve as a preparation for the solemn work of appointing men to spiritual functions. Without prayer such an appointment was a mockery, and fasting served to intensify prayer.<p><span class= "bld">They commended them.</span>--The word is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-32.htm" title="And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.">Acts 20:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>. It implies the confiding trust of one who commits what is very precious to him to the keeping of another. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-2.htm" title="And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.">2Timothy 2:2</a> it is used of the <span class= "ital">depositum fidei, </span>the treasure of truth which Timothy was to commit to faithful men. Here it implies an absolute trust in God as ordering all things for His Church and those who love Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- Appointed for them</span> for <span class="accented">ordained them</span>, A.V.

The original meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is "to stretch out the hand," and the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is used in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-9.htm">Isaiah 58:9</a> for "the putting forth of the finger" of the A.V. But the common meaning of the verb is "to vote by stretching out the hand" and hence "to elect" by a show of hands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-19.htm">2 Corinthians 8:19</a>), or simply "to appoint," without any reference to voting. In the choice of an apostle the election was by lot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>), in the appointment of deacons the choice was by the people, how indicated we are not told (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>); the question here, on which commentators disagree, is whether the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> indicates voting by the people, selection by the apostles, or simple creation or appointment. As <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is predicated of Paul and Barnabas, it cannot possibly refer to voting by the people, who are included in the <span class="accented">able</span>, as those on whose behalf the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> was made. It seems simplest and most in accordance with the classical use of the word and its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), to take it in the sense of <span class="accented">creation</span> or <span class="accented">appointment</span> (see Steph., 'Thesaur.'). There is no reference to the laying on of hands. <span class="cmt_word">Elders</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>, note; Acts 20:17; and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5, 7</a>, where we see that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> was synony- mous with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>).

Hence in the Church ordinations are preceded by the Ember days. <span class="cmt_word">They commended them to the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-32.htm">Acts 20:32</a>). In ver. 26 the word used is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:19-28 See how restless the rage of the Jews was against the gospel of Christ. The people stoned Paul, in a popular tumult. So strong is the bent of the corrupt and carnal heart, that as it is with great difficulty that men are kept back from evil on one side, so it is with great ease they are persuaded to evil on the other side. If Paul would have been Mercury, he might have been worshipped; but if he will be a faithful minister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and thrown out of the city. Thus men who easily submit to strong delusions, hate to receive the truth in the love of it. All who are converted need to be confirmed in the faith; all who are planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work is to establish saints as well as to awaken sinners. The grace of God, and nothing less, effectually establishes the souls of the disciples. It is true, we must count upon much tribulation, but it is encouragement that we shall not be lost and perish in it. The Person to whose power and grace the converts and the newly-established churches are commended, clearly was the Lord Jesus, on whom they had believed. It was an act of worship. The praise of all the little good we do at any time, must be ascribed to God; for it is He who not only worketh in us both to will and to do, but also worketh with us to make what we do successful. All who love the Lord Jesus, will rejoice to hear that he has opened the door of faith wide, to those who were strangers to him and to his salvation. And let us, like the apostles, abide with those who know and love the Lord.</body></html>
