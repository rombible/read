There may have been such an altar in the <span class= "ital">atrium, </span>or one may have been improvised for the occasion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">whose temple was before the city</span> for <span class="accented">which was before their city</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">the multitudes</span> for the <span class="accented">people</span>, A.V., as in ver. 12. <span class="cmt_word">The priest of Jupiter</span>. The words, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., may be construed in two ways - either as in the A.V., or <span class="accented">the priest of</span> the temple <span class="accented">of Jupiter, etc.</span>, understanding, by a common ellipse, <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, or, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, after <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the Latin phrase," Ubi ad Dianae veneris;" "When you come to the temple of Diana," etc. But it is not a Greek phrase to speak of Jupiter being before the city, meaning the temple of Jupiter. Therefore the proper way of translating is to take the full phrase as being <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> article <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> belonging to <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> being, as in so many instances, without the article (see Matthew, 'Gr. Gr.,' 281). <span class="cmt_word">The gates</span>; viz. of the city. The temple was just outside the gates; the lame man, it is likely, sat inside near the gates through which men were passing in and out. Paul and Barnabas would address the -people in the square or open space inside the gates. Seeing a stir at the gates, and hearing that it was the priest of Jupiter coming with oxen and garlands to sacrifice to them, they immediately ran forward to prevent it. The ox was the proper sacrifice for Jupiter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:8-18 All things are possible to those that believe. When we have faith, that most precious gift of God, we shall be delivered from the spiritual helplessness in which we were born, and from the dominion of sinful habits since formed; we shall be made able to stand upright and walk cheerfully in the ways of the Lord. When Christ, the Son of God, appeared in the likeness of men, and did many miracles, men were so far from doing sacrifice to him, that they made him a sacrifice to their pride and malice; but Paul and Barnabas, upon their working one miracle, were treated as gods. The same power of the god of this world, which closes the carnal mind against truth, makes errors and mistakes find easy admission. We do not learn that they rent their clothes when the people spake of stoning them; but when they spake of worshipping them; they could not bear it, being more concerned for God's honour than their own. God's truth needs not the services of man's falsehood. The servants of God might easily obtain undue honours if they would wink at men's errors and vices; but they must dread and detest such respect more than any reproach. When the apostles preached to the Jews, who hated idolatry, they had only to preach the grace of God in Christ; but when they had to do with the Gentiles, they must set right their mistakes in natural religion. Compare their conduct and declaration with the false opinions of those who think the worship of a God, under any name, or in any manner, is equally acceptable to the Lord Almighty. The most powerful arguments, the most earnest and affectionate addresses, even with miracles, are scarcely enough to keep men from absurdities and abominations; much less can they, without special grace, turn the hearts of sinners to God and to holiness.</body></html>
