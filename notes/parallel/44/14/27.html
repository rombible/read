It would seem to have been a favourite metaphor of St. Paul's (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>), and comes in here, probably, as a fragment from his speech. From this point of view it is interesting to note the recurrence of the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-8.htm" title="I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.">Revelation 3:8</a>, both St. Paul and St. John, representing as they did different sections of the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>), agreeing in the thought that the door of the Father's house was now opened wider than it had ever been before, and that no man might shut it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> <span class="accented">- All things</span> for <span class="accented">all</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">how that</span> for <span class="accented">how</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a door</span> for <span class="accented">the door</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A door</span>. <span class="accented">The door</span> is preferable, because "the faith" limits the door to one kind of opening. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a> the case is a little different both in the A.V. and the R.V., though in the latter "the door of the Word" would be a truer rendering. Observe how the leading idea of the narrative is the conversion of the Gentiles. (See Introduction to the Acts.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:19-28 See how restless the rage of the Jews was against the gospel of Christ. The people stoned Paul, in a popular tumult. So strong is the bent of the corrupt and carnal heart, that as it is with great difficulty that men are kept back from evil on one side, so it is with great ease they are persuaded to evil on the other side. If Paul would have been Mercury, he might have been worshipped; but if he will be a faithful minister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and thrown out of the city. Thus men who easily submit to strong delusions, hate to receive the truth in the love of it. All who are converted need to be confirmed in the faith; all who are planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work is to establish saints as well as to awaken sinners. The grace of God, and nothing less, effectually establishes the souls of the disciples. It is true, we must count upon much tribulation, but it is encouragement that we shall not be lost and perish in it. The Person to whose power and grace the converts and the newly-established churches are commended, clearly was the Lord Jesus, on whom they had believed. It was an act of worship. The praise of all the little good we do at any time, must be ascribed to God; for it is He who not only worketh in us both to will and to do, but also worketh with us to make what we do successful. All who love the Lord Jesus, will rejoice to hear that he has opened the door of faith wide, to those who were strangers to him and to his salvation. And let us, like the apostles, abide with those who know and love the Lord.</body></html>
