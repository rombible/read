The tense implies a process of some continuance. The "wheat" which they now cast out may have been part of the cargo which had been reserved by way of provisions. As it was clear that they could no longer continue in the ship, this was no longer required, and the one essential point was to keep her floating till they reached the shore.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- Throwing out</span> for <span class="accented">and cast out</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They lightened the ship</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, only here in the New Testament; but it is the technical word for lightening a ship so as to keep her afloat. So in Polybius, 1:39, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>: and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>, "They cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (see ver. 18, note). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> is one of the technical expressions for taking cargo out of a ship, given by Julius Pollux (Smith), <span class="cmt_word">The wheat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). There is a difference of opinion as to what St. Luke here means by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Meyer and others think it was merely "the ship's provision," and that, considering the number of persons in the ship, and the little consumption during the last fortnight, the weight of what was left would be considerable. They add that the cargo had been already thrown overboard in ver. 18. Others, as Howson, following Smith and Penroso, Farrar, Lewin, and many older commentators, with more reason, understand "the wheat" to mean the ship's cargo from Alexandria to Rome; they think it had been impossible to get at it while the ship was drifting; and that, even had it been possible, it was the last thing they would have recourse to. But now, when it was impossible to save the ship, and the only chance of saving their lives was to run her on the beach, it was an absolute necessity to lighten the ship as much as possible. They therefore cast her freight of Alexandrian corn into the sea, and waited for daylight (see note to ver. 18). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:30-38 God, who appointed the end, that they should be saved, appointed the means, that they should be saved by the help of these shipmen. Duty is ours, events are God's; we do not trust God, but tempt him, when we say we put ourselves under his protection, if we do not use proper means, such as are within our power, for our safety. But how selfish are men in general, often even ready to seek their own safety by the destruction of others! Happy those who have such a one as Paul in their company, who not only had intercourse with Heaven, but was of an enlivening spirit to those about him. The sorrow of the world works death, while joy in God is life and peace in the greatest distresses and dangers. The comfort of God's promises can only be ours by believing dependence on him, to fulfil his word to us; and the salvation he reveals must be waited for in use of the means he appoints. If God has chosen us to salvation, he has also appointed that we shall obtain it by repentance, faith, prayer, and persevering obedience; it is fatal presumption to expect it in any other way. It is an encouragement to people to commit themselves to Christ as their Saviour, when those who invite them, clearly show that they do so themselves.</body></html>
