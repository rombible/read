At the west end of St. Paul's Bay lies the island of Salmonetta. From their place of anchorage the crew could not have seen that it was an island, and in trying to run the ship on the beach they grounded on a mud-bank between the small island and the coast. The waves swept round the island and met on the bank, and the position of the ship was accordingly one of extreme danger, the prow imbedded in the mud, the stern exposed to the billows.<p><span class= "bld">The hinder part was broken.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">was</span> <span class= "ital">being broken up, </span>the tense expressing continuous action.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="accented">But lighting upon</span> for <span class="accented">and falling taro</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">vessel</span> for <span class="accented">ship</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">fore-ship for forepart</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">struck</span> for <span class="accented">stuck fast</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">stern</span> for <span class="accented">hinder part</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">began to break up</span> for <span class="accented">was broken with</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Where two seas met</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, only here, and in Dion Chrysostomus. The explanation of this "place where two seas met" is as follows: - As the ship stood at anchor in the bay on the north-east side of the island, it would have the Koura Point (<span class="accented">Ras el-Kaura</span>) on its left, and on entering deeper into the bay westward, the little island of Salmonetta, or Selmoon, otherwise called Gzeier, would lie on its right, and would appear to be part of the island of Malta, from which it is separated by a narrow channel about a hundred yards in width. When, however, she was just coming upon the beach for which she was making, she would come opposite to this open channel, and the sea from the north would break upon her and meet the sea on the south side of the island, where the ship was. Here, then, <span class="cmt_word">they ran the vessel aground</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, or, according to the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, is only found here in the Bible; but it is the regular word for running a ship aground, or ashore, in classical writers. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> has exactly the same meaning. The simple verbs <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> are also both in use for running a ship to land. <span class="cmt_word">The foreship struck</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, here only in the Bible, but very common in classical Greek. Its meaning here is not very different from its frequent medical meaning of a disease "fixing <span class="accented">itself"</span> and "settling" in some particular part of the body. <span class="cmt_word">Remained unmovable</span>. "A ship impelled by the force of a gale into a creek with a bottom such as that laid down in Admiral Smyth's chart of St. Paul's Bay, would strike a bottom of mud graduating into tenacious clay, into which the forepart would fix itself and be held fast, whilst the stern was exposed to the force of the waves" (Smith, p. 144). Unmovable; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>, in the Bible; but common in Greek writers in the sense of "firm," "unmovable." <span class="cmt_word">Began to break up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, like <span class="accented">solvo</span> and <span class="accented">dissolvo</span> in Latin). The planks were loosened and disjoined. <span class="cmt_word">By the violence</span>. The R.T. omits the words <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and so has <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> alone, somewhat like <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 21. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:39-44 The ship that had weathered the storm in the open sea, where it had room, is dashed to pieces when it sticks fast. Thus, if the heart fixes in the world in affection, and cleaving to it, it is lost. Satan's temptations beat against it, and it is gone; but as long as it keeps above the world, though tossed with cares and tumults, there is hope for it. They had the shore in view, yet suffered shipwreck in the harbour; thus we are taught never to be secure. Though there is great difficulty in the way of the promised salvation, it shall, without fail, be brought to pass. It will come to pass that whatever the trials and dangers may be, in due time all believers will get safely to heaven. Lord Jesus, thou hast assured us that none of thine shall perish. Thou wilt bring them all safe to the heavenly shore. And what a pleasing landing will that be! Thou wilt present them to thy Father, and give thy Holy Spirit full possession of them for ever.</body></html>
