But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.">Jonah 1:5</a>, "every man unto his god," the Apostle had passed his hours of darkness in silent communing with God, and now came forward with the assurance that his prayers were heard. With the feeling natural to one whose counsel had been slighted, he reminds them that if they had followed it they would have been spared the harm and loss (the same words are used in the Greek as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-10.htm" title="And said to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.">Acts 27:10</a>) to which they were now exposed. "Sirs," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm" title="And saying, Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach to you that you should turn from these vanities to the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:">Acts 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-25.htm" title="Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this craft we have our wealth.">Acts 19:25</a>, answers to the Greek for "men."<p><span class= "bld">And to have gained this harm and loss.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to have been spared.</span> The English reads as if the words were ironical, but parallel passages from other Greek writers show that to "gain" a harm and loss meant to escape them--to get, as it were, a profit out of them by avoiding them. This, St. Paul says, they would have done had they listened to his advice. The Geneva version adds an explanatory note, "that is, ye should have saved the losse by avoyding the danger." Tyndale and Cranmer take the words as the English reader, for the most part, takes them now, "and have brought unto us this harm and loss."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> <span class="accented">- And when they had been long without food</span> for <span class="accented">but after long abstinence</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">then Paul</span> for <span class="accented">Paul</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">set sail</span> for <span class="accented">loosed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and gotten</span> for <span class="accented">to have gained</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">injury</span> for <span class="accented">harm</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Long without food</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is only found here in the Bible; but it was the common medical term for loss of the appetite, and such is the most natural rendering here. There is nothing about "long abstinence" in the text, nor does the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> admit of being translated "<span class="accented">when</span> they had been." It describes a <span class="accented">present</span> condition. The literal rendering is, <span class="accented">when there was a great</span> (or, <span class="accented">general</span>) <span class="accented">loss of appetite</span> among the crew. The terror, the discomfort, the sea-sickness, the constant pressure of danger and labor, the difficulty of cooking, the unpalatableness of the food, combined to take away relish of their food, and they were becoming weak for want of nourishment. <span class="cmt_word">Have gotten</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Schleusner, Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' explain this as equivalent to "have avoided," or "have escaped," and quote Josephus ('Ant. Jud,' it. 3:2), <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "To avoid staining their hands;" and ' Bell. Jud.,' it. 16:4 (towards the close of Agrippa's speech), <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>," You will gain (i.e. avoid) the disgrace of defeat," like the use in Latin of <span class="accented">lucrifacere.</span> But it is simpler on the whole to understand it in the sense of "getting" as the fruit of your own conduct. We should say in English, "What have yon gained by this? Nothing but loss and shame." Compare too the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). So Liddell and Scott give us one use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> gain a loss, 1.<span class="accented">e.</span> reap disadvantage, and quote from Euripides, 'Hecuba,' 1. 518 (516, Scholefield), <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fb6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to gain double weeping." <span class="cmt_word">Injury</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); see ver. 10, note. In the A.V. "to have gained" observe the same idiom as in ver. 10, "and there to winter." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:21-29 They did not hearken to the apostle when he warned them of their danger; yet if they acknowledge their folly, and repent of it, he will speak comfort and relief to them when in danger. Most people bring themselves into trouble, because they do not know when they are well off; they come to harm and loss by aiming to mend their condition, often against advice. Observe the solemn profession Paul made of relation to God. No storms or tempests can hinder God's favour to his people, for he is a Help always at hand. It is a comfort to the faithful servants of God when in difficulties, that as long as the Lord has any work for them to do, their lives shall be prolonged. If Paul had thrust himself needlessly into bad company, he might justly have been cast away with them; but God calling him into it, they are preserved with him. They are given thee; there is no greater satisfaction to a good man than to know he is a public blessing. He comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself was comforted. God is ever faithful, therefore let all who have an interest in his promises be ever cheerful. As, with God, saying and doing are not two things, believing and enjoying should not be so with us. Hope is an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast, entering into that within the veil. Let those who are in spiritual darkness hold fast by that, and think not of putting to sea again, but abide by Christ, and wait till the day break, and the shadows flee away.</body></html>
