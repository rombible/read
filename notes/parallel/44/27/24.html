The words that follow imply that his prayer had not been bounded by his own interests, but had included those who were sharing the danger with him. We are reminded, as by the parallelism of contrast, of the words in which Caesar bade the pilot of his ship not to fear, but to commit himself to the wind, seeing that he carried "Caesar and the fortune of Caesar" (Plutarch, <span class= "ital">de Fortun. Rom.</span> p. 518).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- Stand</span> for <span class="accented">be brought</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">granted</span> for <span class="accented">given</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Stand</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the proper word for standing before a judge; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: and in the subscription to the Second Epistle to Timothy it is said that it was written "when Paul was <span class="accented">brought before</span> Nero the second time" (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>God hath granted</span>, etc. Doubtless in answer to his prayers. Compare the opposite statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 16, 18, 20</a>, "Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered themselves;" and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-26.htm">Genesis 18:26, 32</a>. Paul's calm courage and kind words, added to the proof they had of his prescient wisdom, were well calculated to inspire the crew with a reverential trust in him, and to rekindle their extinguished hope. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:21-29 They did not hearken to the apostle when he warned them of their danger; yet if they acknowledge their folly, and repent of it, he will speak comfort and relief to them when in danger. Most people bring themselves into trouble, because they do not know when they are well off; they come to harm and loss by aiming to mend their condition, often against advice. Observe the solemn profession Paul made of relation to God. No storms or tempests can hinder God's favour to his people, for he is a Help always at hand. It is a comfort to the faithful servants of God when in difficulties, that as long as the Lord has any work for them to do, their lives shall be prolonged. If Paul had thrust himself needlessly into bad company, he might justly have been cast away with them; but God calling him into it, they are preserved with him. They are given thee; there is no greater satisfaction to a good man than to know he is a public blessing. He comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself was comforted. God is ever faithful, therefore let all who have an interest in his promises be ever cheerful. As, with God, saying and doing are not two things, believing and enjoying should not be so with us. Hope is an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast, entering into that within the veil. Let those who are in spiritual darkness hold fast by that, and think not of putting to sea again, but abide by Christ, and wait till the day break, and the shadows flee away.</body></html>
