With a gentle and favourable breeze from the south, the pilot and the owner thought that all was smooth sailing, and the ship left the Fair Havens and made across the bay, a distance of thirty-four miles, for Phaenice. They still, however, hugged the coast, as afraid to venture too far into the open sea. The Greek adverb <span class= "ital">asson, </span>which is rightly rendered "close" in the Authorised version, has been mistaken, in the Vulgate and some other versions, for the accusative case of <span class= "ital">Assos, </span>as though it were a proper name, and the words have been variously rendered "when they had left Assos," or "when they had made for Asses," or "when they had come in sight of Assos." The island Assos, however, lay far to the north (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-13.htm" title="And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.">Acts 20:13</a>), and there is no evidence of the existence of any town of that name in Crete. Of the English versions, Wiclif and the Rhemish follow the Vulgate, "when they had removed" (W.), or "parted" (Rh.), "from Assos"; Tyndale and Cranmer, following Luther, "they loosed unto Asson." The Geneva translation was the first to give the true meaning, and is following by the Authorised version. The tense of the Greek verb for "they sailed close," implies that they were in the act of doing this when the storm burst upon them, as in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- They weighed anchor and</span> for <span class="accented">loosing thence, they</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">along Crete, close in shore</span> for <span class="accented">close by Crete</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Blew softly</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, only here in the New Testament, and not found elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">Supposing that they had obtained their purpose</span>. A south wind would be quite favorable for sailing east or east by north, from Fair Havens to Phoenix.

And so they at once <span class="cmt_word">weighed anchor</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, without an objective case following, "having lifted up," understand <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as in Julius Pollux, quoted by Smith.

For the earlier part of their voyage they would be obliged to keep very near the shore, to enable them to weather Cape Matala, which lay a little to the south of west from Fair Havens. Some take <span class="greek">&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as the name of a town on the coast, but the grammar of the sentence makes this impossible. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:12-20 Those who launch forth on the ocean of this world, with a fair gale, know not what storms they may meet with; and therefore must not easily take it for granted that they have obtained their purpose. Let us never expect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, and have no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only too heavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it. The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for the saving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means the sailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope of saving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and to trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
