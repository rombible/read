The sailing season with the Jews was reckoned from the Feast of Pentecost to that of Tabernacles, which fell five days after the Fast. Roman reckoning gave a somewhat wider range,<span class= "ital"> sc., </span>from the sixth day of the Ides of March to the third of the Ides of November. The manner in which St. Luke names the Fast, and not the Feast of Tabernacles, makes it probable that the time to which we are now come was between September 24th and October 1st, when the Etesian winds, which are always of the nature of equinoctial gales, would naturally be most violent. Probably, also, the date may have been fixed on St. Luke's memory by St. Paul's observance of the Fast. He was not likely to leave so memorable a day unregarded, however little he might care to impose its observance upon others. To keep the Feast of Tabernacles on board the ship was, of course, impossible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - And for <span class="accented">now</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the voyage</span> for <span class="accented">when sailing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">gone by</span> for <span class="accented">past</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Much time</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is very frequently used by St. Luke, both in the Gospel and the Acts, for "much," "many," or "long," but the exact quantity of time, or words, or people, etc., indicated is of course relative to what might reasonably be expected in each case. Judas of Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>) drew "much" people after him; the Jews at Damascus conspired to kill Saul after "many" days were fulfilled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23</a>); Paul and Barnabas abode "long time" at Iconium (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-3.htm">Acts 14:3</a>); Paul talked a "long" while at Tress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>); and they sailed slowly off the coast of Asia "many" days (ver. 7); the length, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "sufficiency" (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) must depend in each case upon the standard by which it is measured. Here "much time," measured by the common experience of sailing-vessels waiting for a favorable wind, may mean one or two weeks. It is more natural to apply the phrase to the time of their detention at Fair Havens, than, as Meyer and others do, to the time that elapsed since they sailed from Caesarea. <span class="cmt_word">The voyage was now dangerous</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, a late form for the older <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). <span class="accented">Dangerous</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, only here in the New Testament, and in Wisd. 9:14; also occasionally in classical authors, but very frequently in medical writers. <span class="cmt_word">The Fast</span>. The great Jewish fast on the Day of Atonement, in the month Tisri, which fell this year on September 24 (Lewin and Farrar), probably while they were at Fair Havens. The Jews considered navigation unsafe between the Feast of Tabernacles (five days after the Day of Atonement) and the Feast of Pentecost (Lewin, vol. it. p. 192, note). It became, therefore, a very serious question what they were to do. Fair Havens was an inconvenient anchorage for the winter, and not near any large town. On the other hand, if they passed beyond the shelter of Cape Matala, which lay a few miles to the east, and where the coast of Crete suddenly trends due north, they would be exposed to the violence of the Eterian westerly wind. They called St. Paul into their counsels. <span class="cmt_word">Admonished them</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, only here and ver. 22. In classical Greek used especially of advice given by a speaker in a public speech. In medical writers it expresses the advice given by a physician to his patient. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 It was determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined by the counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for God had work for him to do there. The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.</body></html>
