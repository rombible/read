While the ship was anchored the two large paddle-like rudders with which ancient ships were furnished, were lifted up out of the water and lashed with ropes to the ship's side.

This verse, so obscure before, has been made intelligible by the masterly labors of Smith, of Jordan Hill. We will first explain the separate words. <span class="cmt_word">Casting off</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in ver. 20; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-16.htm">2 Corinthians 3:16</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a>; and in all those passages is rendered "<span class="accented">taken</span> away." So also in the LXX., where it is of frequent use, it means "<span class="accented">take</span> away," "<span class="accented">put</span> away," "<span class="accented">remove</span>," and the like. In classical Greek it means to "<span class="accented">take</span> away," "take off," "strip off." Here, then, applied to the anchors which were firmly embedded in the very strong clay at the bottom of the sea off Koura Point, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> means "putting away" or "casting off" the anchors by cutting the cables which fastened them to the ship, and, as it follows, <span class="cmt_word">leaving them in the sea</span>, or, more literally, <span class="accented">giving them up, dismissing them into the sea</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-38.htm">Acts 5:38</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Loosing the bands of the rudders</span>. "The ships of the Greeks and Romans, like those of the early Northmen were not steered by a single rudder, but by two paddle-rudders" (Howson, p. 310. See too an illustration from an ancient painting found at Herculaneum, in which the two paddle-rudders are very distinctly seen, at p. 346; and another illustration in Lewin, vol. it. p. 204, showing the two rudders and the foresail). These paddle-rudders had been hoisted up and lashed, lest they should foul the anchors at the stern. But now, when the free use of them was absolutely necessary to steer the ship toward the beach, they unloosed the lashings, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span> "the bands of the rudders," and at the same time they hoisted up the foresail. <span class="cmt_word">The foresail</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, a word found only here in this sense, but used in Vitruvius for a "pulley," and so explained in Ducange. But <span class="accented">artimon</span> was till recently used in Venice and Genoa as the name of the large sail of a vessel. In the Middle Ages <span class="accented">artimonium</span> was the "foremast," <span class="accented">mat de prone</span>; but it was also used of the foresail," Velum naris breve, quod quia melius levari potest, in summo periculo extenditur" (Ducange). They hoisted the foresail both to give them sufficient way to run on to the beach, and to give precision to their steering. (For a further account of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, or foresail, see Smith, of Jordan Hill.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:39-44 The ship that had weathered the storm in the open sea, where it had room, is dashed to pieces when it sticks fast. Thus, if the heart fixes in the world in affection, and cleaving to it, it is lost. Satan's temptations beat against it, and it is gone; but as long as it keeps above the world, though tossed with cares and tumults, there is hope for it. They had the shore in view, yet suffered shipwreck in the harbour; thus we are taught never to be secure. Though there is great difficulty in the way of the promised salvation, it shall, without fail, be brought to pass. It will come to pass that whatever the trials and dangers may be, in due time all believers will get safely to heaven. Lord Jesus, thou hast assured us that none of thine shall perish. Thou wilt bring them all safe to the heavenly shore. And what a pleasing landing will that be! Thou wilt present them to thy Father, and give thy Holy Spirit full possession of them for ever.</body></html>
