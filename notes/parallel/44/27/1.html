It is probable, however, that they also had appealed to the emperor, as there would otherwise be no object in sending them to Rome.<p><span class= "bld">A centurion of Augustus' band.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of the Sebaste.</span> On the band or cohort as a subdivision of the Roman legion, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm" title="There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,">Acts 10:1</a>. Three different explanations have been given of the term translated "Augustus." (1) The cohort may have consisted of soldiers levied in Sebaste (= Augusta) or Samaria. Josephus mentions a squadron of Sebastene cavalry (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 6, ? 1; xix. 9, ? 2), and there may have been a corresponding band of foot-soldiers. (2) Nero about this time had formed a kind of body-guard, consisting of some 3, 000 young men of the equestrian order, who accompanied him to games and spectacles, and whose chief business it was to applaud him in his speeches and recitations. To these he gave the name of <span class= "ital">Augustani</span> (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xiv. 15; Sueton. <span class= "ital">Nero, </span>c. 25), a term of which Sebastene would be the natural Greek equivalent. (3) A certain Julius Priscus appears in Tacit. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 92 as appointed by Vitellius to be one of the prefects of the Praetorian cohorts, which, as specially under the emperor's personal command, might naturally be called by his name; and he has been conjecturally identified with the centurion here named. Of these, (2) seems the most probable, but it is not absolutely incompatible with (3). On this assumption, as it is not said that the cohort itself was at Caesarea, it is possible that he may have accompanied Festus as an escort to his province, and was now returning to Rome.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - For, for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan band</span> for unto <span class="accented">one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus</span> <span class="accented">band</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">That we should sail</span>. Observe the "we," denoting that Luke was of the party. Connecting it with the "we" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-17.htm">Acts 21:17</a>, the inference is obvious that Luke was with Paul through the whole of these two eventful years, and that it is to this presence that we owe the detailed circumstantial narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21.htm">Acts 21</a>. - 28, as well as, perhaps, the composition of St. Luke's Gospel, for which the two years at Caesarea afforded an admirable opportunity. <span class="cmt_word">The Augustan band</span>; or, <span class="accented">cohort</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a> (where see note). This <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">cohors Augusta</span>, was probably one of the five cohorts stationed at Caesarea, consisting of auxiliary troops (though Alford does not think so). Its name "Augustan" was given, after the analogy of the Augustan legion, just as there was an "Italian band" as well as two or three "Italian legions." It has been conjectured (Kuinoel, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.), indeed, that the name may rather be taken flora Sebaste, Samaria, as consisting of Samaritans, seeing that Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 2. 12:5) actually mentions a troop of cavalry (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) called the troop of Sebaste. But the Greek name is <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, which latter designation is not supported by any similar example (Meyer). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 It was determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined by the counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for God had work for him to do there. The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.</body></html>
