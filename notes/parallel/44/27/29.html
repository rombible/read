So Caesar describes his ships as being secured with four anchors each (<span class= "ital">Bell. Civ.</span> i. 25). In ancient navigation, as in modern, the anchors were commonly cast from the bow. In the battles of the Nile and of Copenhagen, however, Nelson had his ships anchored at the stern, and the fact derives a peculiar interest from the statement that he had been reading Acts 27 on the morning of the engagement. The result of this operation was that the ship was no longer in motion, and would be found, when the morning came, with her head to the shore. The tension of hope and fear, the suspense which made men almost cry--<p>"And if our fate be death, give light, and let us die,"<p>is vividly brought before us in St. Luke's few words, "they were praying for the day."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">lest haply</span> for <span class="accented">lest</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">be cast ashore on rocky ground</span> for <span class="accented">have fallen upon rocks</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">let go</span> for <span class="accented">east</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">out of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Cast ashore</span> (see ver. 17, note). <span class="cmt_word">Rocky ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-5.htm">Luke 3:5</a>.

The British navy so anchored at the battles of the Nile, Algiers, and Copenhagen, and it is a earn-men practice of the Levantine caiques at the present day; and an ancient picture of a ship (at Herculaneum) distinctly represents "hawse-holes aft to fit them for anchoring by the stern." They did so in the present case, to obviate the danger of the ship swinging round and getting into breakers, and also that she might be in the best position for running on to the beach as soon as daylight came. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:21-29 They did not hearken to the apostle when he warned them of their danger; yet if they acknowledge their folly, and repent of it, he will speak comfort and relief to them when in danger. Most people bring themselves into trouble, because they do not know when they are well off; they come to harm and loss by aiming to mend their condition, often against advice. Observe the solemn profession Paul made of relation to God. No storms or tempests can hinder God's favour to his people, for he is a Help always at hand. It is a comfort to the faithful servants of God when in difficulties, that as long as the Lord has any work for them to do, their lives shall be prolonged. If Paul had thrust himself needlessly into bad company, he might justly have been cast away with them; but God calling him into it, they are preserved with him. They are given thee; there is no greater satisfaction to a good man than to know he is a public blessing. He comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself was comforted. God is ever faithful, therefore let all who have an interest in his promises be ever cheerful. As, with God, saying and doing are not two things, believing and enjoying should not be so with us. Hope is an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast, entering into that within the veil. Let those who are in spiritual darkness hold fast by that, and think not of putting to sea again, but abide by Christ, and wait till the day break, and the shadows flee away.</body></html>
