(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-31.htm" title="And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent to him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.">Acts 19:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-37.htm" title="For you have brought here these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.">Acts 19:37</a>.) The "friends" of St. Paul at Sidon were probably Christian disciples who had seen him when he passed through Ph?nicia, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm" title="And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brothers.">Acts 15:3</a>, or in other journeys.<p><span class= "bld">To refresh himself</span>.--Literally, <span class= "ital">to avail himself of their care.</span> The Greek word suggests the thought of a provision of personal comforts, clothing and the like, for the voyage.

Paul was glad to have an opportunity of visiting them while the ship was stopping there to unload, and set down and take up passengers; and Julius, perhaps by the orders of Festus and Agrippa, and also from the influence Paul's character and conduct had on him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>), courteously gave him leave to land, probably accompanied by a soldier. <span class="cmt_word">And refresh himself</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to meet with care.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs only here in the New Testament, but is found in 1 Macc. 16:14 2Macc. 11:23, and is frequent in Xenophon and other classical writers, by whom it is used with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, as here.

It is in very common use among medical writers for the care and attention required by the sick. It is very probable that St. Paul was suffering from his long confinement at Caesarea, and that the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here mentioned has reference to his invalid state. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 It was determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined by the counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for God had work for him to do there. The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.</body></html>
