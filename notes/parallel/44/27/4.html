As it was, the wind probably being from the north-west, they made for the channel between Cyprus and Cilicia, and, sailing close under the lee of the long, projecting east coast of the island from Salamis to the promontory of Dinaretium (<span class= "ital">Capo Andrea</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>were thus sheltered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Putting to sea</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, see ver. 3, note) for <span class="accented">when we had launched</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">under the lee of</span> for <span class="accented">under</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We sailed under the lee of</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, only here and ver. 7. A nautical term, very rarely met with. <span class="cmt_word">The winds were contrary</span>. The wind apparently was westerly, the prevalent wind at that season of the year. Smith ('Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul') quotes Admiral De Saumarez as writing from near Cyprus, "The westerly winds invariably prevail at this season;" and M. De Page, a French navigator, as saying, "The winds from the west which prevail in these places (Cyprus) forced us to run to the north." This is exactly what the ship in which Paul sailed did. Instead of going in a westerly direction, and leaving Cyprus on her right, she turned due north, having Cyprus on her left. It was now late in August (Farrar, p. 363). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 It was determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined by the counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for God had work for him to do there. The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.</body></html>
