Grammatically the pronoun seems to refer to Crete, and if referred to it, the sentence admits of three possible constructions: (1) the wind <span class= "ital">drove us against</span> Crete; or (2), <span class= "ital">blew against</span> Crete; or (3), <span class= "ital">drove down on us from</span> Crete. Of these, (1) and (2) are at variance with the facts of the case, as the gale blew the ship away from Crete to the south, while (3), which is as tenable grammatically, exactly agrees with them. Some translators (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Luther) have, however, referred the pronoun to the noun "purpose,"--"the wind blew against their purpose;" but this gives a less satisfactory sense. Of the English versions Wiclif gives "was against it," leaving the sense ambiguous. Tyndale and Cranmer follow Luther, "there arose against their purpose." The Geneva adopts the first of the above readings, "there arose against Candie," and is followed by the Rhemish, "drove against it."<p><span class= "bld">A tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</span>--The Greek adjective <span class= "ital">typhonic</span> is perpetuated in the modern "typhoon," as applied to whirlwinds like that now described. The "vortex" of such a wind is indeed its distinguishing feature. The name <span class= "ital">Euroclydon, </span>which is fairly represented by such a word as "wide-wave," or "broad-billow," is not found elsewhere, and, if the reading be genuine, must be looked on as a term which St. Luke reported as actually used by the sailors on board. Some of the best MSS., however, give the form <span class= "ital">Euro-aquilo, </span>which, though a somewhat hybrid word unknown to Greek and Latin writers, fits in, as meaning north-east, or, more strictly, east by north, with all the phenomena described. The earlier English--Wiclif, Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Geneva--all give "north-east," while the Rhemish reproduces the term <span class= "ital">Euro-aquilo, </span>without attempting to translate. A sudden change from south to north, with a great increase of violence, is a common phenomenon in the autumnal storms of the Mediterranean, and in this instance the blast would seem to have rushed down on the ship from the hills of Crete.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- After no long time</span> for <span class="accented">not long after</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">beat down from</span> for <span class="accented">arose against</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which is called Euraquilo</span> for <span class="accented">called Euroclydon</span>, A.V. and T.B. <span class="cmt_word">There beat down from it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). The meaning of this somewhat difficult phrase clearly is that given by Alford and Howson, and, on second thoughts, by Smith, viz. that a violent squall from the north-east beat down the heights and through the valleys of the island, becoming more violent when they had passed Cape Matala, and compelled them to alter their course, and run south-west before the wind towards the island of Clauda; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in a neuter sense, "struck," or "beat," or "fell," as in Homer (see Liddell and Scott). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. Farrar thinks it "certain" that the right rendering is "against her," viz. the ship, because <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> could not be used with nothing to follow it," 1.e. he thinks you must say <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> something. But as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the word used for the ship, not <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, it seems very difficult to suppose that Luke could say <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, and not <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. It is better, therefore, to refer <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, and either to understand it "down it," like <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "down the heights of Olympus;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "down the <span class="accented">rock</span>," etc., or simply "against <span class="accented">it</span>," as in the A.V., which obviates Dr. Farrar's objection. If taken in the sense of "down" there is the same idea of a squall "rushing down" from the hills into the lake, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-23.htm">Luke 8:23</a>; and again in ver. 33 of the same chapter St. Luke tells us how the swine rushed <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "down the steep," into the lake. <span class="cmt_word">A tempestuous wind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, only here, and not found in Greek writers; but the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is common for a "furious storm" or "whirlwind." <span class="cmt_word">Euraquilo</span>. Compounded - after the analogy <span class="accented">of Euronotus</span>, the south-east wind - of <span class="accented">Eurus</span>, the east wind, and <span class="accented">Aquilo</span>, the north wind, both Latin words (like <span class="accented">Corns</span>, in ver. 12), though Eurus is also Greek. This reading of the R.T. is supported by the Vulgate, and by "Lachmann, Bornemann, Ewald, J. Smith, Hackett, Bentley, Olshausen, after Erasmus, Grotius, Mill, Bengel, and others" (Meyer), and by Wordsworth, Alford, Lid-dell and Scott, Factor. On the other hand, Meyer, Tischendorf, Dean Howson, and others support the reading of the T.R. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and Lewis is doubtful. The derivation of <span class="accented">Euroelydon</span> would be from <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, a wave. Whatever its name was, it must have been a north-easter. Psalm evil. 25 naturally arises to one's remembrance, with its fine description of a storm at sea. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:12-20 Those who launch forth on the ocean of this world, with a fair gale, know not what storms they may meet with; and therefore must not easily take it for granted that they have obtained their purpose. Let us never expect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, and have no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only too heavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it. The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for the saving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means the sailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope of saving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and to trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
