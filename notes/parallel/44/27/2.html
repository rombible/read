It lay on the Roman road from Assos and Troas to Pergamus, Ephesus, and Miletus. It was a port of considerable importance, and the Gulf of <span class= "ital">Adramyti</span> still retains its name. There would seem to have been but little direct intercourse by sea between Caesarea and Rome, and the voyage had therefore to be made, now in one ship, now in another. Changes of this kind occurred, it will be remembered, in St. Paul's journey from Philippi to Caesarea. Possibly it was at first intended that the prisoners should go to Adramyttium, cross to Greece, and then proceed by land. "Asia" is, of course, the proconsular province so called. Looking to the fact that the "fast," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Day of Atonement (falling this year on Sept. 24th), was over when St. Paul reached Crete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>), the date of embarkation may be fixed, with much probability, in the middle, or towards the end, of the previous August.<p><span class= "bld">One Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica.</span>--It is reasonable to infer that Aristarchus, who had come with St. Paul to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>), had remained in Palestine during the two years of the Apostle's imprisonment, and was now intending to return to his native city. The subsequent alteration of plan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-6.htm" title="And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.">Acts 27:6</a>), however, led to his accompanying him to Rome, and we find him there with St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>, sharing his imprisonment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- Embarking in</span> for <span class="accented">entering into</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which was about to sail unto the places on the coasts of Asia, we put to sea</span> for we <span class="accented">launched, meaning to sail by the coast of Asia</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Aristarchus</span> for <span class="accented">one Aristarchus</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Adramyttium</span> (now <span class="accented">Adra-myti</span>, where ships are still built), on the north-western coast of Asia Minor, south of Troas, on the gulf opposite which lies the island of Lesbos, was a place of considerable trade, situated on the great Roman road which connected the Hellespont with Ephesus and Miletus. <span class="cmt_word">Which was about to sail</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the T.R.), describing the ship as a coasting-vessel, trading between Adramyttium and other ports on the coast of Asia. She was now on her homeward voyage. <span class="cmt_word">Aristarchus</span>. He is first mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>, as a Macedonian, and one of Paul's companions at Ephesus, pro-badly, therefore, the fruit of his first visit to Thessalonica. We find him again with St, Paul on his last journey from Corinth to Asia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>), and we gather from the present notice of him that he kept with him till he arrived at Jerusalem, and followed him to Caesarea. It would appear at first sight, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, that he not only stayed with St. Paul during his two years' imprisonment at Rome, but was his "fellow-prisoner," if at least the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> to be taken literally. This, however, is very doubtful, because in the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 16:7) St. Paul calls Andronicus and Junius his "fellow-prisoners," though he was not then in prison himself; and also because, in the Epistle to Philemon (Philemon 1:23, 24), he gives this epithet to Epaphras, with the addition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> ("my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus"), and does not give it to Aristarchus, who is named in the same sentence as his <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, and Bishop Ellicott, on ibid.).

The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.</body></html>
