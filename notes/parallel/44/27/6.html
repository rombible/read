This may have been owing to the prevalence of the westerly winds already noticed. The Alexandrian traders, however, as a rule, avoided taking the course along the coast of Africa, through fear of the quicksands of the great Syrtis, and took that between Crete and the Peloponnesus. The presence of this merchantship led to a change of plan. It seemed an easier and more expeditious route to go straight to Rome, instead of landing at Mysia, and then taking another ship to Macedonia in order to journey by land to the coast of the Adriatic. A local inscription describes Myra as a "horrea," or store-house of corn (Lewin's <span class= "ital">St. Paul, </span>ii. p. 187), and the Alexandrian ship may therefore have gone thither to discharge part of its cargo. It has been assumed, but on insufficient grounds, that Aristarchus here parted from St. Paul, and went on in the Adramyttium ship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- For</span>, for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>He put us therein</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, only here in the New Testament, and once in the LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-11.htm">Proverbs 4:11</a>). It is a nautical term for embarking men on board ship (Thucydides, Xenophon, Lucian, etc.), and is also used by medical writers for "placing patients in a bath." The corn-vessel (<span class="accented">naris frumentaria</span>) <span class="accented">from</span> Alexandria to Italy may very probably have been driven out of its direct course by the same contrary winds which forced St. Paul to sail under Cyprus (see Howson, vol. it. p. 325, note 5), or commercial objects may have brought it to Lycia, to carry Asiatic merchandize to Rome, in addition to its cargo of Egyptian wheat - possibly "timber from the woody mountains of Lycia" (Lewin, vol. it. p. 188, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 It was determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined by the counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for God had work for him to do there. The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.</body></html>
