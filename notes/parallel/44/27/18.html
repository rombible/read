They effected, in this way, the relief of the ship from the imminent danger of sinking. The act shows that, in spite of the undergirding, leakage was still going on.

It is the passive voice, and this is best expressed by the A.V. "tossed." <span class="cmt_word">They began to throw</span>, etc. The phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> is one of the technical phrases for taking a cargo out of a ship, given by Julius Pollux; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (Alford, from Smith).

It is inferred from this, and the subsequent statement (ver. 19) as to throwing overboard the tackling of the ship, that, in spite of the undergirding, the ship was leaking, and therefore heavy with water, and in danger of going down (romp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>). The freight here mentioned may have been heavy packages of merchandise other than the main cargo of wheat (see ver. 6, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:12-20 Those who launch forth on the ocean of this world, with a fair gale, know not what storms they may meet with; and therefore must not easily take it for granted that they have obtained their purpose. Let us never expect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, and have no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only too heavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it. The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for the saving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means the sailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope of saving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and to trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
