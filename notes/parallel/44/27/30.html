It was easy for the sailors to urge that the ship needed anchors fore as well as aft, and, while pretending to be occupied about this, to lower the boat which they had before hoisted on deck (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-16.htm" title="And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:">Acts 27:16</a>), and so effect their escape. The boat, it might appear, was necessary to their alleged purpose, as their ostensible aim was not merely to cast anchors from the bow, but to carry them out (as the word which St. Luke uses implies) to the full tether of the cable's length.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="accented">- Sailors</span> for <span class="accented">shipmen</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">seeking</span> for <span class="accented">about</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and had lowered</span> for <span class="accented">when they had let down</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">lay out</span> for <span class="accented">have east</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">out of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Had lowered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, see ver. 17, note). The sailors thought the only chance of safety was to get into the boat and run ashore on the beach. They pretended, therefore, that they wished to let down more anchors from the bow; and let down the boat, as if with that intention, being prepared to jump in and make for the shore, leaving the ship to be wrecked, with all on board her. What a contrast to the conduct of our English crews, who are always the last to quit a sinking vessel! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:30-38 God, who appointed the end, that they should be saved, appointed the means, that they should be saved by the help of these shipmen. Duty is ours, events are God's; we do not trust God, but tempt him, when we say we put ourselves under his protection, if we do not use proper means, such as are within our power, for our safety. But how selfish are men in general, often even ready to seek their own safety by the destruction of others! Happy those who have such a one as Paul in their company, who not only had intercourse with Heaven, but was of an enlivening spirit to those about him. The sorrow of the world works death, while joy in God is life and peace in the greatest distresses and dangers. The comfort of God's promises can only be ours by believing dependence on him, to fulfil his word to us; and the salvation he reveals must be waited for in use of the means he appoints. If God has chosen us to salvation, he has also appointed that we shall obtain it by repentance, faith, prayer, and persevering obedience; it is fatal presumption to expect it in any other way. It is an encouragement to people to commit themselves to Christ as their Saviour, when those who invite them, clearly show that they do so themselves.</body></html>
