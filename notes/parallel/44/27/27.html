So Josephus (<span class= "ital">Life, </span>c. 3), narrating his shipwreck, just two years after St. Paul's, on his voyage from Judaea to Puteoli, states that he was picked up by another ship sailing from Cyrene to the same port, "in the middle of Adria."

The country which they were nearing could hardly be any other than the head-land known as the Point of Koura, at the east extremity of St. Paul's, Bay, in Malta.

As regards the use of term <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the Adriatic, it is used in two ways: sometimes strictly of the Gulf of Venice, the Adriatic; sometimes, chiefly in latter writers, in a much wider sense, of the whole sea between Greece and Italy, including Sicily. This last is its use here. So, too, Josephus says that he was wrecked <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, in the midst of the Adriatic, on his voyage from Caesarea to Puteoli, and was picked up by a ship from Cyrene. This implies that he used the word "<span class="accented">Adria"</span> in the same sense as St. Luke does (see further the appendix 5. and 6. in Smith's 'Voyage,' etc.; Conybeare and Howson, p. 343, note, and p. 350; Lewin, vol. 2. p. 198, note; Farrar, vol. 2. p. 377, note; Renan, ' St. Paul,' p. 552). <span class="cmt_word">Surmised that they were drawing near</span>. Probably from hearing the waves breaking upon the Point of Koura, east of St. Paul's Bay. <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> is only found in the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-25.htm">Acts 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-18.htm">Acts 25:18</a>; and here); but it is used three or four times in the LXX. (Daniel, Job, Judith, Sirach), and is common in classical Greek in the sense of to "suspect, conjecture," "guess at" anything (<span class="accented">see</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>). <span class="accented">Were drawing near</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">that some country</span> (or, <span class="accented">land</span>) was drawing near to them. In like manner, the land is said <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, to recede, as the vessel gets out to sea. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:21-29 They did not hearken to the apostle when he warned them of their danger; yet if they acknowledge their folly, and repent of it, he will speak comfort and relief to them when in danger. Most people bring themselves into trouble, because they do not know when they are well off; they come to harm and loss by aiming to mend their condition, often against advice. Observe the solemn profession Paul made of relation to God. No storms or tempests can hinder God's favour to his people, for he is a Help always at hand. It is a comfort to the faithful servants of God when in difficulties, that as long as the Lord has any work for them to do, their lives shall be prolonged. If Paul had thrust himself needlessly into bad company, he might justly have been cast away with them; but God calling him into it, they are preserved with him. They are given thee; there is no greater satisfaction to a good man than to know he is a public blessing. He comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself was comforted. God is ever faithful, therefore let all who have an interest in his promises be ever cheerful. As, with God, saying and doing are not two things, believing and enjoying should not be so with us. Hope is an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast, entering into that within the veil. Let those who are in spiritual darkness hold fast by that, and think not of putting to sea again, but abide by Christ, and wait till the day break, and the shadows flee away.</body></html>
