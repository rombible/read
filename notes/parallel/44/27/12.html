The harbour so described has been identified with the modern <span class= "ital">Lutro, </span>on the east of the promontory of <span class= "ital">Kavo Muros, </span>which looks eastward, and so corresponds to the interpretation just given of the words that describe it. The harbour is named by Ptolemy (iii. 17) as Phoenikous, and a city named Phoenix lay a few miles inland. It is still used as a harbour by Greek pirates, and was marked as such in the French admiralty charts of 1738; but, owing to the silting up of the sand, has become unsuitable for larger vessels. An inscription of the time of Nerva, of the nature of a votive tablet to Jupiter and Serapis, found near the spot, records the fact that it was erected by Epictetus, the <span class= "ital">tabularius, </span>or agent, of the fleet to which the ship belonged, with the assistance of Dionysius of Alexandria, the pilot (the same word as that which St. Luke uses) of a ship which had as its sign (the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-4.htm" title="And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffers not to live.">Acts 28:4</a>) the Isopharia. It is a natural inference from this that the Alexandrian ship (we note the Egyptian element in the dedication to Serapis, and possibly in the connection of the sign with the Pharos, or lighthouse of Alexandria) had anchored, and possibly wintered, at Ph?nice, and that the tablet was a thank-offering for its preservation.

It is generally, if not always, used of coming from the higher to the lower place, and from the sea to the land (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-19.htm">Acts 18:19, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-15.htm">Acts 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-7.htm">Acts 21:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-13.htm">Acts 28:13</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Phoenix</span>.

It is identified with almost certainty with the modern <span class="accented">Lutro</span> or <span class="accented">Loutro</span>, which is both "an admirable harbor," situated exactly where Phoenice ought to be, and further by its proximity to a village called <span class="accented">Aradhene</span>, and another called <span class="accented">Anopolis</span>, shown to be the same as. Phoenix, or Phenice, which is described m ancient writers (Hierocles and Stephanus of Byzantium) as identical with or close to <span class="accented">Aradhena</span> and <span class="accented">Anopolls</span> (the upper city). <span class="cmt_word">Winter</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, so too <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-11.htm">Acts 28:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in this verse. It is found also in classical writers. <span class="cmt_word">Looking north-east and south-east.</span> The margin of the R.V. has "Greek, <span class="accented">down the southwest wind, and down the north-west."</span> This phrase has caused considerable perplexity to commentators. To say, as a recommendation of a harbor for winter quarters, that it lies or looks toward the south-west and north-west, and consequently is exposed to the most furious winter storms, is obviously impossible. If Phoenix was open to the south-west and the north-west, it would not be as commodius a place to winter in as Fair Havens was which was sheltered by Cape Matala. Two methods, therefore, have been adopted of explaining the phrase so as to make it give a reasonable sense. One, that adopted by Dean Howson and Bishop Wordsworth, viz. that it looks southwest and north-west, from the point of view of the sailor, or any one approaching it from the sea, the object upon which it looks being the land which locks it in and shelters it. The other is that supported by Alford, and adopted by the R.V., and rests upon the observation that <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> are not points or' the compass, but the names of the south-west and north-west winds, and that to look down (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>) a wind is the same as looking down a stream. If the harbour looks down the south-west wind it looks toward the north-east, and if it looks down the north-west wind it looks toward the southeast. Its open side would be from northeast to south-east, it would be entirely sheltered on the south-west and north-west side. This is the explanation adopted also by Dean Plumptre. <span class="accented">The south-west wind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;</span>, only here in the New Testament, but frequent in classical Greek and in the LXX. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>. [82, Septuagint] 26). As a point of the compass, it is the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14</a>, etc.), <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-10.htm">Numbers 2:10</a>, etc.), of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>). <span class="accented">The north-west wind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (the Latin <span class="accented">Caurus</span> or <span class="accented">Corus</span>), only here in the New Testament, and not found in Greek writers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:12-20 Those who launch forth on the ocean of this world, with a fair gale, know not what storms they may meet with; and therefore must not easily take it for granted that they have obtained their purpose. Let us never expect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, and have no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only too heavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it. The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for the saving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means the sailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope of saving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and to trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
