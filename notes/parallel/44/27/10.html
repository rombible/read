St. Paul had had, it will be remembered, the experience of three shipwrecks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2Corinthians 11:25</a>), and the Epistle to Titus, though probably written later, shows an acquaintance with Crete which suggests that he may have had some knowledge even of the very harbour in which they had found refuge. His advice accordingly was to remain where they were, in comparative safety, in spite of the drawbacks referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-12.htm" title="And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lies toward the south west and north west.">Acts 27:12</a>. The word for "hurt," which properly means "outrage," is used here in the sense of a violent calamity.<p><span class= "bld">Not only of the lading.</span>--The cargo probably consisted chiefly of corn coming from Alexandria to Rome. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-18.htm" title="And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;">Acts 27:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-38.htm" title="And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.">Acts 27:38</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But also of our lives.</span>--No lives were actually lost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-44.htm" title="And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship.

When his counsel was rejected he gave himself to prayer, and to that prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-24.htm" title="Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, see, God has given you all them that sail with you.">Acts 27:24</a>) he attributes the preservation of his companions not less than his own.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- The</span>, for <span class="accented">this</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">injury</span> for <span class="accented">hurt</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">loss</span> for <span class="accented">damage</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the ship</span> for <span class="accented">ship</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Sirs, I perceive</span>; etc. St. Paul's opinion and reasons are evidently not fully given; only the result, that he strongly advised against the course to which they were inclined, and foretold disaster as likely to ensue from it. <span class="accented">I perceive</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>), as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-19.htm">John 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22</a>. In all these places something actually seen or heard leads to the inference or conclusion stated. So here the angry state of the weather and of the sea - perhaps they had walked as far as Cape Matala, and seen the rough waves - convinced him of the rashness of the enterprise contemplated. <span class="cmt_word">Injury</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, and at ver. 21); literally, <span class="accented">violence, rough usage -</span> properly of persons to persons (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>), but metaphorically here transferred to inanimate objects.

Meyer's explanation of <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, as meaning "presumption" or "temerity" on the part of the navigators, is quite inadmissible, especially in view of ver. 21. <span class="cmt_word">Also of our lives</span>. Observe the thorough honesty of the historian who thus records the words of the apostle, though they were not justified by the event (vers. 22, 24). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 It was determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined by the counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for God had work for him to do there. The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.</body></html>
