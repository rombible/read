The process described, technically known as "frapping," consisted in carrying a strong cable several times round the ship from stem to stern, so as to keep the planks from starting, and guard against the consequent leakage. The practice has always been a common one. Thucydides (i. 29) mentions the Corcyreans as having recourse to it. The Russian ships taken in the Tagus in 1808 were kept together in this manner in consequence of their age and unsound condition (Arnold, on <span class= "ital">Thuc.</span> i. 29). We have probably an allusion to it in the lines of Horace (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 14).<p>"Ac sine funibus,<p>Vix durare carinae,<p>Possint imperiosius<p>quor."<p>["And scarcely can our keels keep sound,<p>E'en with the ropes that gird them round,<p>Against the imperious wave."]<p><span class= "bld">Fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the Syrtis.</span> There were two quicksands of this name, the Greater and the Lesser, on the north coast of Africa. The former lay just to the west of Cyrene, the latter further west, and nearer Carthage. St. Luke probably speaks of the Greater. These quicksands were the terror of all Mediterranean sailors (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 16, ? 4). A fine description of them is given by the Evangelist's namesake, Lucan, in his <span class= "ital">Pharsalia</span> (ix. 303-310):<p>"When Nature gave the world its primal form,<p>She left the Syrtes neither sea nor land.<p>There neither sinks the shore and welcomes in<p>The deep sea's waters, nor the coast can hold<p>Its own against the waves, and none can track<p>Their way within the uncertain region's bounds.<p>The seas are marred with shallows, and the land<p>Is broken by the billows, and the surge<p>Beats on the shore loud-sounding. Nature leaves<p>This spot accursed, and of use to none."<p>Comp. Milton's <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost, </span>ii. 939:<p>"Quenched in a boggy Syrtes, neither sea<p>Nor good dry land.<p>The voyagers knew that the gale was bearing them in that direction, and did not dare to let the ship sail on full before the wind any longer.<p><span class= "bld">Strake sail.</span>--The English fails to give the sense of the original. Had they struck sail altogether the ship would simply have drifted in the very direction which they were anxious to avoid. Some sail was absolutely necessary to keep the ship steady. What is meant is that they "lowered the ship's gear," the spars and rigging, and especially, perhaps, the heavy yard and ropes which the ancient ships carried, and which would, in such a gale, make the ship top-heavy.<p><span class= "bld">And so were driven.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">thus</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in this state, undergirded and with storm-sails set.

In medical language it is used of certain membranes which "under gird" and so strengthen and hold together certain parts of the human body, and specially was applied to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>. As regards the nautical sense in which St. Luke here uses the word, Dean Howson, in his excellent chapter (23.) on the 'Navigation and Ships of the Ancients,' writes as follows: - "In consequence of the extreme danger to which the ships of the ancients were exposed from leaking, it was customary to take to sea, as part of their ordinary gear, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, undergirders, which were simply ropes for passing round the hull of the ship, and thus preventing the planks from starting;" and he adds in a note that "within the last twenty years (in 1837) marble tables had been dug up in the Piraeus, containing a list of Athenian ships and an inventory of their tackle, and that they all carried, as part of their "hanging gear," <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. Another great ship described by Athenaeus carried twelve such. The operation of undergirding is still occasionally performed, and is called by seamen "frap- ping." The German word is <span class="accented">umgurten</span> (Howson). Among ether recent examples (Howson, p. 33) the <span class="accented">Albion</span> was frapped with iron chains after the battle of Navarino. <span class="cmt_word">Cast upon the Syrtis</span>. The wind was driving them straight toward the Syrtis Major, "the Goodwin Sands of the Mediterranean" (Farrar), and another twenty-four hours of such a gale might bring them there. The Syrtis Major was a wide gulf off the northern coast of Africa, now the Gulf of Sidra, lying between Tunis and Tripoli, considered very dangerous from its rocks and shoals. <span class="accented">Be east upon</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the classical word (Homer, Herodotus, Euripides) for being driven or thrown ashore, and is used in this sense in vers. 26, 29 of this chapter, and in a slightly different sense in ver. 32. <span class="cmt_word">They lowered the gear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is a very common word, variously rendered "goods," "stuff," "vessel," according to the <span class="accented">material</span> to which it is applied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-29.htm">Matthew 12:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-31.htm">Luke 17:31</a>, etc.). In the LXX. it is used of agricultural implements (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-20.htm">1 Samuel 13:20, 21</a>), of weapons of hunting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-3.htm">Genesis 27:3</a>), of household furniture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-37.htm">Genesis 31:37</a>), weapons of war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>), instruments of music (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>). This is the only passage in the Bible where it is used in its technical sense as a nautical term. In classical Greek, when applied generally to ships, it means the whole tackling, sails, ropes, yards, stores, engines, etc. The meaning, of course, is narrowed when applied to some particular part of the ship. Here, on the whole, it seems to mean the "great yard," or, if that had been already lowered, the heavy "head-gear," ropes, pulleys, and the like, which, under the circumstances, would contribute to make the ship roll and be unsteady. The word rendered "lowered" is <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It is rendered "let down" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-4.htm">Mark 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>; and ver. 30 of this chapter (A.V.). In the R.V. it is sometimes rendered "let down" and sometimes "lowered." In the LXX. it is used in the sense of "spreading" a sail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a>), which would be equivalent to "let down," if the sails were reefed at the top of the mast; and of "letting down" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>). The R.V., therefore, is correct. The object of what they did was to enable the ship to go as near the wind as possible, and with as little straining and rolling as possible. The operation is called by sailors "lying to." <span class="cmt_word">Were driven</span> (see ver. 15). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:12-20 Those who launch forth on the ocean of this world, with a fair gale, know not what storms they may meet with; and therefore must not easily take it for granted that they have obtained their purpose. Let us never expect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, and have no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only too heavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it. The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for the saving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means the sailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope of saving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and to trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.</body></html>
