The appeal is made to Moses in his two-fold character as lawgiver and prophet. As the words stand, taken with their context, they seem to point to the appearance of a succession of true prophets as contrasted with the diviners of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-14.htm" title="For these nations, which you shall possess, listened to observers of times, and to diviners: but as for you, the LORD your God has not suffered you so to do.">Deuteronomy 18:14</a>; and, even with St. Peter's interpretation before us, we may well admit those prophets as primary and partial fulfilments of them. But the words had naturally fixed the minds of men on the coming of some one great prophet who should excel all others, and we find traces of that expectation in the question put to the Baptist, "Art thou the prophet?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-21.htm" title="And they asked him, What then? Are you Elias? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.">John 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a>.) None that came between Moses and Jesus had been "like unto the former," as marking a new epoch, the channel of a new revelation, the giver of a new law.<p><span class= "bld">In all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</span>--The words are inserted by St. Peter as a parenthesis in the actual quotation, and suggest the thought of a quotation from memory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- Moses indeed said</span> for <span class="accented">Moses truly said unto the fathers</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">the Lord God</span> for <span class="accented">the Lord your God</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">from among</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to him shall ye hearken</span> for <span class="accented">him shall ye hear, A V.</span> ; <span class="accented">speak</span> for <span class="accented">say</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Moses indeed said</span>. Peter now verifies his assertion about the prophets in the previous verse by quoting from Moses, and referring to Samuel and those that came after. <span class="cmt_word">A prophet</span>, etc. The quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-18</a>. That this was understood by the Jews to relate to some one great prophet who had not yet come, appears from the question "Art thou that prophet?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>), and from the saying of the Jews after the miracle of the loaves and fishes, "This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>). St. Peter here teaches that that prophet was none other than Christ himself, who was like unto Moses in the fullness of the revelation given unto him, in his being a Mediator between God and the people, in being the Author of a new law - the law of faith and love, in building a new tabernacle for God to inhabit, even the Church in which he will dwell for ever and ever (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-26 Here is a powerful address to warn the Jews of the dreadful consequences of their unbelief, in the very words of Moses, their favourite prophet, out of pretended zeal for whom they were ready to reject Christianity, and to try to destroy it. Christ came into the world to bring a blessing with him. And he sent his Spirit to be the great blessing. Christ came to bless us, by turning us from our iniquities, and saving us from our sins. We, by nature cleave to sin; the design of Divine grace is to turn us from it, that we may not only forsake, but hate it. Let none think that they can be happy by continuing in sin, when God declares that the blessing is in being turned from all iniquity. Let none think that they understand or believe the gospel, who only seek deliverance from the punishment of sin, but do not expect happiness in being delivered from sin itself. And let none expect to be turned from their sin, except by believing in, and receiving Christ the Son of God, as their wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</body></html>
