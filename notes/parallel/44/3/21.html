This is the only passage in which the word translated "restitution" is found in the New Testament; nor is it found in the LXX. version of the Old. Etymologically, it conveys the thought of restoration to an earlier and better state, rather than that of simple consummation or completion, which the immediate context seems, in some measure, to suggest. It finds an interesting parallel in the "new heavens and new earth"--involving, as they do, a restoration of all things to their true order--of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a>. It does not necessarily involve, as some have thought, the final salvation of all men, but it does express the idea of a state in which "righteousness," and not "sin," shall have dominion over a redeemed and new created world; and that idea suggests a wider hope as to the possibilities of growth in wisdom and holiness, or even of repentance and conversion, in the unseen world than that with which Christendom has too often been content. The corresponding verb is found in the words, "Elias truly shall come first, and <span class= "ital">restore</span> all things" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a>); and St. Peter's words may well be looked on as an echo of that teaching, and so as an undesigned coincidence testifying to the truth of St. Matthew's record.<p><span class= "bld">Which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets.</span>--The relative, if we take the meaning given above, must be referred to the "times," not to "things." The words, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>, are, as it were, the utterance of a profound dogmatic truth.

The words take in the promises to Adam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>) and Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm" title="And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.">Genesis 22:18</a>). See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-70.htm" title="As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:">Luke 1:70</a>, of which St. Peter's words are as an echo.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> <span class="accented">- Restoration</span> for <span class="accented">restitution</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">whereof</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">spake</span> for <span class="accented">hath spoken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">his</span> for <span class="accented">all his</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Whom the heaven must receive</span>. This is clearly right, not as some render it, <span class="accented">who must occupy heaven.</span> The aorist <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> seems to point to the moment when, at the Ascension, he was carried up into heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-51.htm">Luke 24:51</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The restoration of all things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). This must be the same operation as our Lord speaks of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm">Matthew 17:11</a>: "Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) ;" and from the words of Malachi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5, 6</a>) it would seem to be a moral or spiritual restoration preparatory to the coming of the Lord. If so, the time of restoration is not exactly synchronous with the times of refreshing, but preparatory to them; preparatory, too, to that restoration of the kingdom to Israel of which the apostles spake to the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>). Probably, however, St. Peter includes in his view the immediately following times of" the presence of the Lord," just as in St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>) the preparatory mission of John the Baptist is included in the phrase, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Whereof God spake</span>. The antecedent to "whereof" is "the times" (ver. 24). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:19-21 The absolute necessity of repentance is to be solemnly charged upon the consciences of all who desire that their sins may be blotted out, and that they may share in the refreshment which nothing but a sense of Christ's pardoning love can afford. Blessed are those who have felt this. It was not needful for the Holy Spirit to make known the times and seasons of these dispensations. These subjects are still left obscure. But when sinners are convinced of their sins, they will cry to the Lord for pardon; and to the penitent, converted, and believing, times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord. In a state of trial and probation, the glorified Redeemer will be out of sight, because we must live by faith in him.</body></html>
