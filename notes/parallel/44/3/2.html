No gate of this name is mentioned by other writers, but it was probably identical either (1) with the gate of Nicanor (<span class= "ital">so</span> called, according to one tradition, because the hand of the great enemy of Judah had been nailed to it as a trophy), which was the main eastern entrance of the inner court (Stanley's <span class= "ital">Jewish Church, </span>iii. p. 323); or (2) the Susa gate, also on the eastern side, and named in memory of the old historical connection between Judah and Persia, leading into the outer court of the women. The latter was of fine Corinthian brass, so massive that twenty men were required to open or shut it (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>v. 5, ? 3).<p><span class= "bld">To ask alms of them that entered into the temple.</span>--The approaches of the Temple, like those of modern mosques, were commonly thronged with the blind, lame, and other mendicants.

If any distinction is intended between the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> here and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> of ver. 10 (which is not certain, as <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> is often used for a <span class="accented">gate</span>), we must understand <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of the double doors of the gate described by Josephus. Perhaps the lame man leant against one of the open doors. <span class="cmt_word">Which is called Beautiful</span>. It is not certain what gate this was. In the 'Dictionary of the Bible' it is described as "the great eastern gate leading from the court of the women to the upper court," following apparently Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5. 5:3. But it is impossible to reconcile Josephus's two accounts - that in the 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. and that in 'Ant. Jud.,' 15. 11. In the former he says distinctly that there were ten gates - four on the north, four on the south, and two on the east. In the latter he says there were three gates on the north, three on the south, and one on the east. In the former he says that fifteen steps led up <span class="accented">from</span> the women's enclosure to the great gate, exactly opposite the gate of the temple itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); in the latter he says very distinctly that women were allowed to enter through the great gate on the east. With such discrepancies in the description of the only eye-witness whose evidence has been preserved, it is impossible to speak with certainly. But it seems probable that there were two gates on the east - one the beautiful and costly gate of Corinthian brass, elaborately described by Josephus, through which the women did pass; the other the greater gate, just opposite to and above the beautiful gate (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), leading from the court of the women to the inner court; and that Josephus has confounded one with the other in his descriptions. Anyhow, the beautiful gate was probably on the east. Its correct name is said to be the gate of Nicanor. <span class="cmt_word">The temple</span>. It must be remembered that the whole platform, including the porches, and the courts of the Gentiles and of the women, and the outer court and the court of the priests, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; the actual house was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; that part of the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> to which only Israelites were admitted, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Josephus also divides the precincts into the first, second, and third <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The description of this lame man laid at the gate of the temple to ask alms is very similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a> of Lazarus laid at the rich man's gate; only that the word for <span class="accented">laid</span> is in St. Luke <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and here is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 The apostles and the first believers attended the temple worship at the hours of prayer. Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divine direction, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purpose the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter therein by his strength!</body></html>
