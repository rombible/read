The first affirms that it is the Name of Jesus which has given him strength, objectively; the second that the faith (subjective) which is <span class="accented">through</span> or <span class="accented">by</span> him hath given him perfect soundness. There is some obscurity in the exact meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. Some (see Alford, 1:1) compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>, and make God the object of the faith of his witnesses, Peter and John. Others (Meyer) understand that the faith in the Name of Christ was wrought in Peter and John by or through Christ's ministry and resurrection. But it is much more consonant with other passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-28.htm">Matthew 15:28</a>, etc.) to understand the faith to be that of the man who was healed; and then the phrase, "which is through him," will denote naturally that it was through Jesus Christ that the man's faith brought him into contact, so to speak, with God who healed him. In the same spirit we read that the lame man "praised God" (vers. 8, 9) for the cure effected through the Name of Jesus Christ; and Peter says (ver. 15), "Whom God raised from the <span class="accented">dead."</span> The interpretation of the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> depends upon whether we supply an active or a passive word. The faith which <span class="accented">acts</span>, or <span class="accented">works</span>, or <span class="accented">moves</span> through him is one way of understanding it; the faith which <span class="accented">is wrought</span> or <span class="accented">produced</span> through him is the other. The first is preferable. <span class="cmt_word">This perfect soundness</span>; pointing to what they saw with their own eyes while the man was leaping and dancing before them (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, perfect soundness, used only here in the New Testament; it is a medical term). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 Observe the difference in the manner of working the miracles. Our Lord always spoke as having Almighty power, never hesitated to receive the greatest honour that was given to him on account of his Divine miracles. But the apostles referred all to their Lord, and refused to receive any honour, except as his undeserving instruments. This shows that Jesus was one with the Father, and co-equal with Him; while the apostles knew that they were weak, sinful men, and dependent for every thing on Jesus, whose power effected the cure. Useful men must be very humble. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name, give glory. Every crown must be cast at the feet of Christ. The apostle showed the Jews the greatness of their crime, but would not anger or drive them to despair. Assuredly, those who reject, refuse, or deny Christ, do it through ignorance; but this can in no case be an excuse.</body></html>
