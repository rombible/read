And the blessing is found, not in mere exemption from punishment, not even in pardon and reconciliation, but in a change of heart, in "turning each man from his <span class= "ital">wickednesses."</span> The plural of the abstract noun implies, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-22.htm" title="Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:">Mark 7:22</a>, all the many concrete forms in which man's wickedness could show itself.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> <span class="accented">- Servant</span> for <span class="accented">Son Jesus</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">your</span> for <span class="accented">his</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Unto you first</span>.

As regards the phrase, "having raised up," however natural it is at first sight to understand it of the raising from the dead, the tenses make it impossible to do so. Nor could it be said that God <span class="accented">sent</span> Jesus to bless them after his resurrection. We must, therefore, understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> as to be equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and to mean "having appointed," set up, raised up (as the English word is used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).

Christ came into the world to bring a blessing with him. And he sent his Spirit to be the great blessing. Christ came to bless us, by turning us from our iniquities, and saving us from our sins. We, by nature cleave to sin; the design of Divine grace is to turn us from it, that we may not only forsake, but hate it. Let none think that they can be happy by continuing in sin, when God declares that the blessing is in being turned from all iniquity. Let none think that they understand or believe the gospel, who only seek deliverance from the punishment of sin, but do not expect happiness in being delivered from sin itself. And let none expect to be turned from their sin, except by believing in, and receiving Christ the Son of God, as their wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</body></html>
