He speaks to the "men of Israel," and he connects the present miracle with all that God had (lone to their fathers in days gone by. He does not seem conscious of any break or transition, or of any change of posture or position. Only a new incident, long since promised by the prophets, has been added. "tie thrusts himself upon the fathers of old, lest he should appear to be introducing a new doctrine" (Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">God... hath glorified his Servant Jesus</span>. <span class="accented">Servant</span> is manifestly right (so St. Chrysostom). It is the constant meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX.; <span class="accented">son</span> is always <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see ver. 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27, 30</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm">Matthew 12:18</a> the A.V. has "servant." (For the Old Testament usage, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Delivered up</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, different from the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a> (where see note). The word is applied to the action of Judas in delivering up Jesus into the hands of the chief priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>), and to the action of Pilate in sending Jesus to execution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-25.htm">Luke 23:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-16.htm">John 19:16</a>). Here it is spoken of the whole action of the Jews in procuring the death of Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">Denied before the face of Pilate</span>. The reference is exact to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-13.htm">Luke 23:13-23</a>. To release him. There is a verbal agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-16.htm">Luke 23:16, 17, 20</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 Observe the difference in the manner of working the miracles. Our Lord always spoke as having Almighty power, never hesitated to receive the greatest honour that was given to him on account of his Divine miracles. But the apostles referred all to their Lord, and refused to receive any honour, except as his undeserving instruments. This shows that Jesus was one with the Father, and co-equal with Him; while the apostles knew that they were weak, sinful men, and dependent for every thing on Jesus, whose power effected the cure. Useful men must be very humble. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name, give glory. Every crown must be cast at the feet of Christ. The apostle showed the Jews the greatness of their crime, but would not anger or drive them to despair. Assuredly, those who reject, refuse, or deny Christ, do it through ignorance; but this can in no case be an excuse.</body></html>
