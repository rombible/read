In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a> we meet with it in "the <span class= "ital">Captain</span> of their salvation;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>, in "the <span class= "ital">Author</span> and Finisher of our faith." Its primary meaning, like that of prince (<span class= "ital">princeps</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>is one who takes the lead--who is the originator of that to which the title is attached. The "Prince of life," the "Captain of salvation," is accordingly He who is the source from which life and salvation flow. In the LXX. of the Old Testament it is used for the "chieftains" or "princes" of Moab and the like (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-3.htm" title="And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.">Numbers 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Whereof we are witnesses.</span>--St. Peter falls back, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-32.htm" title="This Jesus has God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.">Acts 2:32</a> (where see Note), on this attestation to the one central fact.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="accented">- Raised</span> for <span class="accented">bath raised</span>, A.V<span class="cmt_word">. The Prince of life</span>; a remarkable title here given to our Lord, to bring out the contrast between him whom they preferred and him whom they rejected. Barabbas was a murderer, one who took away human life for his own base ends; the other was the Prince and Author of life, who was come into the world, not to destroy men's lives, but to save them. This title, taken in connection with the preceding declaration, "God hath glorified his Servant Jesus," seems almost to be a reminiscence of our Savior's prayer," Father,... glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1, 2</a>). Jesus himself in very many places dwells upon his own great prerogative of giving life: "I am come that they might have life, and.., have it more abundantly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>); "I am that Bread of life;" "I am the living Bread ... if any man cat of this bread, he shall live for ever;" "I give... my flesh for the life of the world;" "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life;" "They that hear shall live;" "As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;" "The Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should... have eternal life;" "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> applied to Christ is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, rendered the "<span class="accented">Author</span> or <span class="accented">Captain</span> of their salvation," "of our faith." <span class="cmt_word">Whereof we are witnesses</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>, note). The marginal rendering <span class="accented">of</span> whom is equally literal, and may be defended by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-31.htm">Acts 13:31</a>; but the rendering <span class="accented">whereof</span> is in accordance with the more frequent phrases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39</a>, etc.). The meaning is practically the same. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 Observe the difference in the manner of working the miracles. Our Lord always spoke as having Almighty power, never hesitated to receive the greatest honour that was given to him on account of his Divine miracles. But the apostles referred all to their Lord, and refused to receive any honour, except as his undeserving instruments. This shows that Jesus was one with the Father, and co-equal with Him; while the apostles knew that they were weak, sinful men, and dependent for every thing on Jesus, whose power effected the cure. Useful men must be very humble. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name, give glory. Every crown must be cast at the feet of Christ. The apostle showed the Jews the greatness of their crime, but would not anger or drive them to despair. Assuredly, those who reject, refuse, or deny Christ, do it through ignorance; but this can in no case be an excuse.</body></html>
