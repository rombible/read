It consisted, in the Herodian Temple, of a double row of Corinthian columns, about thirty-seven feet high, and received its name as having been in part constructed, when the Temple was rebuilt by Zerubbabel, with the fragments of the older edifice. The people tried to persuade Herod Agrippa the First to pull it down and rebuild it, but he shrank from the risk and cost of such an undertaking (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 9, ? 7). It was, like the porticos in all Greek cities, a favourite place of resort, especially as facing the morning sun in winter. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-23.htm" title="And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.">John 10:23</a>.) The memory of what had then been the result of their Master's teaching must have been fresh in the minds of the two disciples. Then the people had complained of being kept in suspense as to whether Jesus claimed to be the Christ, and, when He spoke of being One with the Father, had taken up stones to stone Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31-33</a>). Now they were to hear His name as Holy and Just, as "the Servant of Jehovah," as the very Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/3-13.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.">Acts 3:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-18.htm" title="But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has so fulfilled.">Acts 3:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - He for <span class="accented">the lame man which was healed</span>, A.V. and T.R.

Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divine direction, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purpose the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter therein by his strength!</body></html>
