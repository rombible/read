The use of the middle voice for "be converted," gives the word the same force as in the "turn yourselves" of the older prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm" title="Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.">Ezekiel 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-30.htm" title="Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, said the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.">Ezekiel 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm" title="For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, said the Lord GOD: why turn yourselves, and live you.">Ezekiel 18:32</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That your sins may be blotted out.</span>--This is the only passage in which the verb is directly connected with sins. The image that underlies the words (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>) is that of an indictment which catalogues the sins of the penitent, and which the pardoning love of the Father cancels. The word and the thought are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm" title="Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.">Psalm 51:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm" title="I, even I, am he that blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember your sins.">Isaiah 43:25</a>.<p><span class= "bld">When the times of refreshing shall come.</span>--Better, "<span class= "ital">that so</span> the times of refreshing may come." The Greek conjunction never has the force of "when." The thought is that again expressed both by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2Peter 3:12</a>) and by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25-27</a>); that the conversion of sinners, especially the conversion of Israel, will have a power to accelerate the fulfilment of God's purposes, and, therefore, the coming of His kingdom in its completeness. The word for "refreshing" is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but the cognate verb meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2Timothy 1:16</a>. In the Greek version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>, it stands where we have "respite." The "times of refreshing" are distinguished from the "restitution of all things" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a>, and would seem to be, as it were, the gracious preludes of that great consummation. The souls of the weary would be quickened as by the fresh breeze of morning; the fire of persecution assuaged as by "a moist whistling wind" (Song of the Three Children, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-24.htm" title="Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.">Acts 3:24</a>). Israel, as a nation, did not repent, and therefore hatred and strife went on to the bitter end without refreshment. For every church, or nation, or family, those "times of refreshing" come as the sequel of a true conversion, and prepare the way for a more complete restoration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- Turn again</span> for <span class="accented">be converted</span>, A.V., with no difference in sense; <span class="accented">that so there may come seasons of refreshing</span> for <span class="accented">when the times of refreshing shall come</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Turn again</span>.

"when," etc., which the Greek cannot mean. What Peter conceives is that if Israel turns to God at once in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, then there will come at once those times of refreshing, those blessed days of righteousness, and peace, and rest, and universal joy, which are the characteristics of Christ's kingdom as foretold by the prophets. Those days are delayed by the unbelief of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Seasons of refreshing</span>. The A.V." times of refreshing" is manifestly right, though there is no article in the Greek. "Seasons of refreshing" seems very vague and vapid (see Alford, 1:1, who very appropriately and conclusively cites the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "the times of the Gentiles"(<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>).

Blessed are those who have felt this. It was not needful for the Holy Spirit to make known the times and seasons of these dispensations. These subjects are still left obscure. But when sinners are convinced of their sins, they will cry to the Lord for pardon; and to the penitent, converted, and believing, times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord.
