Either, therefore, we must assume that the words meant that they had no silver or gold with them at the time, or that, as almoners, they thought themselves bound to distribute what was thus given them in trust, for the benefit of members of the society of which they were officers and for them only. They, obeying their Lord's commands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-9.htm" title="Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,">Matthew 10:9</a>), had no money that they could call their own to give to those that asked them. But they could give more than money.<p><span class= "bld">In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth . . . .</span>--The full trust with which the words were spoken was in part a simple act of faith in their Master's promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-18.htm" title="They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.">Mark 16:18</a>), in part the result of a past experience in the exercise of like powers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-13.htm" title="And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.">Mark 6:13</a>). And the Name in which they spoke could hardly have been a new name to the cripple. Among the beggars at the Temple-gate there had once been the blind man who received his sight at the pool of Siloam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.">John 9:7-8</a>). The healing of the cripple at Bethesda (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-2.htm" title="Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.">John 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-14.htm" title="Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you.">John 5:14</a>) could scarcely have been unknown to the sufferer from a like infirmity. What made the call to rise and walk a test of faith was that, but a few weeks before, that Name had been seen on the superscription over the cross on which He who bore it had been condemned to die as one that deceived the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-12.htm" title="And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.">John 7:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">what I have that</span> for <span class="accented">such as I have</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">walk</span> for <span class="accented">rise up and walk</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth</span>. What Peter meant by "in the Name," he clearly explains in vers. 12 and 16, where he shows that they did not work the miracle by their own power or godliness, but that the lame man was healed by the Name of Jesus, in which he believed. So our Lord said of himself, "<span class="cmt_word">I</span> am come in my Father's Name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25</a>) Observe the full designation of our Lord as "Jesus Christ of Nazareth" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-10.htm">Acts 4:10</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-23.htm">Matthew 11:23</a>.

Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divine direction, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purpose the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter therein by his strength!</body></html>
