The sequence of events implies that it was not the Apostle, but his namesake who had been chosen as one of the Seven. As having been conspicuous in the work of "preaching the glad tidings of Christ," he was afterwards known as Philip the Evangelist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>). It was natural enough that the identity of name should lead writers who were imperfectly informed to confuse the two, as Polycrates, Bishop of Ephesus, seems to have done in the passage quoted by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist.</span> iii. 31). The "city of Samaria" is described in precisely the same terms as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>, where it is identified with Sychar, the Sichem of the Old Testament. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>.) "Samaria," throughout the New Testament (as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-31.htm" title="Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.">Luke 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-4.htm" title="And he must needs go through Samaria.">John 4:4-5</a>), is used for the province, and not for the city to which it had been attached in earlier times. This had been new-named <span class= "ital">Sebaste</span> (the Greek equivalent of Augusta) by Herod the Great in honour of the Emperor, and this had more or less superseded the old name (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xv.</span> 8, ? 5). Assuming the identity with Sychar, the narrative of John 4 suggests at once the reason that probably determined Philip's choice. The seed had already been sown, and the fields were white for harvest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>). Possibly, as suggested above (Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm" title="And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.">Acts 7:16</a>), there may have been some previous connection with the district. Some of that city had already accepted Jesus as the Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Preached Christ.</span>--The verb is not the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm" title="Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.">Acts 8:4</a>, and is the word used for "preaching" or "proclaiming." The tense implies continued action, extending, it may be, over weeks or months. We find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a> that the expectation of the Messiah was as strong among the Samaritans as among the Jews, and Philip's work therefore was to proclaim that the long-expected One had come, and that the Resurrection was the crowning proof that He was the Christ the Son of God. The readiness with which the proclamation was accepted shows that in spite of the adverse influence which had come into play since our Lord had taught there, the work then done had not been in vain.<p><span class= "bld">Hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the signs, </span>as being closer, here as elsewhere, to the force of the Greek. It is remarkable that they had believed in the first instance without any other sign than the person and the teaching of the Lord Jesus. Miracles came not as the foundation, but for the strengthening of their faith; perhaps also as a corrective to the adverse influence of which we are so soon to hear.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">proclaimed unto them the Christ</span> for <span class="accented">preached Christ unto them</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Philip</span>; the deacon and evangelist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>), not the apostle. As regards Samaria, it is always used in the New Testament of the country, not of the city, which at this time was called Sebaste, from <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Augustus Caesar (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-21.htm">Acts 25:21, 26</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>; and Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 15. 7:9). Whether, therefore, we read with the T.R. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, or with the R.T. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, we must understand <span class="accented">Samaria</span> to mean the country, and probably the city to be the capital, Sebaste. Alford, however, with many others, thinks that Sychem is meant, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 As far as the gospel prevails, evil spirits are dislodged, particularly unclean spirits. All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe the gospel.</body></html>
