A different meaning has, however, been given to the Hebrew preposition by many scholars, who render the words, "<span class= "ital">Through</span> oppression and [unjust] judgment He was taken away"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>He was the victim of a judicial murder. The LXX., which is here followed, seems to have adopted a different construction, "By His humiliation, by His low estate, His judgment (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the righteous judgment which was His due) was taken away." Here also, however, the word "judgment" has been taken in a different sense, and the words have been interpreted as meaning, "His condemnation was taken away, or cancelled"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>because He humbled Himself He was afterwards exalted. Assuming Philip to have explained the words as they stand in the LXX., the first of these two latter interpretations has most to commend itself. The story of the Passion, the unrighteous sentence passed on the Lord Jesus because He stood before the Council and the Governor as poor and friendless, would be dwelt on as filling in the outlines of the prophetic picture.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall declare his generation?</span>--The Hebrew noun may mean, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm" title="There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.">Psalm 14:5</a>, the men of a given period, or those sharing a common character. The words have, however, been very variously taken: (1) "Who shall declare the number of those who share His life, and are, as it were, sprung from Him"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Who can count His faithful disciples? (2) "Who shall declare the wickedness of the crooked and perverse generation in which He lived?" (3) "Who, as far as His generation went, were wise enough to consider?" Assuming, as before, that it was the LXX. that Philip explained, the second of these seems preferable, as corresponding with the frequent use of the word "generation" with condemnatory epithets attached to it both by our Lord Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39-42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm" title="A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.">Matthew 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-17.htm" title="Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him here to me.">Matthew 17:17</a>) and His Apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-40.htm" title="And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.">Acts 2:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm" title="That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;">Philippians 2:15</a>). The sense which some commentators have affixed to it, "Who shall declare His duration?" "Who shall set limits to the life of Him who is One with the Eternal?" or, as others, "Who shall declare the mystery of His mode of birth?"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the Incarnation--are, it is believed, untenable as regards the Hebrew, and yet more so as regards the Greek.<p><span class= "bld">For his life is taken from the earth.</span>--The Hebrew admits of no other meaning than that the Sufferer was hurried to a violent death. The fact that in being thus taken from the earth the Sufferer was exalted to heaven, though true in itself, cannot be found in the words.<p>We are not concerned here with a detailed explanation, either of the words that precede, or those that follow, the passage quoted in Isaiah 53, but it is difficult to think of Philip as not taking in context as well as text, and unfolding in full, not only the fact of the Passion, but its atoning and redeeming power, as set forth in the prophet's marvellous prediction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="accented">- His generation who shall declare?</span> for <span class="accented">and who shall declare his generation?</span> A.V. and T.R. The preceding quotation is taken verbatim from the LXX., which, however, varies somewhat from the Hebrew. In this verse, for the Hebrew as rendered in the A.V., "He was taken from prison and from judgment," the LXX. has, "In his humiliation his judgment was taken away," having evidently read in their copy <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;</span>, or perhaps <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span>, "Through [or, 'in'] his oppression [humiliation] his judgment was taken away." Mr. Cheyne translates the Hebrew, "Through oppression and through a judgment [sentence] he was taken "away [to death]." For the Hebrew of the A.V., "He was cut off out of the land of the living," the LXX. has, "His life is taken from the earth," where they must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, "his life," as the subject of the verb, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the living, taken in construction with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e5;</span> , the earth. The differences, however, are not material in regard to the general meaning of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">His generation who shall declare</span>? The explanation of this difficult expression belongs tea commentary on Isaiah. Here it must suffice to say that the explanation most in accordance with the meaning of the Hebrew words (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span>), with the context, and with the turn of thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10-12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>, is that given in the 'Speaker's Commentary:' "Who will consider, give serious thought to, his life or age, seeing it is so prematurely cut off?" which is merely another way of saying that Messiah should "be cut off" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>)" from the land of the living, that his Name be no more remembered" (Jeremiah, as above). It was the frustration of this hope of Jesus being forgotten in consequence of his death that so troubled the Sanhedrim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:26-40 Philip was directed to go to a desert. Sometimes God opens a door of opportunity to his ministers in very unlikely places. We should study to do good to those we come into company with by travelling. We should not be so shy of all strangers as some affect to be. As to those of whom we know nothing else, we know this, that they have souls. It is wisdom for men of business to redeem time for holy duties; to fill up every minute with something which will turn to a good account. In reading the word of God, we should often pause, to inquire of whom and of what the sacred writers spake; but especially our thoughts should be employed about the Redeemer. The Ethiopian was convinced by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, of the exact fulfilment of the Scripture, was made to understand the nature of the Messiah's kingdom and salvation, and desired to be numbered among the disciples of Christ. Those who seek the truth, and employ their time in searching the Scriptures, will be sure to reap advantages. The avowal of the Ethiopian must be understood as expressing simple reliance on Christ for salvation, and unreserved devotion to Him. Let us not be satisfied till we get faith, as the Ethiopian did, by diligent study of the Holy Scriptures, and the teaching of the Spirit of God; let us not be satisfied till we get it fixed as a principle in our hearts. As soon as he was baptized, the Spirit of God took Philip from him, so that he saw him no more; but this tended to confirm his faith. When the inquirer after salvation becomes acquainted with Jesus and his gospel, he will go on his way rejoicing, and will fill up his station in society, and discharge his duties, from other motives, and in another manner than heretofore. Though baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, with water, it is not enough without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Lord, grant this to every one of us; then shall we go on our way rejoicing.</body></html>
