It is probable enough that he was impressed by the signs that Philip wrought; that he felt himself in the presence of a Power above his own; that he accepted Philip's statements as to the death and resurrection of the Christ. It was such a faith as that of which St. James speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?">James 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-19.htm" title="You believe that there is one God; you do well: the devils also believe, and tremble.">James 2:19</a>). If we are to use the definite language of theological science, it would be true to say that he had the <span class= "ital">fides informis, </span>faith not preceded by repentance and not perfected by love. And baptism, in such a case, the expressed or implied conditions being absent, brought with it no new birth to a higher life. He remained still "in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm" title="For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.">Acts 8:23</a>). But even for him it bore its witness of the readiness of God to forgive and to regenerate. The subsequent fulfilment of the conditions which were then absent would have quickened the potential into an actual grace, and no second baptism would have been needed to supplement the shortcomings of the first. Peter calls on him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-22.htm" title="Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.">Acts 8:22</a>) to repent and pray for forgiveness. He does not tell him that he must be baptised again.<p><span class= "bld">And wondered.</span>--The verb is the same as that rendered "bewitched" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm" title="And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.">Acts 8:11</a>. The tables were turned. The magician yielded to a spell mightier than his own, and was, in his turn, as one beside himself with amazement. The difference between Simon and the believing Samaritans is, in this matter, suggestive. His faith rested on outward miracles. With them the miracles did but serve to confirm a faith which rested on the "prophetic word" as spoken by the Son of Man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-42.htm" title="And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.">John 4:42</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">also himself believed</span> for <span class="accented">himself believed also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">being baptized</span> for <span class="accented">when he was baptized</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed</span> for <span class="accented">wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</span> Contained with (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; 3:46; 6:4; 10.7.

In Simon we have the first example of one who, having been baptized into Jesus Christ, lived to disgrace and corrupt the faith which he professed. He was an instance of the tares sown among the wheat, and of the seed which sprang up quickly being as quickly destroyed. He is an instance also of the truth of our Lord's raying, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 As far as the gospel prevails, evil spirits are dislodged, particularly unclean spirits. All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe the gospel.</body></html>
