For the present it will be convenient to deal only with the materials which St. Luke gives us, reserving a fuller account for the close of the narrative. Nothing is told us here as to his earlier history, prior to his arrival in Samaria. The name indicates Jewish or Samaritan origin. He appears as the type of a class but too common at the time, that of Jews trading on the mysterious <span class= "ital">prestige</span> of their race and the credulity of the heathen, claiming supernatural power exercised through charms and incantations. Such afterwards was Elymas at Cyprus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:">Acts 13:6</a>); such were the vagabond Jews exorcists at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13</a>); such was a namesake, Simon of Cyprus (unless, indeed, we have a re-appearance of the same man), who also claimed to be a magician, and who pandered to the vices of Felix, the Procurator of Judaea, by persuading Drusilla (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 7, ? 2, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm" title="And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.">Acts 24:24</a>) to leave her first husband and to marry him. The life of such a man, like that of the Cagliostro fraternity in all ages, was a series of strange adventures, and startling as the statements as to his previous life may seem (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-24.htm" title="Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.">Acts 8:24</a>), they are not in themselves incredible. Apollonius of Tyana is, perhaps, the supreme representative of the charlatanism of the period.<p><span class= "bld">Used sorcery.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">was practising magic.</span> On the history of the Greek word <span class= "ital">magos</span> and our "magic," as derived from it, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-1.htm" title="Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,">Matthew 2:1</a>. Our "sorcerer" comes, through the French <span class= "ital">sorcier, </span>from the Latin <span class= "ital">sortitor, </span>a caster of lots (<span class= "ital">sortes</span>) for the purposes of divination. Later legends enter fully into the various forms of sorcery of which Simon made use. (See below.)<p><span class= "bld">Bewitched the people of Samaria.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">threw them into the state of trance or ecstasy; set them beside themselves, </span>or <span class= "ital">out of their wits.</span> The structure of the sentence shows that the "city" is not identical with Samaria, and that the latter name is used, as elsewhere, for the region.<p><span class= "bld">Giving out that himself was some great one.</span>--The next verse defines the nature of the claim more clearly. The cry of the people that he was "the great power of God," was, we may well believe, the echo of his own boast. He claimed to be, in some undefined way, an Incarnation of Divine Power. The very name had appeared in our Lord's teaching when He spoke of Himself as sitting on the right hand of "the Power of God," as an equivalent for the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-69.htm" title="Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.">Luke 22:69</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Simon by name</span> for <span class="accented">called Simon</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the city</span> for <span class="accented">the same city</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">amazed</span> for <span class="accented">bewitched</span>, A.V. (here and in ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">Amazed.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-22.htm">Luke 24:22</a> the same word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>) is rendered "made us astonished" in the A.V.; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-7.htm">Acts 2:7, 12</a>, and elsewhere, in an intransitive sense, "were amazed." It has also the meaning of "being out of one's mind," or "beside one's self" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm">2 Corinthians 5:13</a>), but never that of "bewitching" or "being bewitched." As regards <span class="cmt_word">Simon</span>, commonly surnamed Magus, from his magic arts, it is doubtful whether he is the same Simon as is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,'20. 7:2) as being employed by Felix the Procurator of Judaea, in the reign of Claudius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-25.htm">Acts 23:25</a>), to bewitch Drusfila into forsaking her husband, King Azizus, and marrying him, which she did (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>). The doubt arises from Josephus stating <span class="accented">that</span> Simon to be a Cypriot (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), whereas Justin Martyr says of Simon Magus that he was <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, a native of Gitton, or Githon, a village of Samaria. It has been thought that Gitton may be a mistake of Justin's for Citium, in Cyprus (Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 260, 352; Alford, etc.). The after history of Simon Magus is full of fable. He is spoken of by Irenaeus and other early writers as the inventor or founder of heresy. (For a list of authorities concerning Simon, see Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 260, note; Alford, 1:6; 'Bible Dictionary; 'and a good article in 'Dict. of Biog. and Mythol.') <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 As far as the gospel prevails, evil spirits are dislodged, particularly unclean spirits. All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe the gospel.</body></html>
