(1) His conscience reads "between the lines" of St. Peter's address what was not actually found there. That "if perhaps" is to him as the knell of doom. (2) He prays not for deliverance from "the bond of iniquity," but only from the vague terror of a future penalty. (3) He turns, not, as Peter had bidden him, to the Lord who was ready to forgive, but to a human mediator. Peter must pray for him who has not faith to pray for himself.<p>At this point Simon disappears from the history of the Acts, and this seems accordingly the right place for stating briefly the later traditions as to his history. In those traditions he occupies a far more prominent position than in St. Luke's narrative, and becomes, as it has been said, the "hero of the romance of heresy," as given in the <span class= "ital">Homilies</span> and <span class= "ital">Recognitions</span> of the Pseudo-Clement. Born at Gittom, in Samaria (Justin, <span class= "ital">Apol.</span> i. 26), he received his education at Alexandria, and picked up the language of a mystic Gnosticism from Dositheus (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> ii. c. 22; <span class= "ital">Constt. Apost.</span> vi. 8). He had for a short time been a disciple of the Baptist (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> c. 23). He murdered a boy that the soul of his victim might become his familiar spirit, and give him insight into the future (<span class= "ital">Hom. ii.</span> c. 26; <span class= "ital">Recogn.</span> ii. 9). He carried about with him a woman of great beauty, of the name of Luna or Helena, whom he represented as a kind of incarnation of the Wisdom or Thought of God (Justin, <span class= "ital">Apol. i.</span> 6; <span class= "ital">Hom.</span> ii. c. 25; Euseb. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 13). He identified himself with the promised Paraclete and the Christ, and took the name of "<span class= "ital">He who stands</span>," as indicating divine power (<span class= "ital">Recogn. ii.</span> 7). He boasted that he could turn himself and others into the form of brute beasts; that he could cause statues to speak (<span class= "ital">Hom. iv.</span> c. 4; <span class= "ital">Recogn.</span> ii. 9, iii. 6). His life was one of ostentatious luxury. He was accompanied by the two sons of the Syro-Ph?nician woman of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-26.htm" title="The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she sought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.">Mark 7:26</a> (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> i. 19). After the episode related <span class= "ital">in</span> the Acts, he went down to Caesarea, and Peter was then sent thither by James, the Bishop of Jerusalem, to confront and hold a disputation with him on various points of doctrine. From Caesarea he made his way to Tyre and Tripolis, and thence to Rome, and was there worshipped by his followers, so that an altar was seen there by Justin with an inscription, "SIMONI DEO SANCTO" (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> i. 56). Peter followed him, and in the reign of Claudius the two met, once more face to face, in the imperial city. According to one legend, he offered to prove his divinity by flying in the air. trusting that the demons whom he employed would support him; but, through the power of the prayers of Peter, he fell down, and had his bones broken, and then committed suicide (<span class= "ital">Constt. Apost.</span> ii. 14; 6:9). Another represents him as buried alive at his own request, in order that he might show his power by rising on the third day from the dead, and so meeting his death (Irenaeus, <span class= "ital">Adv. Haer</span>. vi. 20).<p>In the midst of all this chaos of fantastic fables, we have, perhaps, one grain of fact in Justin's assertion that he had seen the altar above referred to. An altar was discovered at Rome in 1574, on the island in the Tiber, with the inscription "SEMONI SANCO DEO FIDIO." Archaeologists, however, agree in thinking that this was dedicated to the Sabine Hercules, who was known as SEMO SANCUS, and it has been thought by many writers that Justin may have seen this or some like altar, and, in his ignorance of Italian mythology, have imagined that it was consecrated to the Sorcerer of Samaria. His statement is repeated by Tertullian (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> c. 13) and Irenaeus (i. 20). Of the three names in the inscription, Semo (probably connected with <span class= "ital">Semen</span> as the God of Harvest, or as <span class= "ital">Semihomo</span>) appears by itself in the Hymn of the Fratres Arvales, and in connection with Sancus and Fidius (probably connected with <span class= "ital">Fides, </span>and so employed in the formula of asseveration, <span class= "ital">medius fidius</span>) in Ovid, <span class= "ital">Fast.</span> vi. 213; Livy, viii. 20; 32:1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - And <span class="accented">Simon answered</span> for <span class="accented">then answered Simon</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">.for me to the Lord</span> for <span class="accented">to the Lord for me</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the</span> for <span class="accented">these</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Pray ye</span>, etc.; addressed to both Peter and John, who were acting together, and whose prayers had been seen to be effectual (ver. 15) in procuring the gift of the Holy Ghost. In like manner, Pharaoh, under the influence of terror at God's judgments, had asked again and again for the prayers of Moses and Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-16.htm">Exodus 10:16, 17</a>, etc.). But in neither ease was this an evidence of true conversion of heart. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-25 The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of these coverts, in the extraordinary powers conveyed by the descent of the Spirit upon the day of Pentecost. We may take encouragement from this example, in praying to God to give the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to all for whose spiritual welfare we are concerned; for that includes all blessings. No man can give the Holy Spirit by the laying on of his hands; but we should use our best endeavours to instruct those for whom we pray. Simon Magus was ambitious to have the honour of an apostle, but cared not at all to have the spirit and disposition of a Christian. He was more desirous to gain honour to himself, than to do good to others. Peter shows him his crime. He esteemed the wealth of this world, as if it would answer for things relating to the other life, and would purchase the pardon of sin, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. This was such a condemning error as could by no means consist with a state of grace. Our hearts are what they are in the sight of God, who cannot be deceived. And if they are not right in his sight, our religion is vain, and will stand us in no stead. A proud and covetous heart cannot be right with God. It is possible for a man to continue under the power of sin, yet to put on a form of godliness. When tempted with money to do evil, see what a perishing thing money is, and scorn it. Think not that Christianity is a trade to live by in this world. There is much wickedness in the thought of the heart, its false notions, and corrupt affections, and wicked projects, which must be repented of, or we are undone. But it shall be forgiven, upon our repentance. The doubt here is of the sincerity of Simon's repentance, not of his pardon, if his repentance was sincere. Grant us, Lord, another sort of faith than that which made Simon wonder only, and did not sanctify his heart. May we abhor all thoughts of making religion serve the purposes of pride or ambition. And keep us from that subtle poison of spiritual pride, which seeks glory to itself even from humility. May we seek only the honour which cometh from God.</body></html>
