St. Luke, however, always uses a different word to describe that class (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-43.htm" title="Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.">Acts 13:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm" title="And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the things which were spoken of Paul.">Acts 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-17.htm" title="Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.">Acts 17:17</a>), and the word used here is applied by him to Simeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>), to the multitude of Jews present on the day of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a>), to Ananias as devout according to the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-12.htm" title="And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelled there,">Acts 22:12</a>). This notion must accordingly be rejected as against evidence. On the other hand, had they been members of the Church they would naturally, though perhaps not necessarily, have been described as "brethren" or "disciples." We are left therefore to the conclusion that they were Jews who had been kindled into admiration and half-conviction by the calm heroism of the martyr, and who, without committing themselves to more than that admiration, acted in his case as Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea had acted after the Crucifixion. They would show honour to the memory of the dead, though they had not had the courage to defend the preacher of the truth while he was yet with them. In the legend or tradition as to the death of Stephen, reported and accepted by Augustine (<span class= "ital">De Civ:</span> <span class= "ital">Dei.</span> xvii. 8; <span class= "ital">Serm.</span> 318, 319; <span class= "ital">Tract. In Joann., </span>120), Gamaliel and Nicodemus are named as actually taking part in the entombment, and as afterwards laid in the same sepulchre, on which his name appeared in Aramaic characters as <span class= "ital">Chaliel</span> (= garland), the equivalent in that language of the Greek <span class= "ital">Stephanos.</span> The translation of the martyr's relics to Ancona, Minorca, and to Uzalis, and other towns in Africa, made a deep impression on Augustine, and gave occasion to some of his most eloquent sermons. Oratories were dedicated to his memory, and miraculous cures effected by prayers addressed to him. (See Butler's <span class= "ital">Lives of the Saints, </span>Aug. 3rd.)<p><span class= "bld">And made great lamentation over him.</span>--The act was every way significant. Commonly, one who had been stoned to death on the charge of blasphemy would have had no funereal honours. He would have been buried "with the burial of an ass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-19.htm" title="He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). The public lamentation on the part of men conspicuous for their devout zeal for the Law, was therefore of the nature of a protest, probably on the part of the more moderate section of the Pharisees, such as Joseph, Nicodemus, and Gamaliel, against what would seem to them the unnatural coalition between the Sadducean priesthood and the ultra-zealot section of their own party.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- Buried</span> for <span class="accented">carried to his burial</span> (the last three words in italics), A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Devout men</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. This word is applied to Simeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>), and to the Jews who were assembled at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>), and, according to the R.T., to Ananias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-12.htm">Acts 22:12</a>); but occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It is not certain, therefore, that these men were Christians, though they might be. If not, they were pious Jews, men who feared God, and still loved Stephen as being himself a devout Jew though he was a disciple. <span class="cmt_word">Buried</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> occurs only here in the New Testament; but its common use for carrying corn to a barn or granary seems to indicate that "carrying to his burial" of the A.V. is the most exact rendering. The word is said also to be applied to the acts preparatory to burial - closing the eyes, washing, anointing the body, and so on; but this meaning is less certain than that of "carrying." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-4 Though persecution must not drive us from our work, yet it may send us to work elsewhere. Wherever the established believer is driven, he carries the knowledge of the gospel, and makes known the preciousness of Christ in every place. Where a simple desire of doing good influences the heart, it will be found impossible to shut a man out from all opportunities of usefulness.</body></html>
