Rightly understood, the call to repent in such a case as this, opens the door of hope as wide as the history of the penitent thief. Repentance, and with repentance, forgiveness, were possible, even for the charlatan adventurer who had traded on the credulous superstition of the people, and claimed something like adoration for himself and his mistress.<p><span class= "bld">Pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart . . . .</span>--The better MSS. give "Lord" instead of "God," either in the Old Testament sense of the word or with special reference to the Lord Jesus. The "if perhaps," in the Greek, as in the English, implies a latent doubt. Did the thought come across the mind of the Apostle that the sin of Simon came very near that "sin against the Holy Ghost which hath never forgiveness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-31.htm" title="Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.">Matthew 12:31</a>)? The use of such words by the chief of the Apostles, after the apparent concession of a plenary power in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-23.htm" title="Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.">John 20:23</a>, are terribly suggestive. He neither forgives nor condemns, but bids the offender turn to the Searcher of hearts and pray for forgiveness. Had he seen repentance, he might have said, "Thy sins are forgiven thee." Had he seen a conscience utterly dead, he might have closed the door of hope. As it is, he stands midway between hope and fear, and, keeping silence, leaves judgment to the Judge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The <span class="accented">Lord</span> for <span class="accented">God</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">thy</span> for <span class="accented">thine</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">shall</span> for <span class="accented">may</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Repent</span>. The terrible words, "Thy money perish with thee," had not expressed Peter's wish for his destruction. But they were the wounds of a friend speaking sharp things to pierce, if possible, a callous conscience. In the hope that that conscience had been pierced, he now urges repentance. And yet still, dealing skilfully with so bad a case, he speaks of the forgiveness doubtfully, "if perhaps." The sin was a very grievous one; the wound must not be healed too hastily. "There is a sin unto death." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-25 The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of these coverts, in the extraordinary powers conveyed by the descent of the Spirit upon the day of Pentecost. We may take encouragement from this example, in praying to God to give the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to all for whose spiritual welfare we are concerned; for that includes all blessings. No man can give the Holy Spirit by the laying on of his hands; but we should use our best endeavours to instruct those for whom we pray. Simon Magus was ambitious to have the honour of an apostle, but cared not at all to have the spirit and disposition of a Christian. He was more desirous to gain honour to himself, than to do good to others. Peter shows him his crime. He esteemed the wealth of this world, as if it would answer for things relating to the other life, and would purchase the pardon of sin, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. This was such a condemning error as could by no means consist with a state of grace. Our hearts are what they are in the sight of God, who cannot be deceived. And if they are not right in his sight, our religion is vain, and will stand us in no stead. A proud and covetous heart cannot be right with God. It is possible for a man to continue under the power of sin, yet to put on a form of godliness. When tempted with money to do evil, see what a perishing thing money is, and scorn it. Think not that Christianity is a trade to live by in this world. There is much wickedness in the thought of the heart, its false notions, and corrupt affections, and wicked projects, which must be repented of, or we are undone. But it shall be forgiven, upon our repentance. The doubt here is of the sincerity of Simon's repentance, not of his pardon, if his repentance was sincere. Grant us, Lord, another sort of faith than that which made Simon wonder only, and did not sanctify his heart. May we abhor all thoughts of making religion serve the purposes of pride or ambition. And keep us from that subtle poison of spiritual pride, which seeks glory to itself even from humility. May we seek only the honour which cometh from God.</body></html>
