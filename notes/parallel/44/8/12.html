We may infer from the other narrative of Philip's mission-work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/8-31.htm" title="And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.">Acts 8:31-35</a>) that it also included an outline-history of the passion and death and resurrection of the Prophet whom they had seen among them as fulfilling the great Messianic prophecies.<p><span class= "bld">They were baptized, both men and women.</span>--The tense points, not to one great act, but to the continual succession of converts who were thus admitted. We think of the woman of Samaria, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-7.htm" title="There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.">John 4:7</a>, and wonder whether she was one of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- Good tidings</span> for <span class="accented">the things</span>, A.V. and T.R. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 As far as the gospel prevails, evil spirits are dislodged, particularly unclean spirits. All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe the gospel.</body></html>
