The "long time" during which the evil fascination had been exercised, reckoning backwards from the date which we have now reached (A.D. 34), might carry us to a period prior to our Lord's visit to Sychar, in A.D. 30. It is scarcely probable, however, that it was in active operation at that time. And it is likely enough that, finding the people still influenced by the impressions which that visit had left, he wrought on their excited feelings for his own purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- They gave heed to him</span> for <span class="accented">to him they had regard</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">amazed</span> for <span class="accented">bewitched</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">his sorceries</span> for <span class="accented">sorceries</span>, A.V. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 As far as the gospel prevails, evil spirits are dislodged, particularly unclean spirits. All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe the gospel.</body></html>
