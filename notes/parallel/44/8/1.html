He "kept the garments" of the witnesses who flung the stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-20.htm" title="And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.">Acts 22:20</a>). The statement came, we can scarcely doubt, from St. Paul's own lips, and in his use of the same word in the passage just referred to, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm" title="Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.">Romans 1:32</a>, we may see an indication that he had learnt to see that his guilt in so doing was greater, and not less, than that of the actual murderers.<p><span class= "bld">There was a great</span> <span class= "bld">persecution against the church.</span>--It is clear that this involved much suffering, imprisonment, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm" title="As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.">Acts 8:3</a>, perhaps the spoiling of men's goods, the being made "a gazing stock by reproaches and afflictions" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-33.htm" title="Partly, whilst you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst you became companions of them that were so used.">Hebrews 10:33-34</a>). In St. James's description of the sufferings of the brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/2-6.htm" title="But you have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?">James 2:6-7</a>), we may see at once the measure of the violence of the persecution, and the prominence in it (though Saul, the Pharisee, was for the time the chief leader) of the priesthood and the rich Sadducean aristocracy.<p><span class= "bld">Throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria.</span>--Jerusalem was naturally the chief scene of the persecution, and the neighbouring towns, Hebron, and Gaza, and Lydda, and Joppa, became places of refuge. It was probably to this influx of believers in Christ that we may trace the existence of Christian communities in the two latter cities. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-32.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelled at Lydda.">Acts 9:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-36.htm" title="Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and giving of alms which she did.">Acts 9:36</a>.) The choice of Samaria was, perhaps, suggested by the hatred of that people to the Jews. Those who were fleeing from a persecution set on foot by the priests and rulers of Jerusalem were almost <span class= "ital">ipso facto</span> sure of a welcome in Neapolis and other cities. But the choice of this as a place of refuge indicated that the barriers of the old antipathy were already in part broken down. What seemed the pressure of circumstances was leading indirectly to the fulfilment of our Lord's commands, that the disciples should be witnesses in Samaria as well as in Judaea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm" title="But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.">Acts 1:8</a>). It seems probable, as already suggested (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm" title="And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.">Acts 7:16</a>), that there was some point of contact between the Seven, of whom Stephen was the chief, and that region.<p><span class= "bld">Except the apostles.</span>--The sequel of the history suggests two reasons for their remaining. (1) The Twelve had learnt the lesson which their Master had taught them, "that the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-13.htm" title="The hireling flees, because he is an hireling, and cares not for the sheep.">John 10:13</a>), and would not desert their post. A tradition is recorded by Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom. vi.</span> 5, ? 43) and Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist. v.</span> 13), that the Lord had commanded the Apostles to remain for twelve years in Jerusalem lest any should say "We have not heard," and after that date to go forth into the world. (2) The persecution which was now raging seems to have been directed specially against those who taught with Stephen, that the "customs" on which the Pharisees laid so much stress should pass away. The Apostles had not as yet proclaimed that truth; had, perhaps, not as yet been led to it. They were conspicuous as worshippers in the Temple, kept themselves from all that was common and unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-14.htm" title="But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.">Acts 10:14</a>), held aloof from fellowship with the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>). They may well have been protected by the favour and reverence with which the great body of the people still looked on them, and so have been less exposed than the Seven had been to the violence of the storm. It was probable, in the nature of the case, that the Hellenistic disciples, who had been represented by Stephen, should suffer more than others. It was from them that the next great step in the expansion of the Church in due course came.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-4 Though persecution must not drive us from our work, yet it may send us to work elsewhere. Wherever the established believer is driven, he carries the knowledge of the gospel, and makes known the preciousness of Christ in every place. Where a simple desire of doing good influences the heart, it will be found impossible to shut a man out from all opportunities of usefulness.</body></html>
