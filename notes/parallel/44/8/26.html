It was the southernmost or border-city of the early Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-19.htm" title="And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you come to Gerar, to Gaza; as you go, to Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lasha.">Genesis 10:19</a>), and was occupied first by the Avim, and then by the Caphtorim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm" title="And the Avims which dwelled in Hazerim, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelled in their stead.)">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>).

It resisted Alexander the Great during a siege of five months, and was an important military position, the very key of the country, during the struggles between the Ptolemies and the Seleucidae, and in the wars of the Maccabees (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/11-61.htm" title="From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out; wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.">1 Maccabees 11:61</a>).

If we assume the latter, we may think of it as written after the city had been laid waste during the Jewish war (A.D. 65). On the former hypothesis, it points to a less frequented route than that from Jerusalem through Ramleh to Gaza, which led through Hebron and then through the Southern or <span class= "ital">Negeb</span> country. On the whole, the latter seems most to commend itself, and on this view we may see in it part of the instruction which Philip reported as coming, whether in dream or vision or voice we are not told, from the angel of the Lord. He was to go in faith to the less frequented, less promising route from Jerusalem to Gaza, apparently without passing himself through the Holy City, and so to intercept the traveller whose history was to become so memorable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> <span class="accented">- But an angel</span> for <span class="accented">and the angel</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the same is</span> for <span class="accented">which is</span>, A.V.

As regards the words, <span class="cmt_word">the same is desert</span>, it is observable that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-1.htm">Numbers 31:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the LXX. rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, and that part of the country is called "the wilderness of Judaea." The words of the angel, therefore, mean, not that Gaza is desert, nor that the read itself is desert, but that the country to which he was directing Philip's journey was part of that known as the desert; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> does not refer to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> or to <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span>, but to <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, understood as contained in <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The meaning of the whole sentence I take to be as follows: - "Take thy journey in [or, 'by'] the south [comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-14.htm">Luke 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-15.htm">Acts 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-1.htm">Acts 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>. lids far as [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, 'notans locum vel terminum ad quem' (Schleusner)] the road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, where the country is desert." Philip was to proceed from Samaria along the south country till he came to where the Jerusalem road met his road. That district, he is reminded, was desert, part, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, or the desert of Judaea. The spot was probably selected for that very reason, as affording the privacy necessary for the eunuch to read in his chariot, and for Philip to join him and expound the Word of God to him. Chrysostom (followed by others) takes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "at noonday in the most violent heat," though he also renders it "southwards" (Hem., 19.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:26-40 Philip was directed to go to a desert. Sometimes God opens a door of opportunity to his ministers in very unlikely places. We should study to do good to those we come into company with by travelling. We should not be so shy of all strangers as some affect to be. As to those of whom we know nothing else, we know this, that they have souls. It is wisdom for men of business to redeem time for holy duties; to fill up every minute with something which will turn to a good account. In reading the word of God, we should often pause, to inquire of whom and of what the sacred writers spake; but especially our thoughts should be employed about the Redeemer. The Ethiopian was convinced by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, of the exact fulfilment of the Scripture, was made to understand the nature of the Messiah's kingdom and salvation, and desired to be numbered among the disciples of Christ. Those who seek the truth, and employ their time in searching the Scriptures, will be sure to reap advantages. The avowal of the Ethiopian must be understood as expressing simple reliance on Christ for salvation, and unreserved devotion to Him. Let us not be satisfied till we get faith, as the Ethiopian did, by diligent study of the Holy Scriptures, and the teaching of the Spirit of God; let us not be satisfied till we get it fixed as a principle in our hearts. As soon as he was baptized, the Spirit of God took Philip from him, so that he saw him no more; but this tended to confirm his faith. When the inquirer after salvation becomes acquainted with Jesus and his gospel, he will go on his way rejoicing, and will fill up his station in society, and discharge his duties, from other motives, and in another manner than heretofore. Though baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, with water, it is not enough without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Lord, grant this to every one of us; then shall we go on our way rejoicing.</body></html>
