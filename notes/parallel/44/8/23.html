This is the only passage in the New Testament in which it is used figuratively. "Bitterness" meets us, as expressing extreme moral depravity, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-14.htm" title="Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:">Romans 3:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a>. The latter phrase implies that the iniquity of Simon bound him as with the iron chains of a habit from which he could not free himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - See for <span class="accented">perceive</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In the gall of bitterness</span>, etc. The passage from which both this expression and the similar one in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a> are taken is manifestly <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>, where the Greek of the LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>. The context there also shows conclusively that the "gall and bitterness" ("wormwood," A.V.) of which Moses speaks is the spirit of idolatry or defection from God springing up in some professing member of the Church, and defiling and corrupting others, as it is expounded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15, 16</a>. This, as St. Peter saw, was exactly the case with Simon, whose heart was not straight with God, but "had turned away from him," as it is said in Deuteronomy. Though baptized, he was still an idolater in heart, and likely to trouble many. "The gall of bitterness" is the same as "gall and wormwood," or "bitterness." "Gall," or "bile," is in classical Greek and other languages a synonym for "bitterness," especially in a figurative sense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-15.htm">Lamentations 3:15, 19</a> - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, LXX.). The uncommon phrase, the bond of iniquity, seems to be borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>, where the LXX. have the same words, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "loose the bands of wickedness," A.V. Simon was still bound in these bands. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-25 The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of these coverts, in the extraordinary powers conveyed by the descent of the Spirit upon the day of Pentecost. We may take encouragement from this example, in praying to God to give the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to all for whose spiritual welfare we are concerned; for that includes all blessings. No man can give the Holy Spirit by the laying on of his hands; but we should use our best endeavours to instruct those for whom we pray. Simon Magus was ambitious to have the honour of an apostle, but cared not at all to have the spirit and disposition of a Christian. He was more desirous to gain honour to himself, than to do good to others. Peter shows him his crime. He esteemed the wealth of this world, as if it would answer for things relating to the other life, and would purchase the pardon of sin, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. This was such a condemning error as could by no means consist with a state of grace. Our hearts are what they are in the sight of God, who cannot be deceived. And if they are not right in his sight, our religion is vain, and will stand us in no stead. A proud and covetous heart cannot be right with God. It is possible for a man to continue under the power of sin, yet to put on a form of godliness. When tempted with money to do evil, see what a perishing thing money is, and scorn it. Think not that Christianity is a trade to live by in this world. There is much wickedness in the thought of the heart, its false notions, and corrupt affections, and wicked projects, which must be repented of, or we are undone. But it shall be forgiven, upon our repentance. The doubt here is of the sincerity of Simon's repentance, not of his pardon, if his repentance was sincere. Grant us, Lord, another sort of faith than that which made Simon wonder only, and did not sanctify his heart. May we abhor all thoughts of making religion serve the purposes of pride or ambition. And keep us from that subtle poison of spiritual pride, which seeks glory to itself even from humility. May we seek only the honour which cometh from God.</body></html>
