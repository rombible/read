The strict <span class= "ital">Jew</span> would not enter a Gentile's house, nor sit on the same couch, nor eat or drink out of the same vessel. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/7-3.htm" title="For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.">Mark 7:3-4</a>.) The very dust of a heathen city was defiling. The Hindoo feeling of caste, shrinking from contact with those of a lower grade, driven to madness and mutiny by "greased cartridges," presents the nearest modern analogue.<p><span class= "bld">God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span>--The Apostle had, we find, at last learnt the lesson which the vision had taught him, in all the fulness of its meaning. Humanity as such had been redeemed by the Incarnation and Ascension, and was no longer common or unclean, even in the most outcast heathen. God was willing to receive all men. Sin alone was that which separated men from Him. Impurity was thought of as a moral, not a physical taint, and men were taught to see even in the sinner the potentialities of a higher life. He, too, had been redeemed, and might be justified and sanctified, and to him therefore honour and reverence were due as to one in whom the image of God was not utterly effaced, and might be restored to brightness. It is interesting, in this connection, to note the "Honour all men" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>. It is obvious that the pride of class, resting on mere differences of culture, and showing itself in acts and words of contempt, is, from one point of view, even less excusable than that which at least imagined that it rested on a religious basis, while from another, it is less inveterate, and therefore more easily curable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - Ye <span class="accented">yourselves</span> for <span class="accented">ye</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to join himself</span> for <span class="accented">to keep company</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and yet unto me hath God showed</span> for <span class="accented">but God hath showed me</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Ye yourselves know</span>. It was notorious among the Romans that the Jews kept themselves aloof from other people. Hence the accusation against them, in common with Christians, of being haters of the human race. Tacitus says of them that they hated all people, except their own countrymen, as their enemies, and refused to eat or intermarry with them ("Separati epulis discreti cubilibus;" 'Hist.,' 5:5). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">one of another nation</span>, occurs only here in the New Testament, but is common in the LXX. often as a synonym for "Philistines" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>, etc.). This rather refutes Meyer's remark that "the designation (of Gentiles) here is tenderly forbearing." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:19-33 When we see our call clear to any service, we should not be perplexed with doubts and scruples arising from prejudices or former ideas. Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of the heavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken as kindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to join us in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gave him to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospel ministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiring us to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called to speak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said that they are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that are commanded of God! But these were ready to hear what Peter was commanded of God to say.</body></html>
