Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.">John 13:8</a>. He had been taught that that which "goeth into the mouth cannot defile the man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-15.htm" title="There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.">Mark 7:15</a>), but he had not taken in that truth in its fulness, either in its literal or symbolic meaning.<p><span class= "bld">Any thing that is common or unclean.</span>--"Common" is used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-2.htm" title="And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they found fault.">Mark 7:2</a>, in the sense of "defiled" or "impure," that which excludes the idea of consecration to a special service.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- And unclean</span> for or <span class="accented">unclean</span>, A.V. and T.R. It is rather a striking testimony to Peter's religious character as a Jew before his call to the apostolate, that, poor Galilaean fisherman as he was, unlearned and ignorant, he had yet always conscientiously obeyed the Law of Moses in regard to things clean and unclean (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-15</a>). The address, <span class="cmt_word">Lord</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>), seems certainly to recognize the voice as that of Christ, which also agrees with the descent of the vessel from heaven. The answer is very similar to the refusals in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-8.htm">John 13:8</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:9-18 The prejudices of Peter against the Gentiles, would have prevented his going to Cornelius, unless the Lord had prepared him for this service. To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.</body></html>
