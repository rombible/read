It is obvious that it might in part be the natural consequence of the protracted fast, and the intense prayer, possibly also of exposure under such conditions to the noontide sun.

Applied to a man, it denotes that state in which the external senses and the volition are suspended, and all his impressions are derived from within (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-5.htm">Acts 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>).

To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.</body></html>
