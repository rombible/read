Moreover these six brothers accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:">Acts 11:12</a>, that they were six in number. They were obviously taken that "in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be established" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>), that they might report to the Church at Joppa what had been done by the Apostle whom they had learnt to reverence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - So he <span class="accented">called</span> for <span class="accented">then called he</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he arose and went forth</span> for Paler <span class="accented">went away</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">certain of the brethren</span> for <span class="accented">certain brethren</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">And lodged them</span> is rather a feeble rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>.

The word carries with it that he showed them hospitality, and thus broke down the wall of partition between him and them. "He gave them friendly treatment, and made them at home with him" (Chrysostom).

Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of the heavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken as kindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to join us in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gave him to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospel ministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiring us to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called to speak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said that they are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that are commanded of God! But these were ready to hear what Peter was commanded of God to say.</body></html>
