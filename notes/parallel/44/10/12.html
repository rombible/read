Stress in each case is laid upon there being "all manner" of each class, those that were allowed, and those also that were forbidden by the Jewish law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- Beasts and creeping things of the earth</span> for <span class="accented">beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">heaven</span> for <span class="accented">air</span>, A.V. The distinction between clean and unclean was very sharply drawn in the Levitical Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>; see especially vers. 41-44 and Leviticus 20:25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-3.htm">Deuteronomy 14:3-20</a>). Peter's astonishment must, therefore, have been exceeding great at the command to slay and eat. And so his answer in ver. 14 shows. And yet our Lord had taught him the same truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-10.htm">Matthew 15:10-20</a>, or still more distinctly <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-14.htm">Mark 8:14-23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:9-18 The prejudices of Peter against the Gentiles, would have prevented his going to Cornelius, unless the Lord had prepared him for this service. To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.</body></html>
