The "hunger" mentioned in the next verse implies that up to that time he had partaken of no food, and makes it probable that it was one of the days, the second and fifth in the week, which the Pharisees and other devout Jews observed as fasts. The flat housetop of an Eastern house was commonly used for prayer and meditation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm" title="What I tell you in darkness, that speak you in light: and what you hear in the ear, that preach you on the housetops.">Matthew 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-17.htm" title="Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:">Matthew 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-31.htm" title="In that day, he which shall be on the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.">Luke 17:31</a>), and in a city like Joppa, and a house like that of the tanner, was probably the only place accessible for such a purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">Now on</span> for <span class="accented">on</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">were</span> for <span class="accented">went</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The house top</span>; the quietest and most retired place in an Eastern house (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25, 26</a>). It is not inconsistent with this that the hour-top could also be made a place of special publicity, from its height and open space (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-3.htm">Luke 12:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">About the sixth hour</span>. Noon, the second of the three hours of prayer among the Jews, called "the midday prayer." The last was the ninth hour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>) and the first the third hour, nine in the morning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>).

To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.</body></html>
