His admission into the Church, even if it were not the first instance of the reception of a Gentile convert as such, became, through its supernatural accompaniments and (in the strict sense of that word) its "prerogative" character, the ruling case on the subject. Whether it were earlier or later than the admission of the Gentiles recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>, we have no adequate <span class= "ital">data</span> for determining. (See Note on that passage.)<p>Caesarea was at this time the usual residence of the Roman Procurator of Judaea, and was consequently garrisoned by Roman troops. Greeks, Jews, and Romans, probably also Ph?nicians and other traders, were mingled freely in its population.<p><span class= "bld">Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band.</span>--The office was a comparatively subordinate one, the centurion commanding the sixth part of a cohort, the sixtieth part of a legion. The Greek implies that he belonged to the cohort, not that he commanded it. The name Cornelius may indicate a connection with the great Cornelian gens which had been made famous by the Gracchi and by Sylla. The bands, or <span class= "ital">cohorts, </span>stationed at Caesarea consisted chiefly of auxiliaries levied from the province (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 13, ? 6), who were not always to be relied on in times of popular excitement, and this cohort was accordingly distinguished from the others as Italian, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as being at least commanded by Roman officers. A first Italian legion is repeatedly mentioned by Tacitus (<span class= "ital">Hist.</span> i. 59, 64; c. 100; iii. 22), but this is said by Dion (lv. 24) to have been first raised by Nero; and the term which St. Luke uses for band (<span class= "ital">spira</span>) was, strictly speaking, not used of the legions, the latter term being applied exclusively to Roman troops. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-1.htm" title="And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.">Acts 27:1</a> we meet with another of these cohorts, also at Caesarea, known as the Augustan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Now <span class="accented">there was</span> (two last words in italics) for <span class="accented">there was</span> (in roman), A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Cornelius by name</span> for <span class="accented">called Cornelius</span>, A.V. A glance at the map will show that Caesarea (see note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>) was but a short distance, some thirty miles, from Joppa. It was doubtless with a view to Peter's momentous errand to Caesarea that Luke recorded his previous visit to Lydda and his residence at Joppa, consequent upon the restoring of Dorcas to life: the <span class="accented">origines</span> of Gentile Christianity being the prime object of the Acts (see Introduction to the Acts). <span class="cmt_word">The Italian band</span>; or, <span class="accented">cohort</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, or cohort, was used in two <span class="accented">senses.</span> When spoken of strictly Roman troops, it meant the tenth part of a legion, and consisted of from four hundred and twenty-five to five hundred or six hundred men, according to the strength of the legion. Its commander was called a chiliarch, and it was divided into centuries, each commanded by a centurion. But when spoken of auxiliary provincial troops, it meant a regiment of about a thousand men (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 3:42). It is in this last sense probably that it is used here. Josephus, in the passage above quoted, speaks of five such auxiliary cohorts coming from Caesarea to join Vespasian's army, and he tells us in another place ('Bell. Jud.,' 2:18, 7) that the principal portion of the Roman army at Caesarea were Syrians. It is pretty certain, therefore, that the Italian cohort here spoken of were auxiliaries, so called as being made up in whole or in part of Italians, probably volunteers or <span class="accented">velones</span> (Farrar, vol. 1:278, note). Another reason for this conclusion is that it does not seem likely that one of the <span class="accented">divisions</span> of a legion should have a name (though it was very common for the legions themselves to be distinguished, in addition to their number, prima, secunda, decima, etc., by such names as Italics, Parthica, Augusta, etc.), but that separate regiments would naturally have appropriate names for the same reason that the legions had. Thus, besides the Italian cohort here named, we have the Augustan cohort in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>. It might be important for the security of the procurator, in so turbulent a province as Judaea, to have at least one cohort of Italian soldiers at the seat of government. Renan ('Apotres,' p. 202) thinks the full name of the cohort may have been "Cohors prima Augusta Italica civium Romanorum;" and adds that there were in the whole empire not fewer than thirty-two cohorts bearing the name of <span class="accented">Italian.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 Hitherto none had been baptized into the Christian church but Jews, Samaritans, and those converts who had been circumcised and observed the ceremonial law; but now the Gentiles were to be called to partake all the privileges of God's people, without first becoming Jews. Pure and undefiled religion is sometimes found where we least expect it. Wherever the fear of God rules in the heart, it will appear both in works of charity and of piety, neither will excuse from the other. Doubtless Cornelius had true faith in God's word, as far as he understood it, though not as yet clear faith in Christ. This was the work of the Spirit of God, through the mediation of Jesus, even before Cornelius knew him, as is the case with us all when we, who before were dead in sin, are made alive. Through Christ also his prayers and alms were accepted, which otherwise would have been rejected. Without dispute or delay Cornelius was obedient to the heavenly vision. In the affairs of our souls, let us not lose time.</body></html>
