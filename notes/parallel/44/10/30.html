Assuming that Cornelius in his fasts observed the usage of devout Jews, we may think of his vision as having been on the second day of the week, and Peter's on the fifth. It is probable, accordingly, that the meeting in the house of Cornelius took place on the Sabbath. Allowing some hours for the conference, of which we have probably but a condensed report, the outpouring of the Spirit, the subsequent baptism, and the meal which must have followed on it, may have coincided with the beginning of the first day of the week.<p><span class= "bld">In bright clothing.</span>--The phrase is the same as that used by St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-2.htm" title="And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.">Acts 2:2-3</a>). The same adjective is employed by St. John to describe the raiment of the angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm" title="And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.">Revelation 15:6</a>), and of the bride of the Lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm" title="And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.">Revelation 19:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="accented">- Until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer</span> for I <span class="accented">was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour I prayed</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">apparel</span> for <span class="accented">clothing</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Four days ago</span>. This was the fourth day (see ver. 23, note). <span class="cmt_word">Until this hour</span>, etc. The reading of the R.T. is not adopted by Meyer or Alford, and the R.V. is unintelligible. The A.V. seems to give the meaning clearly and accurately. <span class="accented">Until this hour</span> probably denotes the sixth hour, midday, as in ver. 9. Peter's journey would naturally have been taken in the cool of the early morning. Starting at 5 or 6 a.m., five hours, with perhaps an hour's halt, would bring him to the end of his fifteen miles' journey by 11 or 12 a.m. <span class="cmt_word">Apparel</span>.

Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of the heavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken as kindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to join us in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gave him to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospel ministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiring us to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called to speak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said that they are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that are commanded of God! But these were ready to hear what Peter was commanded of God to say.</body></html>
