That had purified them from whatever taint had adhered to them under the precepts of the Law. In the interpretation of the vision, all that belongs to humanity had been taken up into heaven; first, when man's nature was assumed by the Eternal Word in the Incarnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), and, secondly, when that nature had been raised in the Ascension to the heaven of heavens, sitting on the right hand of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a><span class= "ital">;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-19.htm" title="So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.">Mark 16:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - A voice for <span class="accented">the voice</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">came</span> for <span class="accented">spake</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">make not</span> for <span class="accented">that call not</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">What God hath cleansed</span>, etc. "The Law was our schoolmaster ['tutor,' R.V.] to bring us to Christ."

To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.</body></html>
