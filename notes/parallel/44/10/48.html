Who administered it in this instance we are not told. Possibly there may have been an <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> already organised at Caesarea, as the result of Philip's work, and its elders or deacons, or Philip himself, may have acted under Peter's orders. If those who came with him from Joppa had so acted, it would probably we may believe, have been stated.<p><span class= "bld">Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</span>--The days so spent must have included at least one "first day of the week," and both in the solemn breaking of bread, and in the social intercourse of the other days, Peter must have mingled freely with the new converts, eating and drinking with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-2.htm" title="And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,">Acts 11:2</a>), without any fear of being thereby defiled. That visit to Caesarea, St. Luke dwells on as one of the great turning-points in the Apostle's life, attesting his essential agreement with St. Paul. We can well understand how he shrank from marring the effect of that attestation by recording the melancholy inconsistency of his subsequent conduct at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11-12</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span> for <span class="accented">the Lord</span>, A.V. and T.R.

They prayed him to tarry with them, no doubt that they might receive fuller instruction in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, into which they had been baptized. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:44-48 The Holy Ghost fell upon others after they were baptized, to confirm them in the faith; but upon these Gentiles before they were baptized, to show that God does not confine himself to outward signs. The Holy Ghost fell upon those who were neither circumcised nor baptized; it is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing. They magnified God, and spake of Christ and the benefits of redemption. Whatever gift we are endued with, we ought to honour God with it. The believing Jews who were present, were astonished that the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the Gentiles also. By mistaken notions of things, we make difficult for ourselves as to the methods of Divine providence and grace. As they were undeniably baptized with the Holy Ghost, Peter concluded they were not to be refused the baptism of water, and the ordinance was administered. The argument is conclusive; can we deny the sign to those who have received the things signified? Those who have some acquaintance with Christ, cannot but desire more. Even those who have received the Holy Ghost, must see their need of daily learning more of the truth.</body></html>
