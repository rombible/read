It is interesting to note that St. Peter and St. Paul agree in thus connecting the Resurrection with the assurance that He who had risen was to be the future Judge of all men. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Which was ordained.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">which has been ordained.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> <span class="accented">- Charged</span> for <span class="accented">commanded</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">this is he which is</span> for <span class="accented">it is he which was</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To be the Judge</span>, etc. This statement involves the resurrection of the dead (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11, 12</a>). It is easy to see how the creeds would be formed from the repetition of short doctrinal statements like this (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3, 4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:34-43 Acceptance cannot be obtained on any other ground than that of the covenant of mercy, through the atonement of Christ; but wherever true religion is found, God will accept it without regarding names or sects. The fear of God and works of righteousness are the substance of true religion, the effects of special grace. Though these are not the cause of a man's acceptance, yet they show it; and whatever may be wanting in knowledge or faith, will in due time be given by Him who has begun it. They knew in general the word, that is, the gospel, which God sent to the children of Israel. The purport of this word was, that God by it published the good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ. They knew the several matters of fact relating to the gospel. They knew the baptism of repentance which John preached. Let them know that this Jesus Christ, by whom peace is made between God and man, is Lord of all; not only as over all, God blessed for evermore, but as Mediator. All power, both in heaven and in earth, is put into his hand, and all judgment committed to him. God will go with those whom he anoints; he will be with those to whom he has given his Spirit. Peter then declares Christ's resurrection from the dead, and the proofs of it. Faith has reference to a testimony, and the Christian faith is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, on the testimony given by them. See what must be believed concerning him. That we are all accountable to Christ as our Judge; so every one must seek his favour, and to have him as our Friend. And if we believe in him, we shall all be justified by him as our Righteousness. The remission of sins lays a foundation for all other favours and blessings, by taking that out of the way which hinders the bestowing of them. If sin be pardoned, all is well, and shall end well for ever.</body></html>
