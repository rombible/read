Those who came with Peter were apparently not sharers at the time in the exultant joy which they were yet compelled to recognise as the Spirit's work. They listened with amazement as they heard the rapturous chant burst from the lips of the as yet unbaptised heathens. Here, accordingly, was one definite fulfilment of Peter's vision. Those who so spake had been, as it were, carried up into heaven, as the four-footed beasts and creeping things had been, and so a proof was given that no man might henceforth call them common or unclean. Peter himself had indeed learnt that lesson so fully (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>) as not to need this special attestation, but for those who came with him this evidence was needed and was sufficient.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> <span class="accented">- Amazed</span> for <span class="accented">astonished</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They of the circumcision</span> would doubtless be the brethren from Joppa who accompanied Peter (ver. 23). A more striking confirmation of Peter's vision cannot be conceived than this descent of the Holy Ghost upon the uncircumcised. How could they any longer be reckoned common or unclean whom God thus cleansed with his Holy Spirit? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:44-48 The Holy Ghost fell upon others after they were baptized, to confirm them in the faith; but upon these Gentiles before they were baptized, to show that God does not confine himself to outward signs. The Holy Ghost fell upon those who were neither circumcised nor baptized; it is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing. They magnified God, and spake of Christ and the benefits of redemption. Whatever gift we are endued with, we ought to honour God with it. The believing Jews who were present, were astonished that the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the Gentiles also. By mistaken notions of things, we make difficult for ourselves as to the methods of Divine providence and grace. As they were undeniably baptized with the Holy Ghost, Peter concluded they were not to be refused the baptism of water, and the ordinance was administered. The argument is conclusive; can we deny the sign to those who have received the things signified? Those who have some acquaintance with Christ, cannot but desire more.
