They brought a good report of their faith and love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1Thessalonians 3:6</a>), possibly also fresh proofs of their personal regard, and that of the Philippians, in the form of gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>). This may, however, refer to a later occasion. The First Epistle to the Thessalonians was probably sent back by the brethren who had accompanied Silas and Timotheus on their journey to Corinth. The reader will note the parallelism (1) between the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>, which treats of the Second Advent, with the teaching of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-52</a>, and (2) between the few words as to spiritual gifts, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" title="Quench not the Spirit.">1Thessalonians 5:19-21</a>, with the fuller treatment of the same subject in 1 Corinthians 12-14.<p><span class= "bld">Paul was pressed in the spirit.</span>--The better MSS. give, "he was constrained <span class= "ital">by the Word."</span> The words describe something of the same strong emotion as the "paroxysm" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-16.htm" title="Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.">Acts 17:16</a>. The Word was within him as a constraining power, compelling him to give utterance to it. His "heart was hot within him, and while he was musing the fire kindled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-4.htm" title="LORD, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.">Psalm 39:4</a>). Whether there was any connection between the arrival of Silas and Timotheus and this strong feeling is a question which there are no sufficient <span class= "ital">data</span> for answering. It is hardly satisfactory to say, as has been suggested, that they probably brought pecuniary supplies from Macedonia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>), and that he was therefore relieved from the obligation of working for his livelihood, and able to give himself more entirely to the work of preaching. There is no indication of his giving up tent-making, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1</a> is decidedly against it. A more probable explanation may be found in the strong desire--of which he says, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>, that he had cherished it for many years--to see Rome and preach the gospel there. Now he found himself brought into contact with those who had come from Rome, who formed, in fact, part of its population, and the old feeling was stirred to a new intensity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Timothy</span> for <span class="accented">Timotheus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">came down</span> for <span class="accented">were come down</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">constrained by the Word</span> for <span class="accented">pressed in spirit</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">testifying</span> for <span class="accented">and testified</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Christ</span> for <span class="accented">Christ</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When Silas and Timothy</span>, etc. It is probable that Silas had returned by St. Paul's directions to Beraea, and Timothy to Thessalonica from Athens. If there were extant a letter of Paul to the Beraeans, it would probably mention his sending back Silas to them, just as the Epistle to the Thessalonians mentions his sending Timothy to them. Now they both come to Corinth from <span class="accented">Macedonia</span>, which includes Beraea and Thessalonica. If they came by sea, they would probably sail together from Dium to Cenchreae (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Was constrained by the Word</span>. As an English phrase, this is almost destitute of meaning. If the R.T. is right, and it has very strong manuscript authority, the words <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> mean that he was seized, taken possession of, and as it were bound by the necessity of preaching the Word, constrained as it were to preach more earnestly than ever. In St. Luke <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is a medical term: in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-28.htm">Luke 4:28</a>, R.T., "Holden with a great fever;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-37.htm">Luke 8:37</a>, "Holden with a great fear;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8</a>, "Sick of fever and dysentery;" and so frequently in medical writers ('Medical Language of St. <span class="accented">Luke</span>,' Hobart). But it is worth considering whether <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> is not in the middle voice, with the sense belonging to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "continuous," "unbroken," and so that the phrase means that, after the arrival of Silas and Timothy, St. Paul gave himself up to continuous preaching. St. Luke has not infrequently a use of words peculiar to himself. The Vulgate rendering, <span class="accented">instabat verbo</span>, seems so to understand it. It was probably soon after the arrival of Silas and Timothy that St. Paul wrote his First Epistle to the Thessalonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2, 6</a>). The Second Epistle followed some time before St. Paul left Corinth. If the T.R., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, is right, it must be construed, "constrained by the Spirit," in accordance with <span class="accented">Greek</span> usage. <span class="cmt_word">Testifying</span>, etc. Note how different St. Paul's preaching in the synagogue was from his preaching in the Areopagus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Though Paul was entitled to support from the churches he planted, and from the people to whom he preached, yet he worked at his calling. An honest trade, by which a man may get his bread, is not to be looked upon with contempt by any. It was the custom of the Jews to bring up their children to some trade, though they gave them learning or estates. Paul was careful to prevent prejudices, even the most unreasonable. The love of Christ is the best bond of the saints; and the communings of the saints with each other, sweeten labour, contempt, and even persecution. Most of the Jews persisted in contradicting the gospel of Christ, and blasphemed. They would not believe themselves, and did all they could to keep others from believing. Paul hereupon left them. He did not give over his work; for though Israel be not gathered, Christ and his gospel shall be glorious. The Jews could not complain, for they had the first offer. When some oppose the gospel, we must turn to others. Grief that many persist in unbelief should not prevent gratitude for the conversion of some to Christ.</body></html>
