The process was, perhaps, somewhat different, as the line of argument in the Epistle to the Hebrews differs from that in the Epistle to the Galatians. To lead men on, after the manner of Philo, into the deeper meanings that lay beneath the letter of Scripture, to deal with them as those who were pressing forwards to the perfection of maturity in spiritual growth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-11.htm" title="Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.">Hebrews 5:11-14</a>), instead of treating them as children who must be fed with milk and not with "strong meat" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>solid food), as St. Paul had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1Corinthians 1:2</a>)--it was natural that this should attract followers to the new preacher, and give him a larger measure of real or apparent success in dealing with the Jews than had attended the labours of St. Paul. As Apollos does not appear again in the Acts, it may be well to bring together what is known as to his after-history. At Corinth, as has been said, his name was used as the watchword of a party, probably that of the philosophising Jews and proselytes, as distinguished from the narrower party of the circumcision that rallied round the name of Cephas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>). Not a word escapes from St. Paul that indicates any doctrinal difference between himself and Apollos, and as the latter had been instructed by St. Paul's friends, Aquila and Priscilla, this was, indeed, hardly probable. It would appear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1Corinthians 16:12</a>, that he returned to Ephesus, probably with letters of commendation from the Church of Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>). St. Paul's confidence in him is shown by his desire that he should return once more to Corinth with Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus. His own reluctance to be the occasion even of the semblance of schism explains his unwillingness to go (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1Corinthians 16:12</a>). After this we lose sight of him for some years. These, we may well believe, were well filled up by evangelising labours after the pattern of those which we have seen at Ephesus and Corinth. Towards the close of St. Paul's ministry (A. D. 65) we get our last glimpse of him, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm" title="Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to them.">Titus 3:13</a>. He is in company with Zenas, the lawyer (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-35.htm" title="Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,">Matthew 22:35</a>), one, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, who, like himself, had a special reputation for the profounder knowledge of the Law of Moses. St. Paul's feeling towards him is still, as of old, one of affectionate interest, and he desires that Titus will help him in all things. He has been labouring at Crete, and there also has gathered round him a distinct company of disciples, whom St. Paul distinguishes from his own; "Let <span class= "ital">our's</span> also learn to maintain good works" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-14.htm" title="And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.">Titus 3:14</a>). After this, probably after St. Paul's death, he wrote--if we accept Luther's conjecture--the Epistle to the Hebrews, addressed, as some have thought, to the Jewish Christians of Palestine, and specially of Caesarea, but, more probably, as I have been led to believe, to the Christian ascetics, known as Therapeutae, trained, like himself, in the school of Philo, with whom he had formerly been associated at Alexandria. The mention of disciples of, or from, Italy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-24.htm" title="Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.">Hebrews 13:24</a> suggests a connection with some other Italian Christians than those of Rome, probably with those of Puteoli. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-14.htm" title="Where we found brothers, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.">Acts 28:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> <span class="accented">- Powerfully confuted</span> for <span class="accented">mightily convinced</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Christ</span> for <span class="accented">Christ</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Powerfully confuted</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, one of St. Luke's peculiar compounds, found nowhere else; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-10.htm">Luke 23:10</a> (vehemently), but nowhere else in the New Testament.

It is remarkable that the success of Apollos at Corinth seems to have been chiefly among the Jews, who had opposed themselves so vehemently to St. Paul (ver. 6). It is one of the many proofs of the singleness of eye and simplicity of purpose of the great apostle, that the success of this novice where he himself had failed did not excite the least jealousy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>). St. Luke, too, Paul's friend and biographer, here speaks of the powers and work of Apollos with no stinted measure of praise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:24-28 Apollos taught in the gospel of Christ, as far as John's ministry would carry him, and no further. We cannot but think he had heard of Christ's death and resurrection, but he was not informed as to the mystery of them. Though he had not the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, as the apostles, he made use of the gifts he had. The dispensation of the Spirit, whatever the measure of it may be, is given to every man to profit withal. He was a lively, affectionate preacher; fervent in spirit. He was full of zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of precious souls. Here was a complete man of God, thoroughly furnished for his work. Aquila and Priscilla encouraged his ministry, by attendance upon it. They did not despise Apollos themselves, or undervalue him to others; but considered the disadvantages he had laboured under. And having themselves got knowledge in the truths of the gospel by their long intercourse with Paul, they told what they knew to him. Young scholars may gain a great deal by converse with old Christians. Those who do believe through grace, yet still need help. As long as they are in this world, there are remainders of unbelief, and something lacking in their faith to be perfected, and the work of faith to be fulfilled. If the Jews were convinced that Jesus is Christ, even their own law would teach them to hear him. The business of ministers is to preach Christ. Not only to preach the truth, but to prove and defend it, with meekness, yet with power.</body></html>
