Taking the better reading, and assuming the natural construction of the sentence to be "all of them (sc., the Jews) took Sosthenes and beat him," we have to ask for an explanation of conduct which seems so strange. This is probably found in the appearance of the same name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,">1Corinthians 1:1</a>, as associated with St. Paul in the Epistle to the Church of Corinth. It is a natural inference that Sosthenes, like his predecessor or partner in office (it does not necessarily follow that he succeeded him) became a convert to the new faith. If so, it is probable that he was already suspected of tendencies in that direction, and when the Jews at Corinth found their plans frustrated, it was natural that they should impute their failure to the lukewarmness or treachery of the man who ought to have carried them to a successful issue. They did not shrink from giving vent to their rage even before the tribunal of the proconsul.<p><span class= "bld">And Gallio cared for none of those things.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">And Gallio cared nothing for these things.</span> The words have become almost proverbial for the indifference of mere politicians and men of the world to religious truth. We speak of one who is tolerant because he is sceptical, as a Gallio. It may be questioned, however, whether this was the thought prominent in St. Luke's mind as he thus wrote. What he apparently meant was that the proconsul was clear sighted enough to pay no regard to the clamours of St. Paul's accusers. If they chose, after failing in their attack on Paul, to quarrel among themselves, what was that to him? "<span class= "ital">Laissez faire, laissez alter</span>" might well be his motto in dealing with such a people. The general impression, however, as to his character is not without its truth. The easy-going gentleness of his character ill fitted him to resist the temptations of Nero's court, and after retiring from Achaia in consequence of an attack of fever (Sen. <span class= "ital">Ep.</span> 104), he returned to Rome, and, to the distress of Burrhus and his own brother, Seneca, he took part in ministering to the emperor's vices (Dio. lxi. 20). He finally fell under the tyrant's displeasure, and, according to one tradition, was put to death by him. Another represents him as anticipating his fate by suicide; Tacitus, however (<span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xv. 73), only speaks of him as terrified by his brother's death, and supplicating Nero for his own life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- And they all laid hold on</span> for then <span class="accented">all the Greeks took</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">ruler</span> for <span class="accented">chief ruler</span>, A.V., as ver. 8. The R.T. has far more manuscript support than either the T.R. or another reading, which has "Jews" instead of "Greeks." All means all the crowd of bystanders and lookers-on, mostly, no doubt, Greeks. The Jews, always unpopular, would be sure to have the Corinthian rabble against them as soon as the proconsul drove them from the judgment seat. <span class="cmt_word">Sosthenes</span>. There is no probability whatever that he is the same person as the <span class="accented">Sosthenes</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>. The name was very common. He appears to have succeeded Crispus as ruler of the synagogue, and would be likely, therefore, to be especially hostile to Paul. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:12-17 Paul was about to show that he did not teach men to worship God contrary to law; but the judge would not allow the Jews to complain to him of what was not within his office. It was right in Gallio that he left the Jews to themselves in matters relating to their religion, but yet would not let them, under pretence of that, persecute another. But it was wrong to speak slightly of a law and religion which he might have known to be of God, and which he ought to have acquainted himself with. In what way God is to be worshipped, whether Jesus be the Messiah, and whether the gospel be a Divine revelation, are not questions of words and names, they are questions of vast importance. Gallio spoke as if he boasted of his ignorance of the Scriptures, as if the law of God was beneath his notice. Gallio cared for none of these things. If he cared not for the affronts of bad men, it was commendable; but if he concerned not himself for the abuses done to good men, his indifference was carried too far. And those who see and hear of the sufferings of God's people, and have no feeling with them, or care for them, who do not pity and pray for them, are of the same spirit as Gallio, who cared for none of these things.</body></html>
