But it is used by Demosthenes and Plutarch in exactly the same connection: <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Demosthenes, 1373,12; Plutarch, ' Marcell.,' p. 410, in Schleusner).

The <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (here and ver. 12) was properly the "raised space," or "tribune," on which, in the case of a consul, proconsul, or praetor, the <span class="accented">sella curulis</span> was placed on which he sat and gave judgment. It was usually a kind of apse to the basilica. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-13.htm">John 19:13</a>, and, indeed, here and elsewhere, it seems to be used, generally, for the judgment-seat itself (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-10.htm">Acts 25:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:12-17 Paul was about to show that he did not teach men to worship God contrary to law; but the judge would not allow the Jews to complain to him of what was not within his office. It was right in Gallio that he left the Jews to themselves in matters relating to their religion, but yet would not let them, under pretence of that, persecute another. But it was wrong to speak slightly of a law and religion which he might have known to be of God, and which he ought to have acquainted himself with. In what way God is to be worshipped, whether Jesus be the Messiah, and whether the gospel be a Divine revelation, are not questions of words and names, they are questions of vast importance. Gallio spoke as if he boasted of his ignorance of the Scriptures, as if the law of God was beneath his notice. Gallio cared for none of these things. If he cared not for the affronts of bad men, it was commendable; but if he concerned not himself for the abuses done to good men, his indifference was carried too far. And those who see and hear of the sufferings of God's people, and have no feeling with them, or care for them, who do not pity and pray for them, are of the same spirit as Gallio, who cared for none of these things.</body></html>
