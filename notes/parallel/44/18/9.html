He had seen the Lord at his conversion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4-6</a>), he had heard the same voice and seen the same form in his trance in the Temple at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>). Now he saw and heard them once more. "In visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men," he passed from the strife of tongues into the presence of the Divine Friend. The words "Be not afraid" imply that he too was subject to fear and depression, and felt keenly the trial of seeming failure and comparative isolation. His converts came chiefly from the slave or freed-man class, and those of a culture like his own, whether Greeks or Jews, were slow to accept his preaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-26.htm" title="For you see your calling, brothers, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:">1Corinthians 1:26-27</a>). And then, too, he carried, as it were, his life in his hands. The reviling of the Jews might any hour burst into furious violence or deliberate plots of assassination. No wonder that he needed the gracious words, "Be not afraid." The temptation of such a moment of human weakness was to fall back, when words seem fruitless, into the safety of silence, and therefore the command followed, "Speak, and hold not thy peace." We are reminded of the like passing mood of discouragement in one great crisis of Elijah's life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/19-4.htm" title="But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.">1Kings 19:4-14</a>), yet more, perhaps, of its frequent recurrence in Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/1-6.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.">Jeremiah 1:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/15-15.htm" title="O LORD, you know: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in your long-suffering: know that for your sake I have suffered rebuke.">Jeremiah 15:15-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- And the Lord said unto</span> for <span class="accented">then spake the Lord to</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A vision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a thing seen</span>, but always used of a wonderful "sight:" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-9.htm">Matthew 17:9</a> of the Transfiguration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-31.htm">Acts 7:31</a> of the burning bush.

So in the LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-2.htm">Genesis 46:2</a>, etc.). St. Paul received a similar gracious token of the Lord's watchful care of him soon after his conversion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17-21</a>). He tells us that then he was in an "ecstasy," or trance.
