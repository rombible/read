Nowhere, among the churches that he founded, does St. Paul seem to have found so great a receptivity for spiritual truth. While he looked on the Corinthians as being children requiring to be fed with milk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1Corinthians 3:2</a>), he saw in the Ephesians those to whom he did not shun to declare "the whole counsel of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>), to whom he could, at a later date, appeal as able to measure his knowledge of the mystery of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm" title="Whereby, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)">Ephesians 3:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - And <span class="accented">when they asked</span> for <span class="accented">when they desired</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">abide a</span> for <span class="accented">tarry</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">time</span> for <span class="accented">time with them</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">He consented not</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, only here in the New Testament, but found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-20.htm">Proverbs 26:20</a>; 2 Macc. 4:10, etc., and frequently in medical writers; literally, <span class="accented">to bend the head forward</span> by the proper muscles (Hobart). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 While Paul found he laboured not in vain, he continued labouring. Our times are in God's hand; we purpose, but he disposes; therefore we must make all promises with submission to the will of God; not only if providence permits, but if God does not otherwise direct our motions. A very good refreshment it is to a faithful minister, to have for awhile the society of his brethren. Disciples are compassed about with infirmity; ministers must do what they can to strengthen them, by directing them to Christ, who is their Strength. Let us earnestly seek, in our several places, to promote the cause of Christ, forming plans that appear to us most proper, but relying on the Lord to bring them to pass if he sees good.</body></html>
