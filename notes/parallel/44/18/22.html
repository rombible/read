In the absence of any <span class= "ital">data</span> in the Acts for settling the question, we may possibly refer to some casualty in this voyage, one of the three shipwrecks of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2Corinthians 11:25</a>. At Caesarea, we may believe, he would probably renew his intercourse with Philip the Evangelist. At Jerusalem there would be the usual gathering of the Church, the completion of his Nazarite vow in the Temple, a friendly welcome on the part of St. James and the elders of the Church. Peter was probably at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11</a>), or possibly at Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>). To this visit to Antioch we may probably refer the scene which St. Paul narrates in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11-14</a>. His long absence from Antioch had left the Judaising party time to gather strength and organise a new attack on the freedom of the Gentiles, and they brought a fresh pressure to bear upon the element of instability which still lingered in St. Peter's character, and he had not been able to resist it. It is, however, possible that the incident may have occurred before Paul and Silas had left Antioch. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/15-39.htm" title="And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;">Acts 15:39-40</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - He <span class="accented">went up</span> for <span class="accented">and gone up</span>, A. g.; <span class="accented">and went</span> for he <span class="accented">went</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When he had landed at Caesarea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. Caesarea</span> Stratonis, or Sebaste, or <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as it was variously called, to distinguish it from Caesarea Philippi (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a>, etc., and frequently elsewhere in the Acts). "Caesarea, whither probably the vessel was bound, was the military capital of the Roman province of Judea, of which Felix was at this time procurator. It was also the harbor by which all travelers from the West approached it, and from whence roads led to Egypt on the south, to Tyre and Sidon and Antioch on the north, and eastward to Nablous and Jerusalem and the Jordan" (Howson, 1:455). <span class="cmt_word">He went up and saluted the Church</span>; meaning, without any doubt, he went up to Jerusalem, as both the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>, and the object of his-going up, "to salute the Church," conclusively show.

No doubt he was received officially by the apostles, represented by James and the elders and the Church, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-4.htm">Acts 15:4</a>; and gave a formal account of the result of his second missionary journey, and of the great event of the introduction of the gospel into Macedonia and Achaia. It is a remarkable example of St. Luke's great brevity at times that this is the only notice of his arrival at Jerusalem, where his vow was to be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">Went down to Antioch</span>; from whence he had started with Silas, after his separation from Barnabas, some three years before, "being recommended by the brethren to the grace of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-40.htm">Acts 16:40</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-26.htm">Acts 14:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-30.htm">Acts 15:30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 While Paul found he laboured not in vain, he continued labouring. Our times are in God's hand; we purpose, but he disposes; therefore we must make all promises with submission to the will of God; not only if providence permits, but if God does not otherwise direct our motions. A very good refreshment it is to a faithful minister, to have for awhile the society of his brethren. Disciples are compassed about with infirmity; ministers must do what they can to strengthen them, by directing them to Christ, who is their Strength. Let us earnestly seek, in our several places, to promote the cause of Christ, forming plans that appear to us most proper, but relying on the Lord to bring them to pass if he sees good.</body></html>
