Strictly speaking, the Greek form is <span class= "ital">Ahylas, </span>but this is undoubtedly the transliterated form of the Latin <span class= "ital">Aquila</span> (= Eagle). The name appears in a yet more altered form in <span class= "ital">Onkelos, </span>the traditional writer of one of the Targums, or Paraphrases of the Law, then current among the Jews. In Aquila, one of the later translators of the Old Testament into Greek, himself also born in Pontus, and possibly (but see Mr. Deutsch's <span class= "ital">Remains, </span>p. 339) identical with Onkelos, we get the Greek form again. In the well-known chief Rabbi of the synagogues of the Jews of London, Dr. Adler, we have it reappearing in a German form (<span class= "ital">Adler=</span>Eagle). The tendency of Jews to take names derived from animals when sojourning in heathen countries, may be noted as not uncommon. Ursulus, Leo, Leopardus, Dorcas, which appear in the early Christian inscriptions in the Vatican and Lateran Museums, present analogous instances. His birth in Pontus indicates that he belonged to the dispersion of the Jews of that province (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>) which, as the north-eastern region of Asia Minor, lay between Bithynia and Armenia. Some from that province had been present at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-9.htm" title="Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,">Acts 2:9</a>). As the Jews at Rome consisted largely of freed-men, the <span class= "ital">libertinum genus</span> of Latin writers (see Note on the <span class= "ital">Libertines</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm" title="Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.">Acts 6:9</a>), it is probable that Aquila belonged to that class.<p><span class= "bld">With his wife Priscilla.</span>--The name appears in some MSS., both here and elsewhere, in the form of Prisca, of which it is the diminutive. So we have Lucilla from Lucia, Domitilla from Domitia, Atticilla (in an inscription in the Museum of Perugia) from Attica. The name Prisca probably indicates a connection with the <span class= "ital">gens</span> of the <span class= "ital">Prisci, </span>who appear in the earliest stages of Roman history, and supplied a long series of praetors and consuls. The marriage was probably, therefore, an example of the influence gained by educated Jews over the higher class of women at Rome. It was, perhaps, a natural consequence of her higher social position that her name is sometimes placed before Aquila's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-19.htm" title="Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.">2Timothy 4:19</a>). The fact that she took part in the instruction of Apollos (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>), indicates that she was a woman of more than ordinary culture, a student and interpreter of the Old Testament Scriptures.<p>The question naturally suggests itself, whether the husband and wife, who were afterwards so prominent in the Apostolic Church, were, at this stage of their career, converted by St. Paul to the faith in Christ. The answer to that question must, it is believed, be a distinct and decisive negative. (1) There is no mention of their listening to St. Paul, and believing, as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the case of Lydia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm" title="And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the things which were spoken of Paul.">Acts 16:14</a>); and it is hardly conceivable that St. Luke, who relates that case so fully, would have omitted a fact of such importance. (2) He joins himself to them, as able to share his thoughts and hopes, even before he begins preaching in the synagogue, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-4.htm" title="And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.">Acts 18:4</a>. (3) An unbelieving Jew was not likely to have admitted St. Paul into a partnership in his business. The question how and by whom the Church of Christ had been first brought to Rome will be discussed in the next Note.<p><span class= "bld">Because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome.</span>--The account of the expulsion is given by Suetonius (<span class= "ital">Claudius, </span>c. 25) in words which are in many ways suggestive--<span class= "ital">"Claudius, Jud?os, impulsore Chresto, assidue tumultuantes, Roma expulit</span>" ("Claudius expelled the Jews from Rome on account of their continual tumults, instigated by Chrestus"). The Jews, at this period, were settled mainly in the Transtiberine region of Rome, at the base of the Janiculum, opposite the present <span class= "ital">Ghetto, </span>or Jewry, of the city. They exercised considerable influence over the upper classes, had synagogues and oratories (<span class= "ital">proseuchae, </span>see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-13.htm" title="And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither.">Acts 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12</a>) of their own, were tolerated as possessing a <span class= "ital">relligio licita, </span>had their own cemeteries on the Appian Way. Suddenly there is a change in their relations to the civil power, and the name of Chrestus is connected with it. Of the man whom he so mentions, Suetonius tells us nothing further. But we know that the sounds of the Greek "i" and "?" were hardly distinguishable. Tertullian (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> c. 3) says that the name of <span class= "ital">Christus</span> was almost invariably pronounced <span class= "ital">Chr?stus, </span>and, as that word signifies "good," "useful," "honest," founds a kind of <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem</span> on the prevalent mistake. So in Jewish inscriptions in the Lateran Museum, <span class= "ital">Alfius</span> appears as the equivalent for the Greek form <span class= "ital">Alphaeus.</span> The probable explanation of Claudius's decree, accordingly, is that men had come to Rome after the Day of Pentecost proclaiming Jesus as the Christ, that this had been followed by tumults like those of which we read in the Pisidian Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.">Acts 13:50</a>), and Lystra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm" title="And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.">Acts 14:19</a>), and Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>), and Ber?a (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-13.htm" title="But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.">Acts 17:13</a>), and that as the name of Christus was much in the mouths both of those who received and those who rejected His claim to be the Messiah, the Roman magistrates, like Gallio, careless as to questions about names and words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-15.htm" title="But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look you to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.">Acts 18:15</a>), naturally inferred that he was the leader of one of the parties, probably assuming, as at Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm" title="Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.">Acts 17:7</a>), that he claimed the title of king after the manner of the pretenders to an earthly throne. If we ask who were the first preachers of the new faith, the answer, though we may be unable to identify individuals, is not far to seek. (1) It was scarcely likely that twenty-three years should have passed since the Day of Pentecost, without bringing to the ears of the Jews of Rome some tidings of what was going on in Palestine. (2) In the list of those who were present at the Pentecostal wonder are strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-10.htm" title="Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,">Acts 2:10</a>). (3) Among the Hellenistic Jews who disputed with Stephen were <span class= "ital">libertini, </span>or freed-men of Rome, and Stephen himself, we saw reason to believe, belonged to the same class. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm" title="Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.">Acts 6:9</a>.) (4) Andronicus and Junias (contracted from Junianus, as Lucas from Lucanus), who are among those to whom St. Paul sends messages of affection at Rome, were "in Christ" before him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>). To these, then, and not to St. Peter, we may probably look as among the real founders of the Church of Rome. The facts all indicate that the theology of the disciples of Rome was likely to be based upon the same great principles as that of Stephen, and this explains the readiness with which Aquila and Priscilla received the gospel as St. Paul preached it. It is obvious that many more of those who had been expelled from Rome were likely to have accompanied them from Rome to Corinth, and the long list of names in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3-15</a> probably consists for the most part of those who had thus come within the range of St. Paul's personal acquaintance, and had returned to Rome in the interval. The names in that list are many of them identical with those in the <span class= "ital">Columbaria, </span>or burial-place, on the Appian Way, which contains the names of the men and women of the freed-man class who belonged to the household of the Empress Livia, and make it almost certain that they were of the same class; and that when St. Paul speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-22.htm" title="All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.">Philippians 4:22</a>) of the "saints of Caesar's household" he is referring to such as these, and not to persons of high official rank. (See Notes on Romans 16) The name of Priscus occurs, it may be added, in a Christian inscription of uncertain date in the Collegio Romano. We need not wonder that Greek should be the medium of intercourse even with these Roman Jews. The inscriptions in the recently discovered Jewish cemetery in the <span class= "ital">Vigna Randanini, </span>at Rome, show a strange blending of the two languages, Greek words appearing sometimes in Latin characters, and Latin words in Greek. Hebrew does not appear, but the symbol of the seven-branched candlestick of the Temple recurs frequently.<p>(2) We cannot exclude from the probable motives the strong feeling of thankfulness for deliverance from danger, following upon fear which, as in nearly all phases of the religious life, has been the chief impulse out of which vows have grown. We have seen the fear, and the promise, and the deliverance, in the record of St. Paul's work at Corinth, and the vow of self-consecration, for a season, to a life of special devotion was the natural result. St. Paul had not learnt to despise or condemn such expressions of devout feeling.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- He found</span> for <span class="accented">found</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of Pontus by race</span> for <span class="accented">born in Pontus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">because</span> for <span class="accented">because that</span>, A.V.; the <span class="accented">Jews</span> for <span class="accented"></span>,[<span class="accented">ewe</span>, A.V.: he came for came, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Aquila</span>.

Whether the Jewish family residing in Pontus took the name of Aquila from any of these Romans is not known. Aquila, the translator of the Old Testament into Greek about A.D. , was also a Jew of Pontus, the old kingdom of Mithridates. That there was a considerable colony of Jews in Pontus appears also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Priscilla</span>. Also called <span class="accented">Prison</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>). So in classical authors, <span class="accented">Livia</span> and <span class="accented">Livilla, Drusa</span> and <span class="accented">Drusilla</span>, are used of the same persons (Howson, p. 415). Prisca is a not uncommon name for Roman women. The masculine Priscus occurs very frequently. Aquila and Priscilla were among the most active Christians, and the most devoted friends of St. Paul (vers. 18, 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>); and were evidently persons of culture as well as piety. Lately; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">i.q.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Pindar, etc.), only found here in the New Testament. But it occurs in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>, and in the apocryphal books repeatedly, and in Polybius. The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which is also used by the LXX. and the Apocrypha and in classical Greek for "new," is used only once in the New Testament, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>. It means properly "newly killed," hence anything "recent," "fresh, or "new." Both the adjective and the adverb are very common in medical writings. <span class="cmt_word">Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome</span>. Suetonius mentions the fact, but unfortunately does not say in what year of Claudius's reign it took place. His account is that, in consequence of frequent disturbances and riots among the Jews at the instigation of Chrestus, Claudius drove them from Rome. It seems almost certain, as Renan says, especially combining Tacitus's account ('Annal.,' 15:44) of the spread of Christianity in the city of Rome before the time of Nero, that <span class="accented">Chrestus</span> (Greek <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>,) is only a corruption of the name Christ, similar to that found on three or four inscriptions before the time of Constantine, where Christians are called <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, and to the formation of the French word <span class="accented">Chretien</span> - in old French <span class="accented">Chrestien</span>; and that the true account of these riots is that they were attacks of the unbelieving Jews upon Christian Jews, similar to these at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>.), at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>), at Iconium and Lystra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14.htm">Acts 14</a>.), and at Thessalonica and Beraea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>.). The Romans did not discriminate between Jews and Christian Jews, and thought that those who called Christ their King were fighting under his leadership (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>; see Renan, 'St. Paul,' p. 101). Tertullian and Lactantius (quoted by Lewin, p. 274) both speak of the vulgar pronunciation, Chres-<span class="accented">tianus</span> and <span class="accented">Chrestus.</span> Howson also adopts the above explanation. But Meyer thinks that Chrestus was, as Suetonius says, a Jewish leader of insurrection at Rome. The question bears on the passage before us chiefly as the solution does or does not prove the existence of Christians at Rome at this time, and affects the probability of Aquila and Priscilla being already Christians when they came to Corinth, before they made St. Paul's acquaintance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Though Paul was entitled to support from the churches he planted, and from the people to whom he preached, yet he worked at his calling. An honest trade, by which a man may get his bread, is not to be looked upon with contempt by any. It was the custom of the Jews to bring up their children to some trade, though they gave them learning or estates. Paul was careful to prevent prejudices, even the most unreasonable. The love of Christ is the best bond of the saints; and the communings of the saints with each other, sweeten labour, contempt, and even persecution. Most of the Jews persisted in contradicting the gospel of Christ, and blasphemed. They would not believe themselves, and did all they could to keep others from believing. Paul hereupon left them. He did not give over his work; for though Israel be not gathered, Christ and his gospel shall be glorious. The Jews could not complain, for they had the first offer. When some oppose the gospel, we must turn to others. Grief that many persist in unbelief should not prevent gratitude for the conversion of some to Christ.</body></html>
