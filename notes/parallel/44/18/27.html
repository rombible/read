He felt, we may believe, that his training in the philosophical thought of Alexandria qualified him to carry on there the work which St. Paul had begun both there and at Athens. One who had written, or even read, the noble utterances of Wisdom 1, 2, was well qualified to carry an aggressive warfare into the camp of the Epicureans, while thoughts like those of Wisdom 7, 8, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-7.htm" title="And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as men can have nothing more profitable in their life.">Wisdom Of Solomon 8:7</a>, with its recognition of the four cardinal virtues of Greek ethics, "temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude," would attract the sympathy of the nobler followers of Zeno.<p><span class= "bld">The brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him.</span>--This is the first instance of what were afterwards known technically as "letters of commendation" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>), written by one church to another in favour of the bearer. The fact that they were given by the Christian community at Ephesus shows now favourable an impression Apollos had made there. It is probable that St. Paul alludes indirectly to these letters in the passage just referred to. The partisans of Apollos had referred to them as one of the points in which he excelled St. Paul. He had come with letters of commendation. He had received them when he left Corinth. The Apostle answers the disparaging taunt in the language of a noble indignation. He needed no such epistle. The church which he had planted was itself an epistle, "known and read of all men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.">2Corinthians 3:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Helped them much which had believed through grace.</span>--The two last words admit, in the Greek as in the English, of being taken either with "helped" or "believed." The former construction seems preferable. It was through the grace of God, co-operating with the gift of wisdom, that Apollos was able to lead men to a higher stage of thought. It will be noted that this exactly corresponds with the account which St. Paul gives of his relation to the teacher whom some set up against him as a rival: "I have planted; Apollos watered," "I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.">1Corinthians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon.

Nothing can be more natural than the course of events here described. In his intimate intercourse with Priscilla and Aquila, Apollos had necessarily heard much of the great work at Corinth, and the flourishing Church there; and so he longed to see for himself and to exercise his powers in watering what St. Paul had so well planted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>). Priscilla and Aquila having heard his eloquent sermons at Ephesus, and being interested in the Corinthian Church, seem to have encouraged him, and to have joined with the other disciples at Ephesus in giving him commendatory letters to the Church of Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">Encouraged him</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, a word found nowhere else in the New Testament, but used in classical Greek and in the Apocrypha, in the sense of "exhorting," "urging." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> are hortatory words. In medical writers a "stimulant" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. There is a difference of opinion among commentators whether the exhortation was addressed to Apollos, as the R.V. takes it, or to the brethren at Corinth, as the A.V. understands it. It seems rather more consonant to the structure of the sentence and to the probability of the case that the exhortation was addressed to the Corinthian Church, and not to Apollos, who needed no such encouragement, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is equivalent to "wrote and exhorted." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:24-28 Apollos taught in the gospel of Christ, as far as John's ministry would carry him, and no further. We cannot but think he had heard of Christ's death and resurrection, but he was not informed as to the mystery of them. Though he had not the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, as the apostles, he made use of the gifts he had. The dispensation of the Spirit, whatever the measure of it may be, is given to every man to profit withal. He was a lively, affectionate preacher; fervent in spirit. He was full of zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of precious souls. Here was a complete man of God, thoroughly furnished for his work. Aquila and Priscilla encouraged his ministry, by attendance upon it. They did not despise Apollos themselves, or undervalue him to others; but considered the disadvantages he had laboured under. And having themselves got knowledge in the truths of the gospel by their long intercourse with Paul, they told what they knew to him. Young scholars may gain a great deal by converse with old Christians. Those who do believe through grace, yet still need help. As long as they are in this world, there are remainders of unbelief, and something lacking in their faith to be perfected, and the work of faith to be fulfilled. If the Jews were convinced that Jesus is Christ, even their own law would teach them to hear him. The business of ministers is to preach Christ. Not only to preach the truth, but to prove and defend it, with meekness, yet with power.</body></html>
