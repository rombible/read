(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>.) If he missed that, there would be no other feast till that of Tabernacles; and then, in October, travelling, whether by sea or land, became dangerous and difficult. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">If God will.</span>--In this resting in the thought of the will of the Father as ordering all things well--even in their use of almost the same formula, to them much more than such a formula as the <span class= "ital">Deo volente</span> has often become in the lips of Christians--we find another point of agreement between St. Paul and St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-15.htm" title="For that you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.">James 4:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> <span class="accented">- Taking his leave of them, and saying</span> for <span class="accented">bade them farewell, saying</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">I will return</span> for <span class="accented">I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem</span>; <span class="accented">but I will return</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">he set sail</span> for and he <span class="accented">sailed</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Taking his leave</span>; as in ver. 18, note. <span class="cmt_word">I must by all means</span>, etc. This clause is not found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, E, and several versions, and is omitted in the R.T. But Alford, Meyer, Wordsworth, and others consider it to be genuine. It is certainly difficult to account for such words being inserted in the text if they were not genuine; whereas it is easy to account for their omission, either by accident or from the fact that the brevity of the allusion to his visit to Jerusalem in ver. 22 might easily mislead a copyist into thinking that St. Paul did not go to Jerusalem at this time, and therefore that the words were misplaced. Observe how St. Paul's fixed purpose to reach Jerusalem as soon as possible tallies with the account of his vow. <span class="cmt_word">This feast</span> (A.V.). It is not clear what feast is meant. Alford, Wordsworth, ' Speaker's Commentary,' and others, following Wieseler, think it was the Feast of Pentecost, being influenced by the consideration that sailing was dangerous and very unusual so early as before the Passover. But Meyer thinks it uncertain. But the expression, "I must by all means," would cover the risk of a voyage in the stormy season. <span class="cmt_word">I will return again</span>. The fulfillment of this promise is related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">If God will</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 While Paul found he laboured not in vain, he continued labouring. Our times are in God's hand; we purpose, but he disposes; therefore we must make all promises with submission to the will of God; not only if providence permits, but if God does not otherwise direct our motions. A very good refreshment it is to a faithful minister, to have for awhile the society of his brethren. Disciples are compassed about with infirmity; ministers must do what they can to strengthen them, by directing them to Christ, who is their Strength. Let us earnestly seek, in our several places, to promote the cause of Christ, forming plans that appear to us most proper, but relying on the Lord to bring them to pass if he sees good.</body></html>
