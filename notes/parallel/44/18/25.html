The "way of the Lord" is used in a half-technical sense, as in the phrase "those of the way" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>), as equivalent to what, in modern speech, we should describe as the "religion" of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">And being fervent in the spirit.</span>--The noun is obviously used, as in the identical phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-11.htm" title="Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;">Romans 12:11</a>, for the spirit of the man, not for the Holy Spirit of God.<p><span class= "bld">He spake and taught diligently.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">he was speaking and teaching accurately.</span> Both verbs are in the tense which implies continuous action.<p><span class= "bld">The things of the Lord.</span>--The better MSS. give, "the things concerning Jesus." We ask in what the teaching, which is thus described as accurate, was yet defective. The position of Apollos at this stage was, it would seem, that of one who knew the facts of our Lord's life, and death, and resurrection, and had learnt, comparing these with Messianic prophecies, to accept Him as the Christ. But his teacher had been one who had not gone beyond the standpoint of the followers of the Baptist, who accepted Jesus as the Christ during His ministry on earth. The Christ was for him the head of a glorified Judaism, retaining all its distinctive features. He had not as yet learnt that "circumcision was nothing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>), and that the Temple and all its ordinances were "decaying and waxing old, and ready to vanish away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Knowing only the baptism of John.</span>--The words are full of interest, as showing a wider extent in the work of the Baptist, as the forerunner of the Christ, than is indicated in the Gospels. Even at Alexandria, probably among the ascetic communities of the Therapeutae, whose life was fashioned upon the same model, there were those who had come under his influence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> <span class="accented">- Had been</span> for was, A.V.; <span class="accented">spirit</span> for <span class="accented">the spirit</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">carefully</span> for <span class="accented">diligently</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">things concerning Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">things of the Lord</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him</span> for <span class="accented">whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">carefully</span> for <span class="accented">perfectly</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Knowing only the baptism of John</span>. It is difficult at first sight to conceive how at this time any one could know the baptism of John without knowing further that of Christ. But a possible account of it is that Apollos living at Alexandria, where as yet there was no Christian Church. had met some Jews who had been in Judaea at the time of John's ministry, and had heard from them of John's baptism and preaching, and of his testimony to Jesus as the Messiah, but had had no further opportunity of careful instruction in the faith of Jesus Christ till he happened to come to Ephesus and make the acquaintance of his compatriots, Aquila and Priscilla. They hearing him speak with fervor and eloquence, but perceiving that his knowledge was imperfect, immediately invited him to their house, and instructed him in the fullness of the truth of the gospel. This necessarily included the doctrine of Christian baptism, which we cannot doubt was administered to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:24-28 Apollos taught in the gospel of Christ, as far as John's ministry would carry him, and no further. We cannot but think he had heard of Christ's death and resurrection, but he was not informed as to the mystery of them. Though he had not the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, as the apostles, he made use of the gifts he had. The dispensation of the Spirit, whatever the measure of it may be, is given to every man to profit withal. He was a lively, affectionate preacher; fervent in spirit. He was full of zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of precious souls. Here was a complete man of God, thoroughly furnished for his work. Aquila and Priscilla encouraged his ministry, by attendance upon it. They did not despise Apollos themselves, or undervalue him to others; but considered the disadvantages he had laboured under. And having themselves got knowledge in the truths of the gospel by their long intercourse with Paul, they told what they knew to him. Young scholars may gain a great deal by converse with old Christians. Those who do believe through grace, yet still need help. As long as they are in this world, there are remainders of unbelief, and something lacking in their faith to be perfected, and the work of faith to be fulfilled. If the Jews were convinced that Jesus is Christ, even their own law would teach them to hear him. The business of ministers is to preach Christ. Not only to preach the truth, but to prove and defend it, with meekness, yet with power.</body></html>
