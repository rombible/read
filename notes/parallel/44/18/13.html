Their contention was that though Jews had been banished from Rome as a measure of policy, Judaism as such was still a <span class= "ital">relligio licita, </span>tolerated and recognised by the State. Their charge against the Apostle was that he was preaching a new religion, which was not so recognised. The words "this fellow," though the substantive is an interpolation, fairly expresses the contempt implied in the use of the Greek pronoun.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Man</span> for <span class="accented">fellow</span>, A.V.

Hence Gallio's answer in ver. 15, "If it be a question... of your Law, look ye to it." The very phrase, to "worship God," had a technical sense (see above, ver. 7). Paul, they said, professed to make proselytes, and encouraged them to break the Law. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:12-17 Paul was about to show that he did not teach men to worship God contrary to law; but the judge would not allow the Jews to complain to him of what was not within his office. It was right in Gallio that he left the Jews to themselves in matters relating to their religion, but yet would not let them, under pretence of that, persecute another. But it was wrong to speak slightly of a law and religion which he might have known to be of God, and which he ought to have acquainted himself with. In what way God is to be worshipped, whether Jesus be the Messiah, and whether the gospel be a Divine revelation, are not questions of words and names, they are questions of vast importance. Gallio spoke as if he boasted of his ignorance of the Scriptures, as if the law of God was beneath his notice. Gallio cared for none of these things. If he cared not for the affronts of bad men, it was commendable; but if he concerned not himself for the abuses done to good men, his indifference was carried too far. And those who see and hear of the sufferings of God's people, and have no feeling with them, or care for them, who do not pity and pray for them, are of the same spirit as Gallio, who cared for none of these things.</body></html>
