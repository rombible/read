In favour of so conspicuous a convert, St. Paul deviated from his usual practice, and baptised Crispus with his own hands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;">1Corinthians 1:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</span>--The tense of the two verbs implies a process going on daily for an undefined period. Among the converts we may note Gaius, or Caius, probably a man of higher social position than others, who made his house the meeting-place of the Church, and at St. Paul's second visit received him as a guest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>), and the household of Stephanas, who, as "the first-fruits of Achaia," must have been among the earliest converts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm" title="I beseech you, brothers, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)">1Corinthians 16:15</a>).

It is seldom that we have the names of so many converts preserved as we have of this Achaian mission. Besides Crispus and Gaius, we know of Epaenetus and Stephanas, who would seem to have been converted together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>); and probably also Fortunatus and Achaicus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-17.htm">1 Corinthians 16:17</a>). Gains, from his name (Caius) and his salutation to the Church at Rome, was probably a Roman. Fortunatus and Achaicus also be-belonged, perhaps, to the Roman colony. Here too were many heathen converts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>), though mostly of the lower rank (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:7-11 The Lord knows those that are his, yea, and those that shall be his; for it is by his work upon them that they become his.
