The material was one used for the sails of ships and for tents, and on the whole, though some have supposed that leather was used for the latter, it seems more probable that this was the material which St. Paul worked at. It may be added that Pontus, from which Aquila came, was also famous for the same manufacture, the material in each case being furnished by the goats which fed upon the slopes of the Taurus, and the mountain ranges of that province. The fact that St. Paul had learnt this trade is not inconsistent with the comparative opulence suggested by his education both in boyhood at Tarsus and at the feet of Gamaliel in Jerusalem. The Rabbinic proverb, that "He who does not teach his son a trade, teaches him to be a thief," made such instruction almost universal. So the great Hillel was a carpenter. Here, it is clear, he took the course of working for his livelihood, as he had done at Thessalonica, that he might keep himself from the suspicion of self-interest in his work as a teacher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.">1Corinthians 9:15-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?">2Corinthians 11:7-13</a>). Such was the beginning of his labours at Corinth. A new artisan was working for wages, or as a partner, probably the latter, as afterwards with Philemon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-17.htm" title="If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.">Philemon 1:17</a>), in the workshop of the Jew, not as yet known to the outer world as more than a Jew, who had recently arrived in Corinth from Rome.<p>(3) We may add to this motive the principle on which St. Paul acted of being "all things to all men," and, therefore, as a Jew to Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;">1Corinthians 9:20</a>). A Nazarite vow would testify to all his brethren by blood that he did not despise the Law himself nor teach other Jews to despise it. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21-24</a>.) Such a vow, involving, as it did, for a time a greater asceticism than that of common life, furnishes a link in the succession of thoughts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-22.htm" title="To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.">1Corinthians 9:22-25</a>, between the Apostle's being made "all things to all men" and his "keeping under his body, and bringing it into subjection."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Trade</span> for <span class="accented">craft</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">they wrought</span> for (he) <span class="accented">wrought</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">trade</span> for <span class="accented">occupation</span>, A.V.

Hug and others erroneously interpret it "makers of tent-cloth," from the fact that a certain kind of cloth made of goats' hair, called <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, was manufactured in Paul's native country of Cilicia. But the fact of such manufacture would equally lead persons who were living in Cilicia to exercise the trade of making tents of the cloth so manufactured. St. Paul alludes to his manual labor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8, 9</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Though Paul was entitled to support from the churches he planted, and from the people to whom he preached, yet he worked at his calling. An honest trade, by which a man may get his bread, is not to be looked upon with contempt by any. It was the custom of the Jews to bring up their children to some trade, though they gave them learning or estates. Paul was careful to prevent prejudices, even the most unreasonable. The love of Christ is the best bond of the saints; and the communings of the saints with each other, sweeten labour, contempt, and even persecution. Most of the Jews persisted in contradicting the gospel of Christ, and blasphemed. They would not believe themselves, and did all they could to keep others from believing. Paul hereupon left them. He did not give over his work; for though Israel be not gathered, Christ and his gospel shall be glorious. The Jews could not complain, for they had the first offer. When some oppose the gospel, we must turn to others. Grief that many persist in unbelief should not prevent gratitude for the conversion of some to Christ.</body></html>
