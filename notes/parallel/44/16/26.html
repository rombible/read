St. Luke always follows the Attic usage of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, in the neuter (romp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-29.htm">Luke 8:29</a>). St. Paul follows the Hellenistic usage of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, in the masculine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm">Philippians 1:13</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-5.htm">Jeremiah 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>). In many instances (genitive and dative) it is, of course, impossible to determine whether the word is masculine or neuter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:25-34 The consolations of God to his suffering servants are neither few nor small. How much more happy are true Christians than their prosperous enemies! As in the dark, so out of the depths, we may cry unto God. No place, no time is amiss for prayer, if the heart be lifted up to God. No trouble, however grievous, should hinder us from praise. Christianity proves itself to be of God, in that it obliges us to be just to our own lives. Paul cried aloud to make the jailer hear, and to make him heed, saying, Do thyself no harm. All the cautions of the word of God against sin, and all appearances of it, and approaches to it, have this tendency. Man, woman, do not ruin thyself; hurt not thyself, and then none else can hurt thee; do not sin, for nothing but that can hurt thee. Even as to the body, we are cautioned against the sins which do harm to that. Converting grace changes people's language of and to good people and good ministers. How serious the jailer's inquiry! His salvation becomes his great concern; that lies nearest his heart, which before was furthest from his thoughts. It is his own precious soul that he is concerned about. Those who are thoroughly convinced of sin, and truly concerned about their salvation, will give themselves up to Christ. Here is the sum of the whole gospel, the covenant of grace in a few words; Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. The Lord so blessed the word, that the jailer was at once softened and humbled. He treated them with kindness and compassion, and, professing faith in Christ, was baptized in that name, with his family. The Spirit of grace worked such a strong faith in them, as did away further doubt; and Paul and Silas knew by the Spirit, that a work of God was wrought in them. When sinners are thus converted, they will love and honour those whom they before despised and hated, and will seek to lessen the suffering they before desired to increase. When the fruits of faith begin to appear, terrors will be followed by confidence and joy in God.</body></html>
