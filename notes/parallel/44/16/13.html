Where they had no synagogue, and in a military station like Philippi there was not likely to be one, the Jews frequented the river-banks, which made ablutions easy, and often succeeded in getting a piece of ground assigned for that purpose outside the walls of the city. Juvenal (<span class= "ital">Sat. iii.</span> 11-13) notes this as one of the instances of the decay of the old faith of Rome:<p>"The groves and streams which once were sacred ground<p>Are now let out td Jews."<p>The local meaning is seen in another line from the same writer (<span class= "ital">Sat.</span> iii. 296):<p>"Ede, ubi consistas, in qua te quaero, proseucha?"<p>["Say where thou dwell'st, and in what place of prayer<p>I am to seek thee?"]<p>The oratories, or <span class= "ital">proseuchae, </span>thus formed, were commonly circular, and without a roof. The practice continued in the time of Tertullian, who speaks of the "orationes litorales" of the Jews (<span class= "ital">ad Nat.</span> i. 13). The river, in this instance, was the Gangites. Finding no synagogue in the city, and hearing of the oratory, the company of preachers went out to it to take their part in the Sabbath services, and to preach Christ to any Jews they might find there.<p><span class= "bld">We sat down, and spake unto the women.</span>--The fact that there were only women shows the almost entire absence of a Jewish population. Possibly, too, the decree of Claudius, expelling the Jews from Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>), was enforced, as stated above, in the <span class= "ital">colonia, </span>which was as a part of Rome, and as Jewesses would not be likely to have settled there without their husbands or brothers, it is probable that the women whom St. Paul found assembled were, like Lydia, proselytes who desired to remain faithful to their new faith, even in the absence of any settled provision for their instruction. Women thus placed would naturally welcome the presence of strangers who, probably, wore the garb of a Rabbi, and who showed when they sat down (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-14.htm" title="But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.">Acts 13:14</a>) that they were about to preach. We note that here also the narrator speaks of himself as teaching. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm" title="And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel to them.">Acts 16:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Sabbath day</span> for <span class="accented">sabbath</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">we went forth without the gate</span> for <span class="accented">we went out of the city</span>, A.V. and T.R.

By <span class="accented">the</span> river side is the natural way of expressing it in English. The river is not the Strymon, which is a day's journey distant from Philippi, but probably a small stream called the Gangas or Gangites, which is crossed by the Via Eguatia, about a mile out of Philippi. The neighborhood of water, either near a stream or on the seashore, was usually preferred by the Jews as a place for prayer, as affording facility for ablutions (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 14:10, 23; and other passages quoted by Alford). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, should be rendered, not as in the R.V., but more nearly as the A.V., <span class="accented">where a prayer-meeting</span>(<span class="accented">of</span> the Jews) <span class="accented">was accustomed to be held</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this particular spot was the usual place where such Jews or proselytes as happened to be at Philippi met for prayer. It also appears from Epiphanius (' Hear.,' 80, &sect; 1, quoted by Alford) that the Jews usually had their <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, whether buildings, or open spaces, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, outside the city. The wayside crosses are of the nature of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-15 The removals of ministers, and the dispensing the means of grace by them, are in particular under Divine conduct and direction. We must follow Providence: and whatever we seek to do, if that suffer us not, we ought to submit and believe to be for the best. People greatly need help for their souls, it is their duty to look out for it, and to invite those among them who can help them. And God's calls must be complied with readily. A solemn assembly the worshippers of God must have, if possible, upon the sabbath day. If we have not synagogues, we must be thankful for more private places, and resort to them; not forsaking the assembling together, as our opportunities are. Among the hearers of Paul was a woman, named Lydia. She had an honest calling, which the historian notices to her praise. Yet though she had a calling to mind, she found time to improve advantages for her soul. It will not excuse us from religious duties, to say, We have a trade to mind; for have not we also a God to serve, and souls to look after? Religion does not call us from our business in the world, but directs us in it. Pride, prejudice, and sin shut out the truths of God, till his grace makes way for them into the understanding and affections; and the Lord alone can open the heart to receive and believe his word. We must believe in Jesus Christ; there is no coming to God as a Father, but by the Son as Mediator.</body></html>
