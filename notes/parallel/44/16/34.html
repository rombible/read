If the tumult had begun, as is probable, as they were going to the <span class= "ital">proseuclia</span> for morning prayer, at the third hour of the day (9 A.M.), they had probably been fasting for nearly twenty-four hours. They were not likely to have made a meal when they were thrust into the dungeon. The "joy" of the meal reminds us of that noted as a chief feature of the social life of the disciples at Jerusalem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>. The new hope, succeeding to the blank despair, brought with it what we may well describe as a new "joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>). The absence of the specific term of "breaking bread" excludes the idea of its having been, in the later sense of the term, an eucharistic feast; and St. Paul would probably have hesitated to admit the new convert to the Supper of the Lord without further instruction, such as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.">1Corinthians 10:15-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20-34</a>; but the meal at which the teachers and the disciples, so strangely brought together, now sat down may, at any rate, be thought of as an <span class= "ital">agape </span>or "feast of charity." (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- He brought them up</span>... <span class="accented">and set</span> for <span class="accented">when he had brought them</span>... <span class="accented">he set</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">rejoiced greatly</span> for <span class="accented">rejoiced</span>, A.V.

But it is used by the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1</a> and elsewhere, and by Josephus, etc. The more classical form is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>. The A.V. gives the meaning better than the R.V. The faith and the joy were both common to the jailor and his house. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:25-34 The consolations of God to his suffering servants are neither few nor small. How much more happy are true Christians than their prosperous enemies! As in the dark, so out of the depths, we may cry unto God. No place, no time is amiss for prayer, if the heart be lifted up to God. No trouble, however grievous, should hinder us from praise. Christianity proves itself to be of God, in that it obliges us to be just to our own lives. Paul cried aloud to make the jailer hear, and to make him heed, saying, Do thyself no harm. All the cautions of the word of God against sin, and all appearances of it, and approaches to it, have this tendency. Man, woman, do not ruin thyself; hurt not thyself, and then none else can hurt thee; do not sin, for nothing but that can hurt thee. Even as to the body, we are cautioned against the sins which do harm to that. Converting grace changes people's language of and to good people and good ministers. How serious the jailer's inquiry! His salvation becomes his great concern; that lies nearest his heart, which before was furthest from his thoughts. It is his own precious soul that he is concerned about. Those who are thoroughly convinced of sin, and truly concerned about their salvation, will give themselves up to Christ. Here is the sum of the whole gospel, the covenant of grace in a few words; Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. The Lord so blessed the word, that the jailer was at once softened and humbled. He treated them with kindness and compassion, and, professing faith in Christ, was baptized in that name, with his family. The Spirit of grace worked such a strong faith in them, as did away further doubt; and Paul and Silas knew by the Spirit, that a work of God was wrought in them. When sinners are thus converted, they will love and honour those whom they before despised and hated, and will seek to lessen the suffering they before desired to increase. When the fruits of faith begin to appear, terrors will be followed by confidence and joy in God.</body></html>
