(See <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke's</span> <span class= "ital">Gospel.</span>) The other hypothesis, that he incorporates a narrative written by Silas or Timotheus, is not probable in itself, and would naturally have involved an earlier change in the form of the narrative. Accepting the received view, it seems to follow, as there is no mention of the conversion of the Evangelist, that St. Paul and St. Luke must have been already known to each other, probably either at Tarsus or Antioch, the fulness with which the history of the latter Church is given pointing to it as the scene of their previous intimacy. On this assumption, the narrator must have left Antioch after the Council of Jerusalem, probably after the dispute between Paul and Barnabas, and travelled through the interior of Asia Minor, in part, perhaps, in the track of St. Paul's earlier journey; and so gathered materials for his history till he came to Troas, and there carried on his work as an evangelist. The manner in which St. Luke introduces himself ("the Lord had called <span class= "ital">us</span>") implies, it may be noted, that he too was a preacher of the gospel. There is no record here of any mission-work done by St. Paul; but the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>, and, yet more, the facts of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>, imply the existence of a Christian community. We may look, accordingly, on St. Luke as the founder of the Church of Troas, and place this among the "labours in the gospel" to which St. Paul refers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2Corinthians 8:18</a>. The "we endeavoured" (literally, <span class= "ital">we sought</span>) implies an immediate inquiry as to what ship was sailing, bound for any port of Macedonia. Such a call as that which had been given in the vision admitted of no delay. It came from the Lord Jesus, as the sequel of that given in the vision in the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17-21</a>), and was, therefore, to be obeyed at once.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - When for <span class="accented">after</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">straightway</span> for <span class="accented">immediately</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sought</span> for endeavor<span class="accented">ed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">go forth</span> for <span class="accented">go</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">concluding</span> fur <span class="accented">assuredly gathering</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">God</span> for the <span class="accented">Lord</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Concluding</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, only here in the sense of "concluding or "gathering." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-22.htm">Acts 9:22</a> it is "proving." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a> it means to "join together." In classical Greek to "bring together" in the sense of" reconciling," sometimes of" agreeing" to a proposition. In the LXX., to ,' instruct," "teach" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>). In this verse we first remark the very important introduction of the pronoun we into the narrative, marking the presence of the historian himself, and showing that he first joined St. Paul at Tread He went with him to Philippi (ver. 12), and there he appears to have stopped till St. Paul returned there in his third missionary journey on his way from Achaia to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5, 6</a>), where we find him still with the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17, 18</a>). We again find him with St. Paul at Caesarea, while he was a prisoner there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>), and he accompanied him on the voyage to Rome, which is the last place where we heir of him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2, 3</a>. etc.; Acts 28:2, 11, 14-16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>). It is quite characteristic of Holy Scripture that things are told, or appear on the face of the narrative, without any explanation. Who Luke was, what brought him to Troas, how he became a companion of St. Paul, whether as his medical adviser or otherwise, we know not. His Christian modesty forbade his speaking about himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-15 The removals of ministers, and the dispensing the means of grace by them, are in particular under Divine conduct and direction. We must follow Providence: and whatever we seek to do, if that suffer us not, we ought to submit and believe to be for the best. People greatly need help for their souls, it is their duty to look out for it, and to invite those among them who can help them. And God's calls must be complied with readily. A solemn assembly the worshippers of God must have, if possible, upon the sabbath day. If we have not synagogues, we must be thankful for more private places, and resort to them; not forsaking the assembling together, as our opportunities are. Among the hearers of Paul was a woman, named Lydia. She had an honest calling, which the historian notices to her praise. Yet though she had a calling to mind, she found time to improve advantages for her soul. It will not excuse us from religious duties, to say, We have a trade to mind; for have not we also a God to serve, and souls to look after? Religion does not call us from our business in the world, but directs us in it. Pride, prejudice, and sin shut out the truths of God, till his grace makes way for them into the understanding and affections; and the Lord alone can open the heart to receive and believe his word. We must believe in Jesus Christ; there is no coming to God as a Father, but by the Son as Mediator.</body></html>
