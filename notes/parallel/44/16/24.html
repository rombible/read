And, as if this were not enough, they were fastened in the "stocks." St. Luke uses the Greek term <span class= "ital">xylon, </span>the same as is used sometimes for the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-30.htm" title="The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-29.htm" title="And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher.">Acts 13:29</a>). The technical Latin word was <span class= "ital">nervus.</span> Like the English stocks, it was a wooden frame with five holes, into which head and feet and arms were thrust, and the prisoner left in an attitude of "little-ease." Here, however, it would seem, the feet only were fastened, the rest of the body being left lying on the ground. If the Received version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm" title="You put my feet also in the stocks, and look narrowly to all my paths; you set a print on the heels of my feet.">Job 13:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm" title="He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths.">Job 33:11</a>, which follows the LXX. and the Vulgate, be correct, the punishment was common at a very early period in the East.

Sometimes it was a kind of heavy wooden collar put on the neck of a prisoner, whence the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3a7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (Aristoph., 'Nubes,' 592)," To make fast his neck in the pillory." Sometimes it was what Aristophanes calls <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "stocks with five holes," two for the feet, two for the hands, and one for the neck. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a> (where the LXX. word is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, a stake, or log), it is simply" the stocks." Thus Paul and Silas, first stripped and 1,catch, then put in the inner prison, and further made fast in the stocks, were treated with the utmost possible rigour and severity. See St. Paul's vivid reminiscence of the outrage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:16-24 Satan, though the father of lies, will declare the most important truths, when he can thereby serve his purposes. But much mischief is done to the real servants of Christ, by unholy and false preachers of the gospel, who are confounded with them by careless observers. Those who do good by drawing men from sin, may expect to be reviled as troublers of the city. While they teach men to fear God, to believe in Christ, to forsake sin, and to live godly lives, they will be accused of teaching bad customs.</body></html>
