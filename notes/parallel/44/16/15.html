The statement that "her household" were baptised has often been urged as evidence that infant baptism was the practice of the apostolic age. It must be admitted, however, that this is to read a great deal between the lines, and the utmost that can be said is that the language of the writer does not exclude infants. The practice itself rests on firmer grounds than a precarious induction from a few ambiguous passages. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/19-13.htm" title="Then were there brought to him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.">Matthew 19:13-15</a>.) In this instance, moreover, there is no evidence that she had children, or even that she was married. The "household" may well have consisted of female slaves and freed-women whom she employed, and who made up her <span class= "ital">familia.</span> It follows, almost as a necessary inference, that many of these also were previously proselytes. For such as these, Judaism had been a "schoolmaster," leading them to Christ. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24</a>.) We may think of Euodias and Syntyche, and the other women who "laboured in the gospel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2-3</a>), as having been, probably, among them. The names of the first two occur frequently in the inscriptions of the <span class= "ital">Columbaria</span> of this period, now in the Vatican and Lateran Museums, the Borghese Gardens, and elsewhere, as belonging to women of the slave or <span class= "ital">libertinae</span> class.<p><span class= "bld">She besought us.</span>--Up to this time the teachers, four in number, had been, we must believe, living in a lodging and maintaining themselves, as usual, by labour--St. Paul as a tentmaker, St. Luke, probably, as a physician. Now the large-hearted hospitality of Lydia (the offer implies a certain measure of wealth, as, indeed, did her occupation, which required a considerable capital) led her to receive them as her guests. They did not readily abandon the independent position which their former practice secured them, and only yield to the kind "constraint" to which they were exposed.<p><span class= "bld">If ye have judged.</span>--The words contain a modest, almost a pathetic, appeal to the fact that the preachers had recognised her faith by admitting her to baptism. If she was fit for that, was she unfit to be their hostess?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When she was baptized</span>; showing that St. Paul, as St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38, 41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-47.htm">Acts 10:47</a>), as Philip (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-38.htm">Acts 8:38</a>), as Ananias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>), as our Lord himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>), had put holy baptism in the very forefront of his teaching (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm">Hebrews 6:2</a>). And her household (comp. ver. 33; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-16.htm">1 Corinthians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>). This frequent mention of whole households as received into the Church seems necessarily to imply infant baptism. The exhortations to children as members of the Church in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1, 2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-20.htm">Colossians 3:20</a>, lead to the same inference. <span class="cmt_word">Come into my house</span>, etc. A beautiful specimen of true hospitality; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10</a> 3John 5-8; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8-10</a>, where, however, the Greek word for "constrained" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, not as here <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, which only occurs elsewhere in the New Testament in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-29.htm">Luke 24:29</a>. In the LXX. it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-23.htm">1 Samuel 28:23</a>; Gem 19:3 (Cod.

Her large hospitality does not bear out Chrysostom's remark as to her humble station of lift,. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-15 The removals of ministers, and the dispensing the means of grace by them, are in particular under Divine conduct and direction. We must follow Providence: and whatever we seek to do, if that suffer us not, we ought to submit and believe to be for the best. People greatly need help for their souls, it is their duty to look out for it, and to invite those among them who can help them. And God's calls must be complied with readily. A solemn assembly the worshippers of God must have, if possible, upon the sabbath day. If we have not synagogues, we must be thankful for more private places, and resort to them; not forsaking the assembling together, as our opportunities are. Among the hearers of Paul was a woman, named Lydia. She had an honest calling, which the historian notices to her praise. Yet though she had a calling to mind, she found time to improve advantages for her soul. It will not excuse us from religious duties, to say, We have a trade to mind; for have not we also a God to serve, and souls to look after? Religion does not call us from our business in the world, but directs us in it. Pride, prejudice, and sin shut out the truths of God, till his grace makes way for them into the understanding and affections; and the Lord alone can open the heart to receive and believe his word. We must believe in Jesus Christ; there is no coming to God as a Father, but by the Son as Mediator.</body></html>
