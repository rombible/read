As the third person is now resumed, we may infer that St. Luke remained at Philippi, Timothy accompanying the other two. It would seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a> that the Evangelist made Philippi the centre of his evangelising work for many years. Under the care of the beloved physician, the good work went on, and we may probably trace to his influence, and to Lydia's kindness, the generous help which was sent to St. Paul once and again when he was at Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15-16</a>), and, probably, at Corinth also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>). Long years afterwards he cherished a grateful memory of the men and women who had laboured with him at Philippi. Among these we may think of the Clement, of whom he thus speaks, possibly identical with the Flavius Clemens, who occupies a prominent position among the apostolic fathers, and was traditionally the third Bishop of Rome. (See, however, Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Philippians 4:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Departed</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from Philippi, according to the magistrates' request in ver. 39. This is much clearer in the T.R. and A.V. than in the Revised Text and Version, because the same word, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is used in both places. The R.T. in ver. 39 - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> destroys the reference, and rather suggests that they merely" went out "of Lydia's house, which they had "entered into." It appears from the first verse of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>. ("<span class="accented">they</span> had passed," etc.) that St. Luke stopped at Philippi, and probably made it his head-quarters till St. Paul's last journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem, some six or seven years later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6</a>). What became of Timothy we are not expressly told, only we find him at Beroea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; and at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>). Probably he accompanied St. Paul, but is not named, being still only a subordinate person in the mission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:35-40 Paul, though willing to suffer for the cause of Christ, and without any desire to avenge himself, did not choose to depart under the charge of having deserved wrongful punishment, and therefore required to be dismissed in an honourable manner. It was not a mere point of honour that the apostle stood upon, but justice, and not to himself so much as to his cause. And when proper apology is made, Christians should never express personal anger, nor insist too strictly upon personal amends. The Lord will make them more than conquerors in every conflict; instead of being cast down by their sufferings, they will become comforters of their brethren.</body></html>
