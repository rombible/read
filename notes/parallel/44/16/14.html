Afra, Graeca, Syra, are familiar examples of like names. "Lydia" occurs, it will be remembered, once and again, in Horace (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 14; iii. 9). Thyatira, one of the cities in the valley of the Lycus, was, like many other towns of Asia Minor, famous for its dyeing works, especially for purple, or crimson, which rivalled the fame of Tyre or Miletus (Strabo, xiii. 4, ? 14). Inscriptions found on the spot bear witness to the existence of a guild, or corporation, of purple-sellers, with which Lydia doubtless was connected. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm" title="Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.">Revelation 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-18.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things said the Son of God, who has his eyes like to a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;">Revelation 2:18</a>, it appears as one of the seven churches to which special epistles were to be sent from their divine Head. It had been founded as a colony, in the modern sense of the term, from Macedonia, as the sequel of the conquest of the Persian monarchy by Alexander the Great, and this may in part explain Lydia's presence at Philippi. The fact that she, and not her husband, is named as the purple-seller, is at least presumptive evidence that she was carrying on the business by herself.<p><span class= "bld">Which worshipped God.</span>--She was, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a proselyte (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>), and, as the sequel shows, one of the better type, drawn to Judaism, not by superstitious fear, or weak credulity, but by the higher ethical and spiritual teaching which it presented.<p><span class= "bld">Heard.</span>--For "heard" read <span class= "ital">was listening.</span><p><span class= "bld">Whose heart the Lord opened.</span>--The scene is one which might well call for the master touches of a great painter.

Thyatira was in Lydia. Lydian women, from the time of Homer downwards, were famous for their purple dyes; and it appears from an inscription found in Thyatira, that there was there a guild of dyers, called <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> (Lewin, 2:214). <span class="cmt_word">One that worshipped God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a proselyte. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-43.htm">Acts 13:43</a> we find <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> the <span class="accented">devout</span> or <span class="accented">religious</span> proselytes. And so <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="accented">devout</span> women. And so, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-7.htm">Acts 18:7</a>, Justus is described as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> one who worshipped God (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4, 17</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a> Cornelius is spoken of as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>. It has been suggested that possibly Euodias and Syntyche (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>) were of the same class, and converted at the same time as Lydia. There is certainly a coincidence between the mention of the women in ver. 13 and the prominence given to the Philippian women in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2, 3</a>. It is well observed by Chrysostom, on the latter part of this verse, "<span class="accented">The</span> opening of the heart was God's work, the attending was hers: so that it was both God's doing and man's" (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>). <span class="accented">To open</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is applied as here to the heart (2 Macc. 1:4); to the eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>); to the ears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-34.htm">Mark 7:34, 35</a>); to the understanding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>); to the Scriptures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>); "Corclausum per se. Dei est id aporire "(Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-15 The removals of ministers, and the dispensing the means of grace by them, are in particular under Divine conduct and direction. We must follow Providence: and whatever we seek to do, if that suffer us not, we ought to submit and believe to be for the best. People greatly need help for their souls, it is their duty to look out for it, and to invite those among them who can help them. And God's calls must be complied with readily. A solemn assembly the worshippers of God must have, if possible, upon the sabbath day. If we have not synagogues, we must be thankful for more private places, and resort to them; not forsaking the assembling together, as our opportunities are. Among the hearers of Paul was a woman, named Lydia. She had an honest calling, which the historian notices to her praise. Yet though she had a calling to mind, she found time to improve advantages for her soul. It will not excuse us from religious duties, to say, We have a trade to mind; for have not we also a God to serve, and souls to look after? Religion does not call us from our business in the world, but directs us in it. Pride, prejudice, and sin shut out the truths of God, till his grace makes way for them into the understanding and affections; and the Lord alone can open the heart to receive and believe his word. We must believe in Jesus Christ; there is no coming to God as a Father, but by the Son as Mediator.</body></html>
