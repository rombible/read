The vision which St. Paul looked on explained to him all the varied promptings and drawings-back of his journey. This was the door that was to be opened to him. The faith of Christ was to pass from Asia to Europe, and the cry, "Come over and help us," was to him as a call from the whole western world. In view of this, he did not now tarry to preach at Troas. Probably, indeed, as the next verse implies, that work had been already done.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- There was a man</span>... <span class="accented">standing, beseeching him, and saying</span> for <span class="accented">there stood a man</span>... <span class="accented">and prayed him, saying</span>, A.V. Thus was ushered in the most momentous event in the history of Europe, the going forth of the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem to enlighten the nations of the West, and bring them into the fold of Jesus Christ. Paul saw and heard this in a vision in the night. It is net called a dream (Bengel), but was like the vision seen by Ananias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10</a>), and those seen by Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-12.htm">Acts 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-5.htm">Acts 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9</a>). A vision (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is distinguished from a dream (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>). It is applied to things of a marvelous character seen objectively, as to the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-9.htm">Matthew 17:9</a>)and to the burning bush (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-31.htm">Acts 7:31</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-15 The removals of ministers, and the dispensing the means of grace by them, are in particular under Divine conduct and direction. We must follow Providence: and whatever we seek to do, if that suffer us not, we ought to submit and believe to be for the best. People greatly need help for their souls, it is their duty to look out for it, and to invite those among them who can help them. And God's calls must be complied with readily. A solemn assembly the worshippers of God must have, if possible, upon the sabbath day. If we have not synagogues, we must be thankful for more private places, and resort to them; not forsaking the assembling together, as our opportunities are. Among the hearers of Paul was a woman, named Lydia. She had an honest calling, which the historian notices to her praise. Yet though she had a calling to mind, she found time to improve advantages for her soul. It will not excuse us from religious duties, to say, We have a trade to mind; for have not we also a God to serve, and souls to look after? Religion does not call us from our business in the world, but directs us in it. Pride, prejudice, and sin shut out the truths of God, till his grace makes way for them into the understanding and affections; and the Lord alone can open the heart to receive and believe his word. We must believe in Jesus Christ; there is no coming to God as a Father, but by the Son as Mediator.</body></html>
