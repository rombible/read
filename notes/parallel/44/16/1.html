On his probable conversion on St. Paul's first mission in Lystra, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-6.htm" title="They were ware of it, and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the region that lies round about:">Acts 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm" title="And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.">Acts 14:19</a>. We have to think of him as still young; probably, as his youth is spoken of some twelve years later in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1Timothy 4:12</a>, not more than eighteen or twenty; but in the six years that had passed since St. Paul's departure he had been conspicuous for his devotion and "unfeigned faith." He had been trained to know the sacred Books of Israel from his childhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm" title="And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.">2Timothy 3:15</a>); and the fact that he had obtained a good report from the brethren at Iconium as well as Lystra shows that he had been already employed in carrying on intercourse between the two churches. The way in which St. Paul writes to him, and of him, implies a constitution naturally not strong, and, in after life, weakened by a rigorous asceticism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm" title="Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.">1Timothy 5:23</a>), emotional even to tears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a>), naturally shrinking from hardships and responsibilities, yet facing them in the strength of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>). The name Timotheus was not uncommon. It is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/12-21.htm" title="Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas' coming, he sent the women and children and the other baggage unto a fortress called Carnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy to come unto, by reason of the straitness of all the places.">2 Maccabees 12:21-24</a>, as belonging to a general defeated by Judas Maccabeus, and appears in early Christian inscriptions in the Vatican Museum. Its meaning ("one who honours God") made it a suitable name for the child of a proselyte.<p><span class= "bld">The son of a certain woman.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of a certain woman, a faithful</span> (or <span class= "ital">believing</span>)<span class= "ital"> Jewess.</span> The adjective is the same as that used by Lydia of herself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-15.htm" title="And when she was baptized, and her household, she sought us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.">Acts 16:15</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a>, tells us that her name was Eunike, and her mother's Lois. They were both devout, and had trained the child in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm" title="And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.">2Timothy 3:15</a>); and this makes it probable that the father was a proselyte of the gate. He naturally thought it sufficient that his child should grow up under the same religious conditions as himself, and they had either thought so, or had yielded to his will.<p><span class= "bld">His father was a Greek.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of a Greek father.</span> The adjective is used, as in the New Testament generally, to express the fact that he was a heathen. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-26.htm" title="The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she sought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.">Mark 7:26</a>.) It seems, on the whole, probable that he was still living.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- And he came also</span> for <span class="accented">then came he</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">to Lystra</span> for <span class="accented">Lystra</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Timothy</span> for <span class="accented">Timotheus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of a Jewess</span> for <span class="accented">of a certain woman which was a Jewess</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">which</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V. For <span class="cmt_word">Derbe</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Lystra</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14.htm">Acts 14</a>. and notes. This time St. Paul visited Derbe first, whereas before he came from Lystra to Derbe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-6.htm">Acts 14:6, 8, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Was there</span>; viz. at Lystra (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-11.htm">2 Timothy 3:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A certain disciple</span>; i.e. a Christian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>). From St. Paul's speaking of Timothy as "my own sou in the faith" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>), and from his special mention of Timothy's mother Eunice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>), it is probable that both mother and son were converted by St. Paul at his first visit to Lystra, some years before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-7.htm">Acts 14:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Timothy</span>. It is a Greek name, meaning "one who honors God" (formed, like <span class="accented">Timoleon, Timolaus, Timocrates</span>, etc.). It was a not uncommon name, and occurs repeatedly in the Books of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 5:6; 2 Macc. 8:30, etc.). Another form is <span class="accented">Timesitheos.</span> Timothy is uniformly spoken of by St. Paul in terms of eulogy and warm affection (see, besides the passages above quoted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19-22</a>; and the general tone of the Epistles to Timothy). <span class="cmt_word">A Jewess</span>; viz. <span class="accented">Eunice</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>), also a Greek name (equivalent to <span class="accented">Victoria</span>), though borne by a Jewess. <span class="cmt_word">A Greek</span>; i.e. <span class="accented">a</span> Gentile (see Hark 7:26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). Had his father been a proselyte, it would probably have been said that he was (Bengel). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-5 Well may the church look for much service from youthful ministers who set out in the same spirit as Timothy. But when men will submit in nothing, and oblige in nothing, the first elements of the Christian temper seem to be wanting; and there is great reason to believe that the doctrines and precepts of the gospel will not be successfully taught. The design of the decree being to set aside the ceremonial law, and its carnal ordinances, believers were confirmed in the Christian faith, because it set up a spiritual way of serving God, as suited to the nature both of God and man. Thus the church increased in numbers daily.</body></html>
