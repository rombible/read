It should be stated, however, that the Greek noun is used without the article, and that this is so far in favour of the Received rendering. On the other hand, we find the noun <span class= "ital">ecclesia, </span>or <span class= "ital">church, </span>used without the article in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-4.htm" title="He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.">1Corinthians 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-19.htm" title="Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.">1Corinthians 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-35.htm" title="And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.">1Corinthians 14:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-6.htm" title="Which have borne witness of your charity before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:">3John 1:6</a>, and it is, therefore, probable that <span class= "ital">proseucha</span> might be used in the same way, just as we speak of "going to church, or to chapel," without the article. This was probably on the following Sabbath, or possibly after a longer interval, when the mission of the Apostles had become known, and had caused some excitement.<p><span class= "bld">A certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination.</span>--Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">a spirit of Python, </span>or, as some MSS. give it, <span class= "ital">a Python spirit. </span>The Python was the serpent worshipped at Delphi, as the symbol of wisdom, from whom the Pythian priestesses took their name, and from whom Apollo, as succeeding to the oracular power of the serpent, took the same adjective. The fact that St. Luke, who in his Gospel describes like phenomena as coming from <span class= "ital">daemonia, </span>"evil spirits," "unclean spirits," should here use this exceptional description, seems to imply either that this was the way in which the people of Philippi spoke of the maiden, or else that he recognised in her phenomena identical with those of the priestesses of Delphi, the wild distortions, the shrill cries, the madness of an evil inspiration. After the manner of sibyls, and sorceresses, and clairvoyants of other times, the girl, whom Augustine describes as <span class= "ital">faemina ventriloqua</span>--the phrase probably-expressing the peculiar tones characteristic of hysteria--was looked on as having power to divine and predict ("soothsaying," as distinct from "prophesying," exactly expresses the force of the Greek verb), and her wild cries were caught up and received as oracles. Plutarch (<span class= "ital">de Defect. Orac., </span>p. 737) speaks of the name Python as being applied commonly, in his time, to "ventriloquists" of this type. As she was a slave, her masters traded on her supposed inspiration, and made the girl, whom prayer and quiet might have restored to sanity, give answers to those who sought for oracular guidance in the perplexities of their lives.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- Were going to the place of prayer</span> for <span class="accented">went to prayer</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">that a certain maid</span> for <span class="accented">a certain damsel</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">having</span> for <span class="accented">possessed with</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The place of prayer</span>.

It was a name of Apollo in his character of a giver of oracles. Delphi itself, where his chief oracle was, was sometimes called <span class="accented">Pytho</span> (Schleusner, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>), and <span class="accented">Pythius</span> was a common epithet of Apollo. The name Python (Plut.,' De Defect. <span class="accented">Orac.</span>,' cap. 9) came thence to be applied to a ventriloquist (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>), or to the spirit that was conceived to dwell in ventriloquists and to speak by them, just as in Hebrew the ventriloquist was sometimes called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> (or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> if a woman), the owner of a spirit of divination, or simply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, a diviner (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a> (twice) for the first use, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-11.htm">Deuteronomy 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>; for the second). In some passages, as 1 Kings 28:6 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>, it is doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> means the ventriloquist or the spirit. The feminine plural <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>) seems always to denote the women, who, like the damsel in the text, practiced the art of ventriloquistic necromancy, whether really possessed by a spirit or feigning to be so. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is only found here in the New Testament. The LXX. usually render <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Gain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), literally, <span class="accented">work, craft</span>, or <span class="accented">trade</span>; then, by metonymy, <span class="accented">the gain</span> proceeding from such trade (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By soothsaying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>).

Those who do good by drawing men from sin, may expect to be reviled as troublers of the city. While they teach men to fear God, to believe in Christ, to forsake sin, and to live godly lives, they will be accused of teaching bad customs.</body></html>
