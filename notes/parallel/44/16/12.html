The city of Philippi, rebuilt by the father of Alexander the Great, and bearing his name in lieu of Krenides ( = the fountains), was situated on the Gangites, a tributary of the Strymon; but it was not the chief city of any one of the four sub-divisions of the Roman province of Macedonia, that rank being assigned to Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, and Pelagonia. As there is no definite article in the Greek, it is possible that St. Luke simply meant to say it was <span class= "ital">a</span> chief town of the district, the epithet <span class= "ital">Prote</span> ( = first) being often found on the coins of cities which were not capitals. The more probable explanation, however, is that he uses the Greek word translated "part," in the sense of "border-land," as in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-7.htm" title="Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passes out and him that returns.">Ezekiel 35:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-7.htm" title="And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.">Ruth 3:7</a>, and that it was the <span class= "ital">first</span> city of that frontier district, either as the most important or as being the first to which they came in the route by which they travelled. This was precisely the position of Philippi, which, together with Pella and other towns, had been garrisoned by the Romans as outposts against the neighbouring tribes of Thrace. It had been established as a colony by Augustus after the defeat of Brutus and Cassius, and its full title, as seen on the coins of the city, was Colonia Augusta Julia Philippensis.<p><span class= "bld">A colony.</span>--The English reader needs to be reminded that a Roman <span class= "ital">colonia</span> differed from the modern in being essentially a military position. Portions of the conquered territory were commonly assigned to veteran soldiers, and the settlement thus formed was considered politically as an integral part of Rome, all decrees of the emperor or senate being as binding there as in the capital itself. The colonies thus formed were as the "propugnacula imperii" (Cic. <span class= "ital">de leg. Agrar.</span> c. 27), "populi Romani quasi effigies parvae simulacraque" (Aul. Gell. xvi. 13). Here, then, in the first European city to which St. Paul came, there was something like an earnest of his future victories. Himself a Roman citizen, he was brought into direct contact with Romans. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-21.htm" title="And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.">Acts 16:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - A <span class="accented">city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a Roman colony</span> for <span class="accented">the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony</span>, A.V.: <span class="accented">this</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tarrying</span> for <span class="accented">abiding</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A city of Macedonia</span>, etc. This is a difficult sentence. The natural way of construing the words undoubtedly is, as in the A.V., "which is the chief city of the [or, ' that'] district of Macedonia, and a colony." The only difficulty in the way of so taking it is that when AEmilius Paulus, as related by Livy (45:29), divided the conquered kingdom of Macedonia into four districts (<span class="accented">regiones</span> or <span class="accented">partes</span>), Amphi-pelts was made the capital of the district in which Philippi was situated. But the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> does not necessarily mean the capital; it is found on coins applied to cities which were not capitals. Besides, in the interval of above two hundred years between Aemilius Paulus and St. Paul (from s.c. 167 to A.D. ), it is very probable that the city of Philippi, with its gold-mines and its privileges as a colony, may have really become the capital. And so Lewin, following Wetstein, understands it (vol. it. p. 209). We know that in the reign of Theodosius the Younger, when Macedonia was divided into two provinces, Philippi became the ecclesiastical head of Macedonia Prima. It had been made a colony by Augustus Caesar, with the name "Col. Jul. Aug. Philip.," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Colonia Augusta Julia Philippensis ('Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog.'). It must, therefore, anyhow have been a place of first-rate importance at this time. Those, however, who do not accept this explanation, couple <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "which is the first colony-city," etc, Others take <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> in a local sense, "the first city you come to in Macedonia" (Conybeare and Howson, Alford, Bengel, etc.). The R.V. seems to take <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> together, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as a further description of it - a most awkward construction. Alford renders it, "which is the first Macedonian city of the district.' But the natural way of construing a passage is almost always the best, and nothing prevents us from believing that St. Luke, who knew Philippi intimately, was strictly accurate in calling it "the chief city of the district of Macedonia," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the district in which it was situated. That <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is the technical name of the division of a province appears from the title <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, applied by Josephus to a certain Apollonius, governor, under Antiochus Epiphanes, of the district in which Samaria was included ('Ant. Jud.,' 12. 5:5). The ancient name of Philippi was Dates first, then Krenides - the springs, or wells; and the word used by Livy of the districts of Macedonia, <span class="accented">pars prima, secunda</span>, etc., is an exact translation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> It received the name of Philippi, from Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, who extracted a great revenue from its gold-mines. Its great historical celebrity arises from the battle in the plain of Philippi, in which the republican party, under Brutus and Cassius, received its death-blow from Octavius and Antony. (For a full description of Philippi, and of the privileges of a colony, see Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1:311, etc., and Lewin, vol. 1. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11.htm">Acts 11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">This</span>. Alford, following certain manuscripts, reads <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>, "in the city itself," as distinguished from the place outside the city, where the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> was. But, perhaps, St. Luke uses the word "this" from Philippi being the place of his own residence, and where he may have drawn up the narrative on the spot. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:6-15 The removals of ministers, and the dispensing the means of grace by them, are in particular under Divine conduct and direction. We must follow Providence: and whatever we seek to do, if that suffer us not, we ought to submit and believe to be for the best. People greatly need help for their souls, it is their duty to look out for it, and to invite those among them who can help them. And God's calls must be complied with readily. A solemn assembly the worshippers of God must have, if possible, upon the sabbath day. If we have not synagogues, we must be thankful for more private places, and resort to them; not forsaking the assembling together, as our opportunities are. Among the hearers of Paul was a woman, named Lydia. She had an honest calling, which the historian notices to her praise. Yet though she had a calling to mind, she found time to improve advantages for her soul. It will not excuse us from religious duties, to say, We have a trade to mind; for have not we also a God to serve, and souls to look after? Religion does not call us from our business in the world, but directs us in it. Pride, prejudice, and sin shut out the truths of God, till his grace makes way for them into the understanding and affections; and the Lord alone can open the heart to receive and believe his word. We must believe in Jesus Christ; there is no coming to God as a Father, but by the Son as Mediator.</body></html>
