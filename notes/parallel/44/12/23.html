To "give God the glory" was a phrase always connected with the confession of sin and weakness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a>. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm" title="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.">John 9:24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He was eaten of worms.</span>--The specific form of the disease is not named by Josephus, and St. Luke's precision in describing it may fairly be regarded as characteristic of his calling. The form of the disease, probably of the nature of <span class= "ital">phtheiriasis, </span>or the <span class= "ital">morbus pedicularis, </span>from its exceptionally loathsome character, had always been regarded as of the nature of a divine chastisement. The more memorable instances of it recorded in history are those of Pheretimo of Cyrene (Herod. iv. 205), Sylla, Antiochus the Great (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-2.htm" title="For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and went about to rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the multitude running to defend themselves with their weapons put them to flight; and so it happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the inhabitants returned with shame.">2 Maccabees 9:2</a>), Herod the Great (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 8), and Maximinus, among the persecutors of the Church (Euseb. viii. 16; ix. 10, 11; Lactant, <span class= "ital">De mort.

The death of Agrippa took place A.D. 44, in the seventh year of his reign, and at the age of fifty-three.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- An angel</span> for <span class="accented">the angel</span>, A.V.

And such men as Herod, when puffed with pride and vanity, are ripening fast for signal vengeance. God is very jealous for his own honour, and will be glorified upon those whom he is not glorified by. See what vile bodies we carry about with us; they have in them the seeds of their own dissolution, by which they will soon be destroyed, whenever God does but speak the word. We may learn wisdom from the people of Tyre and Sidon, for we have offended the Lord with our sins. We depend on him for life, and breath, and all things; it surely then behoves us to humble ourselves before him, that through the appointed Mediator, who is ever ready to befriend us, we may be reconciled to him, lest wrath come upon us to the utmost.</body></html>
