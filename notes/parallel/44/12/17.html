Many writers have maintained the identity of the person described under these two names; but reasons have been given in the Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm" title="Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-47.htm" title="Then one said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to speak with you.">Matthew 12:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a>, for believing that they were two distinct persons, and that the brother of the Lord was therefore not an Apostle. It is obvious that about this time, probably in consequence of the death of his namesake, the son of Zebedee, James the brother of the Lord comes into a fresh prominence. He is named as receiving St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm" title="But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.">Galatians 1:19</a>, and as being, with Peter and John, one of the pillars of the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>). Probably about this time (but see <span class= "ital">Introduction to the Epistle of St. James</span>) he addressed the letter that bears his name to the Twelve Tribes that were scattered abroad. He presides at the Council of Jerusalem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-13.htm" title="And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brothers, listen to me:">Acts 15:13</a>, and acted as bishop of the Church at Jerusalem. According to the statement of Hegesippus, a Jewish Christian writer of the second century, preserved by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist. ii.</span> 23). he led the life of a Nazarite in all its rigour, was regarded by the Jews as having a priestly character, wore the linen ephod, and the golden petalon or plate, fitting on the brow of the priests, and as such was admitted to the Holy Place in the Temple. In A.D. 62 or 63 he was tempted by the priestly rulers, especially by the high-priest Ananias, to declare that the Christ was a deceiver, and on proclaiming his faith in Him was thrown from the pinnacle of the Temple, and as he lay on the ground, received a <span class= "ital">coup de grace</span> from a fuller's club. The way in which St. Peter here speaks of him implies that he was, in some way, the head and representative of the Christian community at Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">He departed, and went into another place.</span>--The act was in accordance with the precept which had been given to the Twelve in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-23.htm" title="But when they persecute you in this city, flee you into another: for truly I say to you, You shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.">Matthew 10:23</a>. What the "other place" was we can only conjecture. Some Romish writers have hazarded the wild guess that he went to Rome, and having founded the Church there, returned to Jerusalem in time for the council in Acts 15. Others have assumed Antioch, which is, perhaps, less improbable; but there are no traces of his presence there till after the council (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a>). Some nearer city, such as Lydda or Joppa, might, however, have been sufficient as a place of refuge, and the absence of the name of the place suggests the inference that it was comparatively unimportant, and that Peter had carried on no conspicuous work there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Brought him forth</span> for <span class="accented">brought him</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tell</span> for <span class="accented">go show</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Beckoning</span>, etc.; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-40.htm">Acts 21:40</a>). It is the action of one having something to say and bespeaking silence while he says it. <span class="cmt_word">Unto James</span>. This, of course, is the same James as is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a> as "the Lord's brother," and who, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9, 12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-12.htm">Acts 15:12</a> and Acts 21:18, as well as here, appears as occupying a peculiar place in the Church at Jerusalem, viz. as all antiquity testifies, as Bishop of Jerusalem. So Hegesippus, quoted by Eusebius ('Eccl. <span class="accented">Hist.</span>,' <span class="accented">2:</span>23), "James the Lord's brother, called by universal consent the Just, received the government of the Church together with the apostles;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a> he quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that, after the Ascension, Peter, James, and John selected James the Just, the Lord's brother, to be the first Bishop of Jerusalem. And Eusebius gives it as the general testimony of antiquity that James the Just, the Lord's brother, was the first who sat on the episcopal throne of Jerusalem. But who he was exactly is a point much controverted. The three hypotheses are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he was the son of Alphaeus or Clopas and Mary, sister to the blessed Virgin, and therefore our Lord's cousin german, and called his brother by a common Hebrew idiom. According to this theory he was one of the twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-15.htm">Luke 6:15</a>), as he appears to be in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>, though this is not certain (see Bishop Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he was the son of Joseph by his first wife, and so stepbrother to the Lord, which is Eusebius's explanation ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he was in the full sense the Lord's brother, being the son of Joseph and Mary. This is the opinion of Alford (<span class="accented">in lee.</span>), fully argued in the 'Proleg. to the Epistle of James,' and of Meyer, Credner, and many German commentators. According to these two last hypotheses, he was not one of the twelve. "The apostolic constitutions distinguish between James the son of Alphaeus, the apostle, and James the brother of the Lord, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Meyer). It may be added that <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a> separates the brethren of the Lord from the apostles, who are enumerated in the preceding verses. The hypothesis which identifies James the Lord's brother with James the son of Alphaeus or Clopas and Mary is well argued in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. "James" (see also the able Introduction to the Epistle of James in the 'Speaker's Commentary'). It seems impossible to come to a certain conclusion. The weakest point in the hypothesis which identifies James the Lord's brother with the son of Alphaeus is that it fails to account for the distinction clearly made between the Lord's brothers and the apostles in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 5, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46, 49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>. For the effect of these passages is scarcely neutralized by <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>. But then, on the other hand, the hypothesis that the Lord's brethren, including James and Joses, were the children of Joseph and Mary, seems to be flatly contradicted by the mention of Mary the wife of Clopas as being "the mother of James and Jests" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He went to another place</span>. Whether Luke was not informed what the place was, or whether there was some reason why he did not mention it, we cannot tell. The Venerable Bode ('Prolog. in Expos. in Act. Apost.'), Baronius, and other authorities of the Church of Rome, say he went to Rome, and commenced his episcopate of Rome at this time Dr Lightfoot thinks it more probable that he went to Antioch (Comm. on Acts, in vol. 8. pp. 273, 289). Some guess Caesarea; but there is no clue really. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-19 God's providence leaves room for the use of our prudence, though he has undertaken to perform and perfect what he has begun. These Christians continued in prayer for Peter, for they were truly in earnest. Thus men ought always to pray, and not to faint. As long as we are kept waiting for a mercy, we must continue praying for it. But sometimes that which we most earnestly wish for, we are most backward to believe. The Christian law of self-denial and of suffering for Christ, has not done away the natural law of caring for our own safety by lawful means. In times of public danger, all believers have God for their hiding-place; which is so secret, that the world cannot find them. Also, the instruments of persecution are themselves exposed to danger; the wrath of God hangs over all that engage in this hateful work. And the range of persecutors often vents itself on all in its way.</body></html>
