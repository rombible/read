In this solitary instance the translators have introduced, with a singular infelicity, the term which was definitely appropriate only to the Christian festival which took the place of the Passover.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Taken</span> for <span class="accented">apprehended</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">guard</span> for <span class="accented">keep</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Passover</span> for <span class="accented">Easter</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Four quaternions</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> four bands of four soldiers each, which were on guard in succession through the four watches of the night - one quaternion for each watch. <span class="cmt_word">The Passover.</span> This is a decided improve-merit, as the use of the word "Easter" implies that the Christian feast is here meant. But perhaps" Feast of the Passover" would have been better, as showing that the whole seven days are intended. This is, perhaps, the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>, and certainly is its meaning here. We have another characteristic trait of the religion of Agrippa, and of his sympathy with the feelings of the Jews about the Law, that he would not allow a trial on a capital charge, or an execution, to take place during the Feast of Unleavened Bread (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-8.htm">John 18:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bring him forth to the people</span>.

Now the words of Christ were made good in him; and if we suffer with Christ, we shall reign with him. Herod imprisoned Peter: the way of persecution, as of other sins, is downhill; when men are in it, they cannot easily stop. Those make themselves an easy prey to Satan, who make it their business to please men. Thus James finished his course. But Peter, being designed for further services, was safe; though he seemed now marked out for a speedy sacrifice. We that live in a cold, prayerless generation, can hardly form an idea of the earnestness of these holy men of old. But if the Lord should bring on the church an awful persecution like this of Herod, the faithful in Christ would learn what soul-felt prayer is.</body></html>
