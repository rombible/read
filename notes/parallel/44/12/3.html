The persecution did not spring from any fanatic zeal against the new faith, but simply from motives of political expediency. A somewhat touching incident is recorded, illustrating the king's sensitiveness to popular praise or blame. It was at the Feast of Tabernacles, and the Law was read, and he heard the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-15.htm" title="You shall in any wise set him king over you, whom the LORD your God shall choose: one from among your brothers shall you set king over you: you may not set a stranger over you, which is not your brother.">Deuteronomy 17:15</a> : "Thou shalt not set a stranger over thee," and he burst into tears at the thought of his own Idumaean descent. The people saw him weeping, and cried out: "Trouble not thyself, Agrippa; thou also art our brother," and the king's heart was comforted (Jost, <span class= "ital">Gesch. des Judenthums, </span>I., p. 420).<p><span class= "bld">Then were the days of unleavened bread.</span>--The crowds of Hellenistic and other Jews who were gathered to keep the feast at Jerusalem naturally made this a favourable opportunity for courting the favour of the people. A tradition recorded by St. Jerome states that St. James was beheaded on the 15th of Nisan, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>on the same day as that of the Crucifixion. Peter was arrested probably at the same time; but the trial and execution were deferred till the seven days of the feast were over.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- When</span> for <span class="accented">because</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that it pleased</span> for <span class="accented">it pleased</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">proceeded</span> for <span class="accented">proceeded further</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">seize</span> for <span class="accented">take</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">and those</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">He proceeded to</span> <span class="cmt_word">seize</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) is a Hebraism.

Jud.' 19.7.3). <span class="cmt_word">The days of unleavened bread</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as expressed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-1.htm">Luke 22:1</a>, "The Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover." It lasted seven days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15-18</a>), from the 14th to the 21st of Nisan, or Abib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-18.htm">Exodus 12:18-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-4</a>), the Passover being eaten on the night of the 14th. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-5 James was one of the sons of Zebedee, whom Christ told that they should drink of the cup that he was to drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that he was to be baptized with, Mt 20:23. Now the words of Christ were made good in him; and if we suffer with Christ, we shall reign with him. Herod imprisoned Peter: the way of persecution, as of other sins, is downhill; when men are in it, they cannot easily stop. Those make themselves an easy prey to Satan, who make it their business to please men. Thus James finished his course. But Peter, being designed for further services, was safe; though he seemed now marked out for a speedy sacrifice. We that live in a cold, prayerless generation, can hardly form an idea of the earnestness of these holy men of old. But if the Lord should bring on the church an awful persecution like this of Herod, the faithful in Christ would learn what soul-felt prayer is.</body></html>
