And this infinitive absolute is continued in the following clauses, giving remarkable force to the words, and expressing an habitual result. We see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15-17</a> that these unfruitful seasons had visited them during all the continuance of their negligence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But ye have not enough.</span> The food which they ate did not satisfy them; their bodies were sickly and derived no strength from the food which they took (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a>) or from the wine which they drank (see note on Micah 6:14). <span class="cmt_word">But there is none warm.</span> Perhaps the winters were unusually rigorous, or their infirm health made their usual clothing insufficient to maintain their bodily heat.

Those employed for God may be driven from their work by a storm, yet they must go back to it. They did not say that they would not build a temple, but, Not yet. Thus men do not say they will never repent and reform, and be religious, but, Not yet. And so the great business we were sent into the world to do, is not done. There is a proneness in us to think wrongly of discouragements in our duty, as if they were a discharge from our duty, when they are only for the trial of our courage and faith. They neglected the building of God's house, that they might have more time and money for worldly affairs. That the punishment might answer to the sin, the poverty they thought to prevent by not building the temple, God brought upon them for not building it. Many good works have been intended, but not done, because men supposed the proper time was not come. Thus believers let slip opportunities of usefulness, and sinners delay the concerns of their souls, till too late. If we labour only for the meat that perishes, as the Jews here, we are in danger of losing our labour; but we are sure it shall not be in vain in the Lord, if we labour for the meat which lasts to eternal life. If we would have the comfort and continuance of temporal enjoyments, we must have God as our Friend. See also Lu 12:33. When God crosses our temporal affairs, and we meet with trouble and disappointment, we shall find the cause is, that the work we have to do for God and our own souls is left undone, and we seek our own things more than the things of Christ. How many, who plead that they cannot afford to give to pious or charitable designs, often lavish ten times as much in needless expenses on their houses and themselves! But those are strangers to their own interests, who are full of care to adorn and enrich their own houses, while God's temple in their hearts lies waste. It is the great concern of every one, to apply to the necessary duty of self-examination and communion with our own hearts concerning our spiritual state. Sin is what we must answer for; duty is what we must do. But many are quick-sighted to pry into other people's ways, who are careless of their own. If any duty has been neglected, that is no reason why it should still be so. Whatever God will take pleasure in when done, we ought to take pleasure in doing. Let those who have put off their return to God, return with all their heart, while there is time.</body></html>
