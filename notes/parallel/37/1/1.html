Prophecy is now dated by the years of a foreign ruler, for Zerubbabel, though a lineal descendant of David, was only a <span class= "ital">pechah,</span> or viceroy of Persian appointment, not a king in his own right.<p><span class= "bld">The sixth month.</span>--That named Elul, corresponding nearly with our September.<p><span class= "bld">In the first day</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, on the festival of the new moon, a holy day which had always been marked not only by suspension of labour, but by special services in the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-3.htm" title="Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.">Ezekiel 46:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-23.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, said the LORD.">Isaiah 66:23</a>). It was thus an appropriate occasion for Haggai to commence a series of exhortations so intimately connected with the Temple. Besides, it appears to have been an ancient custom that the people should resort to the prophets for religious instruction on new moons and Sabbaths. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm" title="And he said, Why will you go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath.

Joshua, the high priest, is a prominent character in the prophecy of Zechariah. Haggai addresses Zerubbabel as the civil, Joshua as the ecclesiastical head of the restored exiles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the second year of Darius the king.</span> This is Darius Hystaspes, who reigned over Persia from <span class="date">B.C. 521</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 486</span>. He is called in the inscriptions <span class="accented">Daryavush</span>, which name means "Holder," or "Supporter." Herodotus (6:98) explains it as "Coercer" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). Hitherto the prophets have dated the time of the exercise of their office from the reigns of the legitimate Hebrew monarchs; it shows a new slate of things when they place at the head of their oracles the name of a foreign and a heathen patenlate. The Jews had, indeed, now no king of their own, "the tabernacle of David had fallen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>), and they were living on sufferance under an alien power. They had returned from exile by permission of Cyrus in the first year of his occupancy of the throne of Babylon sixteen years before this time, and had commenced to build the temple soon after; but the opposition of neighbours, contradictory orders from the Persian court, and their own lukewarmness had contributed to hinder the work, and it soon wholly ceased, and remained suspended to the moment when Haggai, as the seventy years of desolation drew to an end, was commissioned to arouse them from their apathy, and to urge them to use the opportunity which was afforded by the accession of the new monarch and the withdrawal of the vexatious interdict that had checked their operations in the previous reign (see Introduction, &sect; 1; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-24.htm">Ezra 4:24</a>).

This would be Elul, answering to parts of our August and September. <span class="cmt_word">In the first day.</span> This was the regular festival of the new moon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>), and a fitting time to urge the building of the temple, without which it could not be duly celebrated. <span class="cmt_word">By</span>; literally, <span class="accented">by the hand</span> (as in ver. 3), the instrument whom God used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-35.htm">Exodus 9:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-35.htm">Acts 7:35</a>) <span class="cmt_word">Haggai the prophet</span> (see the Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>, "Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel." The temporal head of the nation, the representative of the royal house of David, and therefore with the high priest jointly responsible, for the present state of affairs, and having power and authority to amend it. The name, as explained, and rightly, by St. Jerome, means, "Born in Babylon," and intimates the truth concerning his origin. He is called Sheshbazzar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-8.htm">Ezra 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>, which is either his name at the Persian court, or is an erroneous transliteration for a synonymous word (see Kuabenbauer, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The name is found in the cuneiform inscription, as <span class="accented">Zir-Babilu.</span> Shealtiel (or Salathiel) means, "Asked of God." There is a difficulty about Zerubbabel's parentage. Here and frequently in this book, and in Ezra and Nehemiah, as well as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>, he is called "son of Shealtiel;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a> he is said to be the son of Pedaiah the brother of Salathiel. The truth probably is that he was by birth the son of Pedaiah, but by adoption or the law of the <span class="accented">levirate</span>, the son of Salathiel. He was regarded as the grandson of Jehoiachin, or Jeconiah. <span class="cmt_word">Governor</span> (<span class="accented">pechah</span>). A foreign word, used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>, in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>) and frequently in Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, to denote an inferior satrap or subordinate governor. Strassmaier (<span class="accented">ap.</span> Knabenbauer) notes that in Assyrian the word is found in the form <span class="accented">pachu</span>, that <span class="accented">pichatu</span> means "a province," <span class="accented">pachat</span>, "a district." It seems natural, though probably erroneous, to connect it with the Turkish pashah. But see the discussion on the word in Pusey, 'Daniel the Prophet,' p. 566, etc. Instead of "Governor of Judah," the LXX. here and ver. 12 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-2.htm">Haggai 2:2</a> reads, "of the tribe of Judah." One of the house of David has the government, but the foreign title applied to him shows that he holds authority only as the deputy of an alien power. Judah was henceforward applied to the whole country. The prophecy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> still held good. <span class="cmt_word">Joshua</span>. The highest spiritual officer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-3.htm">Ezra 4:3</a>). This Joshua, Jehoshua, Jeshua, as he is variously called, was a son of Josedech who, in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, had been carried captive to Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15</a>), and grandson of that Seraiah who, with other princes of Judah, was slain at Riblah by the Babyloniaes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, etc.). The parentage of Zerubbabel and Joshua is specially mentioned to show that the former was of the house of David and the latter of the family of Aaron, and that even in its depressed condition Israel retained its rightful constitution (see note on Zechariah 3:1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Observe the sin of the Jews, after their return from captivity in Babylon. Those employed for God may be driven from their work by a storm, yet they must go back to it. They did not say that they would not build a temple, but, Not yet. Thus men do not say they will never repent and reform, and be religious, but, Not yet. And so the great business we were sent into the world to do, is not done. There is a proneness in us to think wrongly of discouragements in our duty, as if they were a discharge from our duty, when they are only for the trial of our courage and faith. They neglected the building of God's house, that they might have more time and money for worldly affairs. That the punishment might answer to the sin, the poverty they thought to prevent by not building the temple, God brought upon them for not building it. Many good works have been intended, but not done, because men supposed the proper time was not come. Thus believers let slip opportunities of usefulness, and sinners delay the concerns of their souls, till too late. If we labour only for the meat that perishes, as the Jews here, we are in danger of losing our labour; but we are sure it shall not be in vain in the Lord, if we labour for the meat which lasts to eternal life. If we would have the comfort and continuance of temporal enjoyments, we must have God as our Friend. See also Lu 12:33. When God crosses our temporal affairs, and we meet with trouble and disappointment, we shall find the cause is, that the work we have to do for God and our own souls is left undone, and we seek our own things more than the things of Christ. How many, who plead that they cannot afford to give to pious or charitable designs, often lavish ten times as much in needless expenses on their houses and themselves! But those are strangers to their own interests, who are full of care to adorn and enrich their own houses, while God's temple in their hearts lies waste. It is the great concern of every one, to apply to the necessary duty of self-examination and communion with our own hearts concerning our spiritual state. Sin is what we must answer for; duty is what we must do. But many are quick-sighted to pry into other people's ways, who are careless of their own. If any duty has been neglected, that is no reason why it should still be so. Whatever God will take pleasure in when done, we ought to take pleasure in doing. Let those who have put off their return to God, return with all their heart, while there is time.</body></html>
