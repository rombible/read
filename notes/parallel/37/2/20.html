The heathen powers shall be consumed one of another, but the line of Zerubbabel shall stand secure, and be a witness to Jehovah's faithfulness. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/haggai/2-6.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;">Haggai 2:6-9</a>, the only satisfactory interpretation is that Haggai was charged with a prediction--purposely vague and indistinct in character--of the extension of God's kingdom by the Christian dispensation. "Zerubbabel," the descendant of David, includes in himself Him who was according to the flesh his lineal descendant. Just in the same way in older prophecy "David" is himself identified with that Messiah in whom the glories of the Davidic house were to culminate. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm" title="Then you spoke in vision to your holy one, and said, I have laid help on one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.">Psalm 89:19</a>, and comp. Jennings and Lowe, <span class= "ital">Commentary,</span> Introd. to Psalms 89) It appears as unnecessary to find a literal fulfilment of the prediction of the overthrow of the world-powers, "every one by the sword of his brother," as of the utterance (repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;">Haggai 2:6</a>), "I will shake the heavens and the earth." It is true that the empires of Babylon, Persia, Syria, and Greece each in its turn declined and passed away. But in the Roman Empire the world-power was as strongly represented as ever, when Christ came on earth. It was to succumb later on to moral, not to material force. Nothing, in fact, can be extracted from these passages beyond a dim presage of the heathen kingdoms being pervaded by the moral influence of the Christian Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - Part V. THE FOURTH ADDRESS: PROMISE OF THE RESTORATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID, WHEN THE STORM BURSTS ON THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Temporal blessings had been promised to the people generally; now spiritual blessings are announced to Zerubbabel as the head of the nation and the representative of the house of David. <span class="cmt_word">And again;</span> <span class="accented">and a second time</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Septuagint). This revelation took place on the same day as the preceding one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:20-23 The Lord will preserve Zerubbabel and the people of Judah, amidst their enemies. Here is also foretold the establishment and continuance of the kingdom of Christ; by union with whom his people are sealed with the Holy Ghost, sealed with his image, thus distinguished from all others. Here also is foretold the changes, even to that time when the kingdom of Christ shall overthrow and occupy the place of all the empires which opposed his cause. The promise has special reference to Christ, who descended from Zerubbabel in a direct line, and is the sole Builder of the gospel temple. Our Lord Jesus is the Signet on God's right hand, for all power is given to him, and derived from him. By him, and in him, all the promises of God are yea and amen. Whatever changes take place on earth, all will promote the comfort, honour, and happiness of his servants.</body></html>
