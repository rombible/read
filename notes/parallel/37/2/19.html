LXX., <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, "If it shall be known upon the threshing floor." Jerome must have read <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, as he renders, "Si ultra cognoscetur super terram area." He expounds it thus: So abundant shall be the produce that the threshing floor shall not recognize its own corn. or that the threshers shall be forced to join floor to floor to make room for all the grain, "et arearnm separatio nesciatur in terra" Yea, as yet; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">et adhuc</span> (Vulgate); as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-26.htm">Judges 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18</a>. Others translate, "as regards." Though there was no sign of leaf or fruit on the trees, nothing by which one could judge of the future produce, yet the prophet predicts an abundant crop, dating from the people's obedience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2</a>, etc.). From this day will I bless you. "This day" is the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month (ver. 10). From now the improvement in the season should begin and make itself evident. "Bless" is a term often used for sending fruitful seasons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-8.htm">Deuteronomy 28:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-19 Many spoiled this good work, by going about it with unholy hearts and hands, and were likely to gain no advantage by it. The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.</body></html>
