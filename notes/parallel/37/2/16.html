The word <span class="accented">purah</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a> to signify the press itself, hence the Authorized Version so translates it here, inserting "out of," and supplying "vessels," as "measures" above; but it probably here denotes a liquid measure in which the wine was drown. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span> (equivalent to Hebrew <span class="accented">baths</span>). Jerome, <span class="accented">lagenas</span>; and in his commentary, <span class="accented">amphoras.</span> They came and examined the grapes and expected fifty <span class="accented">purahs</span>, "press measures," but they did not get even half that they had hoped. <span class="cmt_word">There were but twenty.</span> Knabenbauer suggests that the meaning may be - looking at the crop of grapes, they expected to draw out, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> empty (<span class="accented">chasaph</span>), the press fifty times, but were egregiously deceived. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-19 Many spoiled this good work, by going about it with unholy hearts and hands, and were likely to gain no advantage by it. The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.</body></html>
