The Temple had been founded fifteen years before, in the second month of the second year of Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm" title="And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.">Ezra 3:10</a>). The work of building had been carried on intermittently till within two years of the present time. It had then been entirely suspended, and had only been actively taken in hand after Haggai's address in the sixth month of this year. The force of the passage is sufficiently plain if we render as above. "In order to make the blessings to be announced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-19.htm" title="Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.">Haggai 2:19</a> appear in strong contrast to the distress pictured in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/haggai/2-16.htm" title="Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the fat press for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.">Haggai 2:16-17</a>, the prophet repeats the injunction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm" title="And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of the LORD:">Haggai 2:15</a>, but with a larger range of retrospect. The whole period back to the time when the foundation of the Temple was laid in the reign of Cyrus was more or less one of distress on account of the unfaithfulness of the people; for between that time and the present all the efforts that had been made to complete the work were spasmodic and feeble" (McCurdy). The rendering "even to the day" is quite allowable, though the construction is certainly rare.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">On their obedience the blessings of nature shall again be theirs.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Consider now from this day and upward</span> (see note on ver. 15.) For "upward" Jerome has here <span class="accented">in futurum</span>, though he translated the same word <span class="accented">supra</span> in ver. 15. Such a rendering is allowable, and affords a good sense, the prophet directing the people's attention to the happy prospect in the future announced in ver. 19. But it seems, best to keep to the same interpretation in two passages so closely allied. The prophet bids the people consider the period from the present, <span class="cmt_word">the four and twentieth day of the ninth month</span>, when this prophecy was uttered (ver. 10), to the other limit explanatory of the term "upward" or "backward." <span class="cmt_word">Even from the day that the foundation,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">since the day that</span>, etc. This is obviously the same period as that named in ver. 15, after the foundation was completed, but before "stone was laid upon stone" of the superstructure (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-9.htm">Zechariah 8:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-19 Many spoiled this good work, by going about it with unholy hearts and hands, and were likely to gain no advantage by it. The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.</body></html>
