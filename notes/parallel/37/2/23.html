<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a>; Keil). <span class="cmt_word">My servant.</span> An honourable title used especially of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>, etc.;

Among Orientals the signet ring was an article of great importance and value (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>; and 'Dict. of the Bible,' art. "Seal"). The allusion is particularly appropriate here, because Zerubbabel is set at the head of the nation in the place of his grandfather (?) Jeconiah, whose rejection from the monarchy had been couched in these terms: "As I live, saith the Lord, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim King of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>). The Son of Sirach, in his praise of great men, refers to this premise," How shall we magnify Zorobabel? even he was as a signet on the right hand" (Ecclus. 49:11). The signet, too, is the sign of authority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-10.htm">Esther 3:10</a>); so Zerubbabel has authority delegated to him from God, the type of him who said, "All things are delivered unto me of my Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>). "The true Zerubbabel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christ, the Son and Antitype of Zerubbabel, is the signet in the hand of the Father, both passively and actively, whereby God impresses his own majesty, thought, and words, and his own image, on men, angels, and all creatures" (Corn. a Lapide <span class="accented">ap.</span> Pusey). <span class="cmt_word">I have chosen thee.</span> This is not a personal assurance only to Zerubbabel, for neither he nor his natural seed reigned in Jerusalem, or rose to any special eminence in the kingdoms of this world. The fulfilment must be looked for in his spiritual progeny and in Christ. Promises are often made in Scripture to individuals which are accomplished only in their descendants; witness those made to Abraham and the other patriarchs, the prophecies of Jacob to his sons, and many others of a similar nature in the Old Testament, Those large promises made to David in old time, that his seed should endure forever, that hie throne should be as the sun before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), were now passed on to Zerubbabel and to his line, because of him was to spring Messiah, in whom alone these wide predictions find their fulfilment, "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32, 33</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:20-23 The Lord will preserve Zerubbabel and the people of Judah, amidst their enemies. Here is also foretold the establishment and continuance of the kingdom of Christ; by union with whom his people are sealed with the Holy Ghost, sealed with his image, thus distinguished from all others. Here also is foretold the changes, even to that time when the kingdom of Christ shall overthrow and occupy the place of all the empires which opposed his cause. The promise has special reference to Christ, who descended from Zerubbabel in a direct line, and is the sole Builder of the gospel temple. Our Lord Jesus is the Signet on God's right hand, for all power is given to him, and derived from him. By him, and in him, all the promises of God are yea and amen. Whatever changes take place on earth, all will promote the comfort, honour, and happiness of his servants.</body></html>
