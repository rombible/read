Jehovah is present with them, and so is His Promise made by solemn covenant in the days of old.<p><span class= "bld">So my spirit.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and my spirit.</span> Besides such promises of God's abiding favour as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-45.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.">Exodus 29:45-46</a>, they have among them the abiding presence of His Holy Spirit. Having these, let them not be afraid. The evidence of the Divine Presence was the mission of inspired prophets, such as Haggai and Zechariah, and the Targum and the Rabbis are perhaps right in referring the words "and my spirit" exclusively to the "spirit of <span class= "ital">prophecy.</span>" It may be noticed that the later Jews held that the Holy Spirit left the Church after the deaths of Zechariah and Malachi.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to the word that I covenanted.</span> The Hebrew is simply, "the word that I," etc. Hence some have connected it with the verb "do" in the preceding verse, the intervening words being parenthetical. But there is intended no injunction respecting the observation of the old covenant, but a consolatory message under present despondency. Others take it with the verb that fallows: "the word and my Spirit remain among you." but it is best to leave the clause in the abrupt fashion in which it is introduced: "(Here is, here stands) the word that I covenanted with you." If anything is supplied, we might insert, "I will confirm." The promise of present help is confirmed by the remembrance of God's former covenant with Israel, that they should be his peculiar people and possess the right of access to him and a claim on his help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45, 46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>). This clause is entirely omitted by the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">So my Spirit remaineth among you;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">and my Spirit abode among you.</span> But the clause refers to God's presence among them now, which was shown by the revelations made to the prophets, as Haggai and Zechariah, and which exhibits itself in his providential ordering of events, the removal of obstacles, the furthering of the good work. Wordsworth notes that "Christ was with the ancient Church in the wilderness (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-9.htm">1 Corinthians 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>); and now, when the eternal <span class="accented">Word</span> became incarnate, and when the <span class="accented">Holy Spirit</span> was sent to be <span class="accented">in the midst</span> of God's faithful people, then this prophecy was fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">Fear ye not.</span> If God be for us, who can be against us?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who are hearty in the Lord's service shall receive encouragement to proceed. But they could not build such a temple then, as Solomon built. Though our gracious God is pleased if we do as well as we can in his service, yet our proud hearts will scarcely let us be pleased, unless we do as well as others, whose abilities are far beyond ours. Encouragement is given the Jews to go on in the work notwithstanding. They have God with them, his Spirit and his special presence. Though he chastens their transgressions, his faithfulness does not fail. The Spirit still remained among them. And they shall have the Messiah among them shortly; He that should come. Convulsions and changes would take place in the Jewish church and state, but first should come great revolutions and commotions among the nations. He shall come, as the Desire of all nations; desirable to all nations, for in him shall all the earth be blessed with the best of blessings; long expected and desired by all believers. The house they were building should be filled with glory, very far beyond Solomon's temple. This house shall be filled with glory of another nature. If we have silver and gold, we must serve and honour God with it, for the property is his. If we have not silver and gold, we must honour him with such as we have, and he will accept us. Let them be comforted that the glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, in what would be beyond all the glories of the first house, the presence of the Messiah, the Son of God, the Lord of glory, personally, and in human nature. Nothing but the presence of the Son of God, in human form and nature, could fulfil this. Jesus is the Christ, is He that should come, and we are to look for no other. This prophecy alone is enough to silence the Jews, and condemn their obstinate rejection of Him, concerning whom all their prophets spake. If God be with us, peace is with us. But the Jews under the latter temple had much trouble; but this promise is fulfilled in that spiritual peace which Jesus Christ has by his blood purchased for all believers. All changes shall make way for Christ to be desired and valued by all nations. And the Jews shall have their eyes opened to behold how precious He is, whom they have hitherto rejected.</body></html>
