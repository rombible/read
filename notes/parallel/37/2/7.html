So apparently the LXX., <span class= "greekheb">???? ?? ??????? ?????? ??? ?????</span><span class= "ital">.</span> The rendering of the Authorised Version, which is based on Jerome's <span class= "ital">et venit desideratus cunctis gentibus,</span> is grammatically impossible with the present text, for the verb "come" is plural, not singular. Its retention in some of the modern commentaries is mainly attributable to a natural unwillingness to give up a direct Messianic prophecy. Apart, however, from the grammatical difficulty, it must be remarked that the Messiah was not longed for by all nations, and that if He had been there would be no point in mentioning the fact in the present connection. On the other hand, the prediction of Gentile offerings to the Temple is most appropriate. It is the answer to those who sorrowed when they contrasted the mean appearance of this present house with the glories of that built by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-3.htm" title="Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?">Haggai 2:3</a>). It also explains the otherwise meaningless utterance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-8.htm" title="The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:8</a>. Another possible rendering is that adopted by Frst, and (at one time) by Ewald, "And the pick of the nations shall come," <span class= "ital">scil.,</span> with offerings to the Temple. The significance of the utterance is the same with either translation--<span class= "ital">scil.,</span> that by agencies not specified the Gentile world is to be converted and induced to offer worship and homage to Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All nations</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>, where our Lord refers to the end of this world).

The faith in the power of national gods was everywhere weakened, and men were prepared to receive the new revelation of one Supreme Deity, who came on earth to teach and save. Now is mentioned the object or consequence of this shaking of nations. <span class="cmt_word">The desire of all nations shall come.</span> This is the rendering of the ancient Jewish expositors, the Chaldee Targum, and the Vulgate, which gives, <span class="accented">Veniet desideratus cunctis gentibus.</span> Tile words in this case point to a person, and this person can be no one else than the Messiaih for whom "all nations consciously or unconsciously yearn, in whom alone all the longings of the human heart find satisfaction" (Perowne). But there is difficulty in accepting this view. The word rendered "the desire" (<span class="accented">chemdath</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> singular, the verb "shall come" (<span class="accented">bau</span>) is plural, as if it was said in Latin, <span class="accented">Venient desiderium omnium gentium.</span> The LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "The choice things [or, 'portions'] of all the nations shall come." The plural verb seems fatal to the idea of a person being spoken of; nor is this objection answered by Dr. Pusey's allegation that the object of desire contains in itself many objects of desire, or Bishop Wordsworth's refinement, that Messiah is regarded as a collective Being, containing in his own Person the natures of God and man, and combining the three offices of Prophet, Priest, and King. Every one must see that both these explanations are forced and unnatural, and are conformed rather to theological considerations than to grammatical accuracy. <span class="accented">Chemdah</span> is used for "the object of desire," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a>, where it refers to Hezekiah's treasures, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>, "the goodly vessels" of the temple (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-9.htm">Nahum 2:9</a>). Nowhere is any intimation given that it is a name applied to the Messiah; nowhere is any such explanation offered of the term so applied. The word is a common one; its meaning is well ascertained; and it could hardly have been understood in any but its usual acceptation without some preparation or further definition. This acceptation is confirmed by the mention of "the gold and silver" in ver. 8. The Revised Version cuts the knot by rendering, "the desirable things;" Perowne affirms that the plural verb denotes the manifoldness and variety of the gifts. This seems scarcely satisfactory. May it not be, as Knabenbauer suggests, that "the desire of all nations" forms one notion, in which the words, "all nations," have a predominating influence, and so the plural ensues by <span class="accented">constructio ad sensum?</span> The meaning, then, is that all nations with their wealth come, that the Gentiles shall devote their treasures, their powers, whatever they most highly prize, to the service of God. This is what is predicted elsewhere (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5-7, 11, 13</a>, 17), and it is called, metaphorically, coming with treasures to the temple. To hear of such a glorious future might well be a topic of consolation to the depressed Israelites. (For a further development of the same idea, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24, 26</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">I will fill this house with glory.</span> There is a verbal allusion to the glory which filled Solomon's temple at the dedication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>), but the especial mode in which it is to be manifested in this case is not here mentioned. The previous clause would make the reference rather to the material offerings of the Gentiles, but a further and a deeper signification is connected with the advent of Messiah (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>), with which the complete fulfilment commenced. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who are hearty in the Lord's service shall receive encouragement to proceed. But they could not build such a temple then, as Solomon built. Though our gracious God is pleased if we do as well as we can in his service, yet our proud hearts will scarcely let us be pleased, unless we do as well as others, whose abilities are far beyond ours. Encouragement is given the Jews to go on in the work notwithstanding. They have God with them, his Spirit and his special presence. Though he chastens their transgressions, his faithfulness does not fail. The Spirit still remained among them. And they shall have the Messiah among them shortly; He that should come. Convulsions and changes would take place in the Jewish church and state, but first should come great revolutions and commotions among the nations. He shall come, as the Desire of all nations; desirable to all nations, for in him shall all the earth be blessed with the best of blessings; long expected and desired by all believers. The house they were building should be filled with glory, very far beyond Solomon's temple. This house shall be filled with glory of another nature. If we have silver and gold, we must serve and honour God with it, for the property is his. If we have not silver and gold, we must honour him with such as we have, and he will accept us. Let them be comforted that the glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, in what would be beyond all the glories of the first house, the presence of the Messiah, the Son of God, the Lord of glory, personally, and in human nature. Nothing but the presence of the Son of God, in human form and nature, could fulfil this. Jesus is the Christ, is He that should come, and we are to look for no other. This prophecy alone is enough to silence the Jews, and condemn their obstinate rejection of Him, concerning whom all their prophets spake. If God be with us, peace is with us. But the Jews under the latter temple had much trouble; but this promise is fulfilled in that spiritual peace which Jesus Christ has by his blood purchased for all believers. All changes shall make way for Christ to be desired and valued by all nations. And the Jews shall have their eyes opened to behold how precious He is, whom they have hitherto rejected.</body></html>
