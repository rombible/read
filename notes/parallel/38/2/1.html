This third vision makes a further revelation of God's mercy to Israel. Consequent on the destruction of enemies shall be the growth and development of the chosen people till the time of their final glory (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>). There is some difficulty in arranging the details of this vision, depending in great measure on the decision we arrive at with regard to the identification of the "young man" of ver. 4. Those who, as Theodoret, Hitzig, Schegg, Trcehon, Wright, Perowne, etc., consider him to be the man with the measuring line of ver. 1, do not explain why the message should be given to him instead of to the prophet who had asked for information. Nor is it at all certain that the measurer is meant to be regarded as having made a mistake in attempting to define the limits of what was practically unlimited - viz. the restored Jerusalem - and was stopped accordingly in his proceedings. It seems preferable, with Jerome, Cornelius a Lapide, Pusey, Keil, Knabenbauer, etc., to regard the "young man" as Zechariah himself. Then the vision is thus presented: The prophet sees a man with a measuring line; he asks whither he is going, and is answered that he was going forth to measure Jerusalem. Upon this the interpreting angel leaves the prophet's side to receive the explanation of the man's proceedings, and is met by a superior angel, who bids him hasten to tell the prophet the meaning of the vision. <span class="cmt_word">A man.</span> Probably an angel in human form, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A measuring line.</span> This is not the same word as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; but the idea there proposed is taken up here, and its fulfilment is set forth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15, 16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 The Son of David, even the Man Christ Jesus, whom the prophet sees with a measuring line in his hand, is the Master-Builder of his church. God notices the extent of his church, and will take care that whatever number of guests are brought to the wedding-supper, there shall be room. This vision means well to Jerusalem. The walls of a city, as they defend it, so they straiten its inhabitants; but Jerusalem shall be extended as freely as if it had no walls at all, yet shall be as safe as if it had the strongest walls. In the church of God there yet is room for other multitudes, more than man can number. None shall be refused who trust in Christ; and He never shuts out from heaven one true member of the church on earth. God will be a Wall of fire round them, which can neither be broken through nor undermined, nor can it be assailed without danger to those who attack. This vision was to have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, which is extended by admitting the Gentiles into it; and which has the Son of God for its Prince and Protector; especially in the glorious times yet to come.</body></html>
