He was to hasten and deliver the message, because it was a joyful one and calculated to allay the prophet's solicitude. <span class="cmt_word">This young man.</span> The Prophet Zechariah. The term applied to him is thought to show that he was still young when the vision appeared; but the word is used also for minister, or servant, or disciple, without necessarily defining the age. Others, not so suitably, consider that the measuring angel is meant, who is thus stopped in his intention of measuring Jerusalem, as being ignorant of God's counsels. <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls.</span> Jerusalem shall be as open villages in a plain country. The word <span class="accented">perazoth</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>, meaning "unwalled villages" where men dwelt "without walls, having neither bars nor gates." So <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-19.htm">Esther 9:19</a>, where it means, "country towns," in contrast to the metropolis, which was walled and fortified. The idea in the text is that Jerusalem in the future shall be so extended that walls shall no longer contain its inhabitants, but they shall spread themselves in the open country on every side. It is certain that the city did greatly increase in after time, if we may believe Aristeas's account in his famous letter to his brother Philocrates; and the annunciation of this prosperity would be a comfort to the prophet (comp. Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:04, 2). But no material increase of this nature satisfies the prophecy, which can only have its fulfilment in the spiritual Jerusalem, whose Builder is Christ, in whose light the nations of them that are saved shall walk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>, etc.; Isaiah 54:2, 3). This open condition implies not only extent, but peace and safety also. The reason of this quiet security is given in the next verse. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;</span>, "Jerusalem shall be abundantly inhabited." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 The Son of David, even the Man Christ Jesus, whom the prophet sees with a measuring line in his hand, is the Master-Builder of his church. God notices the extent of his church, and will take care that whatever number of guests are brought to the wedding-supper, there shall be room. This vision means well to Jerusalem. The walls of a city, as they defend it, so they straiten its inhabitants; but Jerusalem shall be extended as freely as if it had no walls at all, yet shall be as safe as if it had the strongest walls. In the church of God there yet is room for other multitudes, more than man can number. None shall be refused who trust in Christ; and He never shuts out from heaven one true member of the church on earth. God will be a Wall of fire round them, which can neither be broken through nor undermined, nor can it be assailed without danger to those who attack. This vision was to have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, which is extended by admitting the Gentiles into it; and which has the Son of God for its Prince and Protector; especially in the glorious times yet to come.</body></html>
