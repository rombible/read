As the words, "thus saith the Lord," precede, we should have expected, "have I sent thee," but such change of persons, and indirect address, are common in Hebrew (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>). The angel is sent to get glory over the heathen by taking vengeance on them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-18.htm">Exodus 14:18</a>). Such judgments are often represented to be inflicted by angelic agency (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-13.htm">Genesis 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9.htm">Ezekiel 9</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The apple of his eye.</span> The language is human. Israel is very precious to God; and they who vex and harass him are as they who hurt that which God prizes inestimably, and which a mere touch offends and injures. The word rendered "apple" is usually considered in mean "aperture," or "gate," the pupil being the entrance to the visual organ; but Dr. Wright regards it rather as a natural word of endearment, like the Latin, <span class="accented">pupa, pupilla</span>, indicating "a doll," "little maiden of the eye." Similar, though not identical, expressions occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-2.htm">Proverbs 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-9 If God will build Jerusalem for the people and their comfort, they must inhabit it for him and his glory. The promises and privileges with which God's people are blessed, should engage us to join them, whatever it costs us. When Zion is enlarged to make room for all God's Israel, it is the greatest madness for any of them to stay in Babylon. The captivity of a sinful state is by no means to be continued in, though a man may be easy in worldly matters. Escape for thy life, look not behind thee. Christ has proclaimed that deliverance to the captives, which he has himself wrought out, and it concerns every one to resolve that sin shall not have dominion over him. Those who would be found among God's children, must save themselves from this world, see Ac 2:40. What Christ will do for his church, shall be an evident proof of God's care and affection. He that touches you, touches the apple of his eye. This is a strong expression of God's love to his church. He takes what is done against her as done against the tenderest part of the eye, to which the least touch is a great offence. Christ is sent to be the Protector of his church.</body></html>
