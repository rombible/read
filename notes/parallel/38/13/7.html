4<span class="accented">. For the smiting of the good Shepherd Israel is punished, passes through much tribulation, by which it is refined, and in the end</span> (<span class="accented">though reduced to a mere</span> <span class="accented">remnant</span>) <span class="accented">is saved</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, O sword.</span> Zechariah proceeds to show the course of the purification of the people. The mention of the false prophet and the shameful wounds in his flesh leads him to the contrast of the true Prophet and the effects of his "piercing." The abruptness of the commencement of the verse is dramatic, and gives no sufficient cause for supposing that this paragraph ought to be transferred (as Ewald and others desire) to the end of ch. 11. (For a similar apostrophe, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>.) It is introduced here to show that all that happened to the Shepherd was done after the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God; and as if the sword could never have dared to act thus except it were permitted by the Divine will. The "sword" represents any kind of instrument that inflicts death (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-9.htm">2 Samuel 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My Shepherd.</span> The Shepherd of Jehovah, who is speaking. He is the good Shepherd, the Representative of Jehovah, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-4.htm">Zechariah 11:4</a>, etc., the Messiah, who is identified with Jehovah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>. The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "my shepherds" (Vatican), as if no particular person was indicated, but rather all the leaders of the people of God; but the next clause seems to render the reference definite. <span class="cmt_word">The man that is my fellow.</span> The word rendered "man" means rather "mighty man;" that rendered "fellow" occurs often in Leviticus, but nowhere else (Leviticus 5:21; 6:2; 19:11, 15, 17, etc.), and is usually translated "neighbour;" it implies one united to another by the possession of common nature, rights, and privileges. God could speak only of One thus associated with himself, that is, of him who could say, "I and my Father are One" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). The term is variously translated by the versions. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="accented"> = </span><span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">Virum cohaerentem mihi.</span> That the Shepherd is Messiah is proved by Christ's application of the following clause to himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</span> When Christ was apprehended, all the disciples forsook him and fled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>); and what they did was done by others. Even the faithful few were scandalized at the cross The command, "Smite the Shepherd," like the apostrophe, "Awake, O sword," shows that it was God's purpose that was being there executed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). It is also thus intimated that the dispersion of the Jews, and their denationalizing, were results of this rejection and smiting of the Shepherd. This dispersion is farther explained in vers. 8, 9, where it is shown that to some it will be ruin, to others salvation. I will turn mine hand. "To turn," or "bring back the hand over," is used in a good and a bad sense (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>). There is a promise of comfort in the use of the phrase here. God's hand shall cover and protect some, while he punishes the others. Those thus protected are called the little ones, the humble and meek. This recalls Christ's words to his disciples, "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:7-9 Here is a prophecy of the sufferings of Christ. God the Father gave order to the sword of his justice to awake against his Son, when he freely made his soul an offering for sin. As God, he is called my Fellow. Christ and the Father are one. He is the Shepherd who was to lay down his life for the sheep. If a Sacrifice, he must be slain, for without shedding of the life-blood there was no remission. This sword must awake against him, yet he had no sin of his own to answer for. It may refer to the whole of Christ's sufferings, especially his agonies in the garden and on the cross, when he endured unspeakable anguish till Divine justice was fully satisfied. Smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. This passage our Lord Jesus declares was fulfilled, when all his disciples, in the night wherein he was betrayed, forsook him and fled. It has, and shall have its accomplishment, in the destruction of the corrupt and hypocritical part of the professed church. Because of the sin of the Jews in rejecting and crucifying Christ, and in opposing his gospel, the Romans would destroy the greater part. But a remnant would be saved. And if we are his people, we shall be refined as gold; he will be God, and the end of all our trials and sufferings will be praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</body></html>
