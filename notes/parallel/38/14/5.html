If Azal, or Azel, be a proper name, it is with some probability identified with Beth-ezel, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a>, a village on the east of Olivet. The meaning in this case is that the valley should extend from the west unto the east side of the Mount of Olives, and that in it the people shall find an asylum, that they might not be involved in the judgments which fall on the enemy. Some take <span class="accented">Azal</span> to mean "union," and see in it a symbol of the union of the Law and the gospel, or the Jew and Gentile, in one Church - the valley of God's mountain extending to "union;" that is, to enfolding all the faithful (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The earthquake in the days of Uzziah.</span> This is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>, but not in the historical books (see note on Amos, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>).

The "holy ones" are the angels (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; and the parallel predictions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-7 The Lord Jesus often stood upon the Mount of Olives when on earth. He ascended from thence to heaven, and then desolations and distresses came upon the Jewish nation. Such is the view taken of this figuratively; but many consider it as a notice of events yet unfulfilled, and that it relates to troubles of which we cannot now form a full idea. Every believer, being related to God as his God, may triumph in the expectation of Christ's coming in power, and speak of it with pleasure. During a long season, the state of the church would be deformed by sin; there would be a mixture of truth and error, of happiness and misery. Such is the experience of God's people, a mingled state of grace and corruption. But, when the season is at the worst, and most unpromising, the Lord will turn darkness into light; deliverance comes when God's people have done looking for it.</body></html>
