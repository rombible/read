The Levitical distinction shall be abolished, and the Lord's service shall be perfect freedom. Every member of the Church, however humble his station or mean his acquirements, shall be a saint and fit for the Lord's use (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Canaanite;</span> <span class="accented">mercator</span> (Vulgate). The word is used in the sense of "trafficker," or "merchant," in Job 40:30 (Job 41:6, Authorized Version); <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-24.htm">Proverbs 31:24</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>). If any vessel might now be used in God's service, worshippers would no longer be obliged to buy special bowls from those who sold in the temple courts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>). But it is best in agreement with the context to take "Canaanite" to mean any unclean or profane person (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>, etc.). Thus Daniel, in the History of Susanna, ver. 56, addresses the wicked elder, "Thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Jude;" and Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>) calls the chiefs of Israel "rulers of Sodom," and "people of Gomorrah." Henceforward the "people shall be all righteous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>). There shall be one, holy, Catholic Church. Thus the vision of the golden candlestick (ch. 4.) is fulfilled; and that this should come to pass is the design of God's manifold providences and operations (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:16-21 As it is impossible for all nations literally to come to Jerusalem once a year, to keep a feast, it is evident that a figurative meaning must here be applied. Gospel worship is represented by the keeping of the feast of tabernacles. Every day of a Christian's life is a day of the feast of tabernacles; every Lord's day especially is the great day of the feast; therefore every day let us worship the Lord of hosts, and keep every Lord's day with peculiar solemnity. It is just for God to withhold the blessings of grace from those who do not attend the means of grace. It is a sin that is its own punishment; those who forsake the duty, forfeit the privilege of communion with God. A time of complete peace and purity of the church will arrive. Men will carry on their common affairs, and their sacred services, upon the same holy principles of faith, love and obedience. Real holiness shall be more diffused, because there shall be a more plentiful pouring forth of the Spirit of holiness than ever before. There shall be holiness even in common things. Every action and every enjoyment of the believer, should be so regulated according to the will of God, that it may be directed to his glory. Our whole lives should be as one constant sacrifice, or act of devotion; no selfish motive should prevail in any of our actions. But how far is the Christian church from this state of purity! Other times, however, are at hand, and the Lord will reform and enlarge his church, as he has promised. Yet in heaven alone will perfect holiness and happiness be found.</body></html>
