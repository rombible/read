With the absence of light and sun shall come bitter frost, which impedes all activity, and kills life: or, taking the Septuagint rendering, there shall no longer be the interchange of seasons, but one lasting sunshine. It is plain that a time of distress and calamity is intended, and that the passage is threatening and not consolatory, at any rate, at first. There is solid ground for the rendering of the Revised Version margin, adopted by Cheyne and others, which is according to the Khetib, "There shall not be light, the bright ones shall contract themselves;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the heavenly bodies shall contract their light, or be heaped confusedly together, and cease to shine. The prediction in this case may be compared with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12, 13</a>. The Authorized Version is explained in the margin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "It shall not be clear in some places, and dark in other places of the world" - a gloss which is inadmissible. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-7 The Lord Jesus often stood upon the Mount of Olives when on earth. He ascended from thence to heaven, and then desolations and distresses came upon the Jewish nation. Such is the view taken of this figuratively; but many consider it as a notice of events yet unfulfilled, and that it relates to troubles of which we cannot now form a full idea. Every believer, being related to God as his God, may triumph in the expectation of Christ's coming in power, and speak of it with pleasure. During a long season, the state of the church would be deformed by sin; there would be a mixture of truth and error, of happiness and misery. Such is the experience of God's people, a mingled state of grace and corruption. But, when the season is at the worst, and most unpromising, the Lord will turn darkness into light; deliverance comes when God's people have done looking for it.</body></html>
