The</span> outrages offered to the captive city are such as are indicated in the case of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-11.htm">Lamentations 5:11</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Half of the city.</span> The term "half" must not be pressed, as if it contradicted the mention of the two-thirds that were to perish, according to the prediction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-8.htm">Zechariah 13:8</a>. It is a mere rhetorical expression. Or it may apply to the city alone, while the other referred to the whole land. <span class="cmt_word">Shall not be out off.</span> In the former captivity all the people were carried away; in this capture of the city a remnant shall be left therein. It is plain from this statement that the prophecy cannot apply to the destruction of the city by the Romans; for, according to the account of Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:09), the city itself was razed to the ground, and all the inhabitants were either put to the sword or sold for slaves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-7 The Lord Jesus often stood upon the Mount of Olives when on earth. He ascended from thence to heaven, and then desolations and distresses came upon the Jewish nation. Such is the view taken of this figuratively; but many consider it as a notice of events yet unfulfilled, and that it relates to troubles of which we cannot now form a full idea. Every believer, being related to God as his God, may triumph in the expectation of Christ's coming in power, and speak of it with pleasure. During a long season, the state of the church would be deformed by sin; there would be a mixture of truth and error, of happiness and misery. Such is the experience of God's people, a mingled state of grace and corruption. But, when the season is at the worst, and most unpromising, the Lord will turn darkness into light; deliverance comes when God's people have done looking for it.</body></html>
