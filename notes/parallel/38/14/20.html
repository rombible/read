10. <span class="accented">Then everything alike shall be holy, and the ungodly shall be altogether excluded from the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the bells of the horses.</span> The prophet, describing the holiness of the theocracy, uses imagery drawn from the ritual customs of the Law. "The bells," says Henderson, "were small metallic plates, suspended from the necks or heads of horses and camels, for the sake of ornament, and making a tinkling noise by striking against each other like cymbals." Probably these plates had the names of the owners engraven on them. The Septuagint gives "bridle," which possibly the unusual word <span class="accented">metzilloth</span> may mean. <span class="cmt_word">HOLINESS</span> (<span class="accented">holy</span>) <span class="cmt_word">UNTO THE LORD</span>; <span class="accented">Sanctum Domino</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> (Septuagint). This was the inscription upon the golden plate on the mitre of the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). The affixing of this inscription on the trappings of horses signifies that the commonest things shall become holy, all things that men use for work, profit, or ornament shall be consecrated to God's service. <span class="cmt_word">The pots in the Lord's house.</span> The "pots" are vessels of inferior sanctity used for boiling the meat of the sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The bowls before the altar.</span> These held the blood of the victims for sprinkling on the altar, and the sacred libations, and were considered of superior sanctity. The prophet announces that now all shall be holy, the lower equal to the highest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:16-21 As it is impossible for all nations literally to come to Jerusalem once a year, to keep a feast, it is evident that a figurative meaning must here be applied. Gospel worship is represented by the keeping of the feast of tabernacles. Every day of a Christian's life is a day of the feast of tabernacles; every Lord's day especially is the great day of the feast; therefore every day let us worship the Lord of hosts, and keep every Lord's day with peculiar solemnity. It is just for God to withhold the blessings of grace from those who do not attend the means of grace. It is a sin that is its own punishment; those who forsake the duty, forfeit the privilege of communion with God. A time of complete peace and purity of the church will arrive. Men will carry on their common affairs, and their sacred services, upon the same holy principles of faith, love and obedience. Real holiness shall be more diffused, because there shall be a more plentiful pouring forth of the Spirit of holiness than ever before. There shall be holiness even in common things. Every action and every enjoyment of the believer, should be so regulated according to the will of God, that it may be directed to his glory. Our whole lives should be as one constant sacrifice, or act of devotion; no selfish motive should prevail in any of our actions. But how far is the Christian church from this state of purity! Other times, however, are at hand, and the Lord will reform and enlarge his church, as he has promised. Yet in heaven alone will perfect holiness and happiness be found.</body></html>
