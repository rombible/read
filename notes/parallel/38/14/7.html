Its peculiar character, and the moment of its arrival, are known to God, and God only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>). Not day, nor night. It cannot be called truly the one or the other, because there is darkness in the day and light at night, as the following clause says. This is symbolically explained by St. Ephraem, "It will not be altogether consolation, nor altogether affliction." It is not full daylight, for calamity presses; it is not deep night, because there is hope amid the distress. <span class="cmt_word">At evening time it shall be light.</span> In the midst of trouble and danger deliverance shall come. The whole section is a figurative description of the fortunes of the Church militant, even as Christ announced to his disciples: "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); "If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>); "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-7 The Lord Jesus often stood upon the Mount of Olives when on earth. He ascended from thence to heaven, and then desolations and distresses came upon the Jewish nation. Such is the view taken of this figuratively; but many consider it as a notice of events yet unfulfilled, and that it relates to troubles of which we cannot now form a full idea. Every believer, being related to God as his God, may triumph in the expectation of Christ's coming in power, and speak of it with pleasure. During a long season, the state of the church would be deformed by sin; there would be a mixture of truth and error, of happiness and misery. Such is the experience of God's people, a mingled state of grace and corruption. But, when the season is at the worst, and most unpromising, the Lord will turn darkness into light; deliverance comes when God's people have done looking for it.</body></html>
