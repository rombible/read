The Revised Version renders, "shall be turned as the Arabah," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the Jordan ghor, a valley of abnormal fertility. <span class="cmt_word">From Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the north of Judah to its southern boundary. Geba was a town and district on the edge of the great Wady Suweinit, five miles north of Jerusalem. It is identified with Jeba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>), and it formed the northern boundary of the kingdom of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>). Rimmon is described as "south of Jerusalem," to distinguish it from a town of the same name in Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-13.htm">Joshua 19:13</a>), and from the famous rock Rimmon, to which the Benjamites fled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45, 47</a>). It was situated in the territory of Simeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a>), and has been identified with <span class="accented">Umm-er-Rummamin</span>, a town ten miles north of Beersheba. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be lifted up.</span> Jerusalem shall remain exalted on its hill, while all the country around sinks into a plain - a figure representing the spiritual exaltation of the new theocracy. <span class="cmt_word">Inhabited in her place;</span> or, <span class="accented">shall dwell in her place.</span> Shall occupy her ancient limits, and abide there safely without fear (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">From Benjamin's gate,</span> etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>). It is difficult to define the given boundaries with certainty in every particular. Benjamin's gate is the same as the gate of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>), so called as leading to the territory of Benjamin, and beyond again to that of Ephraim. It was situated in the north or second wall. From this point the course of the wall is followed, first to the west, and then to the east. <span class="cmt_word">The first gate.</span> This was in the eastern part at this wall, and is the same as "the old gate," or "gate of the old town," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The corner gate</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>) was at the northwest corner, west of the gate of Benjamin, at the angle where the first and second walls approached each other. These dimensions would give the breadth of the city from east to west. <span class="cmt_word">The tower of Hananeel</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3</a>:l) was at the northeast corner of the north wall, where the citadel Basis or Antonia afterwards stood. <span class="cmt_word">The king's wine presses</span> were probably near "the king's garden" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>), at the southeast extremity of the city. They may have been cut out of the rock, as was often the case. This description gives the extent of the city from north to south. Thus Zechariah illustrates the growth and stability of the Church of God by the figure of the earthly city Jerusalem, firmly and orderly built, and inhabited by a teeming population, as the following verse shows. There is no ground for expecting the literal fulfilment of this prediction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:8-15 Some consider that the progress of the gospel, beginning from Jerusalem, is referred to by the living waters flowing from that city. Neither shall the gospel and means of grace, nor the graces of the Spirit wrought in the hearts of believers by those means, ever fail, by reason either of the heat of persecution, or storms of temptation, or the blasts of any other affliction. Tremendous judgments appear to be foretold, to be sent upon those who should oppose the settlement of the Jews in their own land. How far they are to be understood literally, events alone can determine. The furious rage and malice which stir up men against each other, are faint shadows of the enmity which reigns among those who have perished in their sins. Even the inferior creatures often suffer for the sin of man, and in his plagues. Thus God will show his displeasure against sin.</body></html>
