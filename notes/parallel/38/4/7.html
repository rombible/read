All obstacles shall be removed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-4.htm">Luke 3:4, 5</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (intrans.), "that thou shouldst prosper;" "ut corrigas" (Jerome). <span class="cmt_word">He shall bring forth the headstone thereof.</span> "He" is evidently Zerubbabel. He shall commence and put the finishing stroke to the work of rebuilding the temple. Many commentators take this stone to be the one that completes the building, "the topstone." But it may well be questioned whether a building like the temple could have any such stone. An arch or a pyramid may have a crowning stone, but no other edifice; nor is there any proof that such a topstone was known or its erection celebrated. It may be a mere metaphor for the completion of the work. It is better, however, to take it as the cornerstone, to which we know great importance was attached (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-6.htm">Job 38:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, etc.). This stone, on which the building rests, Zerubbabel will bring forth from the workshop; as the next verses say, his hands have laid the foundation. That action, already past, is represented as future, the regular commencement of the work under Zerubbabel's direction being intimated, and its happy conclusion promised. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "And I will bring forth the stone of the inheritance" - the meaning of which is obscure, though Jerome explains it by considering it an allusion to Christ. With <span class="cmt_word">shoutings</span>, crying, <span class="cmt_word">Grace, grace unto it!</span> All the by standers, as the stone is placed, shout in acclamation, "God's favour rest upon it!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>). The LXX. seems to have mistaken the sense, rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "The grace of it the equality of grace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>); and to have led St. Jerome astray, who translates, "Et exsaequabit gratiam gratiae ejus," and comments thus: "We all have received of his fulness, and grace for grace, that is, the grace of the gospel for the grace of the Law, in order theft the Israelites and the heathen who believe may receive equal grace and a like blessing." The Targum recognizes here a Messianic prophecy: "He will reveal the Messiah whose Name is spoken of from all eternity, and he shall rule over all the kingdoms." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The prophet's spirit was willing to attend, but the flesh was weak. We should beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken us, and we should then stir up ourselves. The church is a golden candlestick, or lamp-bearer, set up for enlightening this dark world, and holding forth the light of Divine revelation. Two olive trees were seen, one on each side the candlestick, from which oil flowed into the bowl without ceasing. God brings to pass his gracious purposes concerning his church, without any art or labour of man; sometimes he makes use of his instruments, yet he needs them not. This represented the abundance of Divine grace, for the enlightening and making holy the ministers and members of the church, and which cannot be procured or prevented by any human power. The vision assures us that the good work of building the temple, should be brought to a happy end. The difficulty is represented as a great mountain. But all difficulties shall vanish, and all the objections be got over. Faith will remove mountains, and make them plains. Christ is our Zerubbabel; mountains of difficulty were in the way of his undertaking, but nothing is too hard for him. What comes from the grace of God, may, in faith, be committed to the grace of God, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands.</body></html>
