as the Targum glosses, "on account of the edifice, because it was small." Small as the present work was, it was a pledge of the full completion, and was therefore not to be despised. So the question is equivalent to, "Can any one, after these promises and prophecies, presume to be doubtful about the future?" <span class="cmt_word">For they shall rejoice</span>, etc. The subject of the verbs is that which comes last in position, the seven eyes of Jehovah; and the verse is best translated thus: "For (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> seeing that) these seven eyes of Jehovah, which run through all the earth, behold with joy the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel." The work is not contemptible, since the Lord regards it with favour, watches, and directs it. The LXX. and Vulgate (followed nearly by the Authorized Version) make the despisers the subject of the verbs, and lamely dissociate the final clause entirely from the preceding. The version given above is in accordance with the Masoretic accentuation. <span class="cmt_word">The plummet;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the stone, the tin</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">lapidem stanneum</span>, "the stone of tin" (Vulgate). Tin is not found in Palestine; it was imported by the Phoenicians in great abundance, and from them the Jews obtained it. The supply must have come from Spain or Britain. With <span class="cmt_word">those seven.</span> The preposition is an interpolation of the Authorized Version. It should be, "even these seven," explaining who are "they" at the head of the clause. <span class="cmt_word">The eyes of the Lord.</span> The "seven eyes" have been already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>, where see note). They are expressive of God's watchful providence and care. Which run to and fro. This clause further enforces the previous image (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-10 The exact fulfilment of Scripture prophecies is a convincing proof of their Divine original. Though the instruments be weak and unlikely, yet God often chooses such, to bring about great things by them. Let not the dawning light be despised; it will shine more and more to the perfect day. Those who despaired of finishing the work, shall rejoice when they see Zerubbabel giving directions what to do, and taking care that the work be done. It is a comfort to us that the same all-wise, almighty Providence, which governs the earth, is in particular conversant about the church. All that have the plummet in their hands, must look up to the eyes of the Lord, have constant regard to Divine Providence, act in dependence on its guidance and submission to its disposals. Let us fix our faith on Christ, and view Him carrying on his work according to his own glorious plan, and daily bringing his spiritual building nearer to completion.</body></html>
