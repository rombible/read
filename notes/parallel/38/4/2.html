This vision of the candlestick, with its seven lamps fed by two olive trees, signifies that the work of rebuilding the temple, and preparing the way for the Church of the true Israel, was to be accomplished by relying, not on human resources, but on Divine aid. Thus were Zerubbabel and his people roused to perseverance and energy in their good work, of which the final sucess is assured. <span class="cmt_word">I have looked;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint), "I have seen." <span class="cmt_word">A candlestick all of gold</span>. The candelabrum as described differs in some particulars from that in the tabernacle, though the same word<span class="accented">, menorath</span>, is used in both cases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-17.htm">Exodus 37:17</a>, etc.). In Solomon's temple there were ten candelabra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>), which were carried away to Babylon when Jerusalem was taken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a>). The single candelabrum of Zerubbabel's temple is mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:21 1 Macc. 4:49, 50. The one sculptured on the arch of Titus may be a truthful representation of that in Herod's temple, but probably is not the same as that in the second edifice (comp. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:04, 4). The candelabrum in the vision differed from the original one in three particulars: it had a central reservoir; it had also seven pipes; and it was supplied with oil by two olive trees. <span class="cmt_word">With a</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="cmt_word">howl upon the top of it.</span> The "bowl" (<span class="accented">gullah</span>) is a reservoir for oil placed at the top of the candelabrum; and from it tubes led the oil for the supply of the lamps. In the tabernacle each lamp was separate, and trimmed and filled by the ministering priests; the mystic lamps needed no human agency to keep them supplied. They were fed by the "bowl." The word is translated in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">lampas</span>; hence some have supposed that, besides the seven lamps, there was another large light in the centre; but the Greek and Latin rendering is mistaken, the word meaning "a fountain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>), or "a ball" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-41.htm">1 Kings 7:41</a>), or "a round bowl" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof.</span> The Hebrew is, literally rendered, <span class="accented">seven and seven pipes to the lamps which are upon its top.</span> The LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "And seven vessels for the lamps which are upon it;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Septem infusoria lucernis, quae erant super caput ejus</span>. These versions imply that there was one supply pipe to each of the lamps, which seems most natural. In this case, the first "seven" in the text must be an interpolation. Commentators who regard the present reading as correct have taken various ways in explaining it. Some multiply the number into itself, and make the pipes forty-nine; but this is unwarranted by Hebrew usage (Henderson). Others add the numbers together, making fourteen; but here again the copulative <span class="accented">vau</span>, which implies diversity, is an objection. The Revised Version has, "There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, taking the words distributively; but the number of tubes seems here to be unnecessarily large. Dr. Wright considers that there were two pipes to each lamp, one set connecting each to the central bowl, and one connecting the several lamps together. One, however, does not see of what particular use the second set is. Dr. Wright, p. 84, gives a drawing of the candelabrum with its appurtenances, according to his notion of the vision. The Authorized Version seems to give the correct idea of the passage, whether we arrive at it by rejecting the first "seven," or by considering that it is repeated for emphasis' sake, as Cornelius Lapide and Pressel think: "Seven are the lamps upon it - seven, I say, and seven the pipes." Take it as we may, the point is that the oil is well and copiously supplied to the several lights. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The prophet's spirit was willing to attend, but the flesh was weak. We should beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken us, and we should then stir up ourselves. The church is a golden candlestick, or lamp-bearer, set up for enlightening this dark world, and holding forth the light of Divine revelation. Two olive trees were seen, one on each side the candlestick, from which oil flowed into the bowl without ceasing. God brings to pass his gracious purposes concerning his church, without any art or labour of man; sometimes he makes use of his instruments, yet he needs them not. This represented the abundance of Divine grace, for the enlightening and making holy the ministers and members of the church, and which cannot be procured or prevented by any human power. The vision assures us that the good work of building the temple, should be brought to a happy end. The difficulty is represented as a great mountain. But all difficulties shall vanish, and all the objections be got over. Faith will remove mountains, and make them plains. Christ is our Zerubbabel; mountains of difficulty were in the way of his undertaking, but nothing is too hard for him. What comes from the grace of God, may, in faith, be committed to the grace of God, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands.</body></html>
