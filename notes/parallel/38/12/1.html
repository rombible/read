This is the title of the second oracle, corresponding to that at the head of ch. 9. Though the literal Israel has been rejected, as we saw in the last "burden," a new people of God. arises (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>), the Messianic theocracy, which is also called Israel, whose fortunes the prophet herein delineates, describing its probation, its contests, triumph, and development. The body is like its Head; as the good Shepherd, Christ, was persecuted and rejected, so his members, the true Israelites, suffer at the hand of the world and Satan, before they are finally glorified. Some critics suppose that "Israel" here is written by mistake for "Jerusalem," as possibly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> (see note on Zechariah 1:19). It is best to put a full stop after "Israel," and begin a new sentence with "Thus saith the Lord," or "The saying of Jehovah." <span class="cmt_word">Which stretcheth forth the heavens,</span> etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). The attributes of God. are mentioned here that all may believe that what he has promised, that he is able to perform. He is not only the Creator, but also the Pro-server of all things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Formeth the spirit of man within him.</span> God creates the souls of men, and moulds and guides them. In life and death men work out his purposes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-9.htm">Hebrews 12:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Here is a Divine prediction, which will be a heavy burden to all the enemies of the church. But it is for Israel; for their comfort and benefit. It is promised that God will make foolish the counsels, and weaken the courage of the enemies of the church. The exact meaning is not clear; but God often begins by calling the poor and despised; and in that day even the feeblest will resemble David, and be as eminent in courage and every thing good. Desirable indeed is it that the examples and labours of Christians should render them as fire among wood, as a torch in a sheaf, to kindle the flame of Divine love, to spread religion on the right hand and on the left.</body></html>
