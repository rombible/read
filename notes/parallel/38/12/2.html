<span class="accented">superliminare crapulae</span> (Vulgate). This Jerome explains to mean that any one who crosses the threshold of Jerusalem in hostile guise shall totter and fall. Jerusalem is the capital and type of the Messianic theocracy; the hostile powers of the world crowd round her, like thirsting men round a bowl of wine; but they find the drought is fatal to them; they stagger back discomfited and destroyed. The figure of the cup and drunkenness is often employed to denote the judgment of God upon transgressors, which makes them incapable of defence or escape (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, etc.; Jeremiah 51:39, 57; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The people;</span> <span class="accented">the peoples</span> (so vers. 3, 4, 6).

Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;</span>, "In Judaea there shall be a blockade against Jerusalem;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sed et Juda erit in obsidione contra Jerusalem</span>, which may mean that Judah shall be among those that besiege Jerusalem, or when Jerusalem is beset Judah shall suffer the same calamity. Pusey and Revised Version render, "And upon Judah also shall it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'the burden'] be in the siege against Jerusalem." Cheyne, "And also on [or, 'over '] Judah it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the protection and deliverance implied in the first clause of the verse] shall be, in the siege," etc. Any interpretation of the passage which makes Judah join with the enemy in attacking Jerusalem is precluded by the very intimate union between Judah and Jerusalem denoted in vers. 4-7, and by the hostility of the nations against Judah. Cheyne's explanation is hardly a natural one, however suitable. Lowe ('Hebr. Stud. Comm.') renders, "And also on Judah [shall fall this reeling] during the siege [which is to take place] against Jerusalem." It seems best to render, with Alexander, "Also against Judah shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not only the mother city, but all the country, shall be exposed to hostile invasion. This suits ver. 5, where the chieftains of Judah are represented as trusting in the valour of the inhabitants of Jerusalem when they are incurring the same danger. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Here is a Divine prediction, which will be a heavy burden to all the enemies of the church. But it is for Israel; for their comfort and benefit. It is promised that God will make foolish the counsels, and weaken the courage of the enemies of the church. The exact meaning is not clear; but God often begins by calling the poor and despised; and in that day even the feeblest will resemble David, and be as eminent in courage and every thing good. Desirable indeed is it that the examples and labours of Christians should render them as fire among wood, as a torch in a sheaf, to kindle the flame of Divine love, to spread religion on the right hand and on the left.</body></html>
