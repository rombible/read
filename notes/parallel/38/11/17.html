The LXX., recognizing that no special shepherd is signified, renders, <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "Alas for those who tend vanities!" St. Jerome, expounding the verse of antichrist, "O pastor, et idolum!" That leaveth the flock. Thus Christ speaks of the hireling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>). The sword shall be upon his arm, etc. The punishment denounced is in accordance with the neglect of the shepherd's duties. <span class="accented">The sword</span> represents the instrument of punishment, whatever it he; the right eye, the severity of the retribution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-2.htm">1 Samuel 11:2</a>). The arm that ought to have defended the flock shall be withered up as by catalepsy; the eye that should have watched for their safety shall be blinded. This is the judgment on the foolish shepherd. Ewald thinks that the passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7-9</a> is out of place there, and belonged originally to the end of the, present chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:15-17 God, having showed the misery of this people in their being justly left by the Good Shepherd, shows their further misery in being abused by foolish shepherds. The description suits the character Christ gives of the scribes and Pharisees. They never do any thing to support the weak, or comfort the feeble-minded; but seek their own ease, while they are barbarous to the flock. The idol shepherd has the garb and appearance of a shepherd, receives submission, and is supported at much expense; but he leaves the flock to perish through neglect, or leads them to ruin by his example. This suits many in different churches and nations, but the warning had an awful fulfilment in the Jewish teachers. And while such deceive others to their ruin, they will themselves have the deepest condemnation.</body></html>
