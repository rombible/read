but it should be, <span class="accented">So I fed</span>. It is the account of what the prophet did in accordance with the command in ver. 4 (see the end of this verse, "and I fed"). <span class="cmt_word">Even you, O poor of the flock.</span> There is difficulty about the word rendered "you" (<span class="accented">lachen</span>) which may be the personal pronoun, or an adverb meaning "therefore," "therewith," "truly," or a preposition, "on account of;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">propter hoc.</span> The best rendering is, <span class="accented">I fed the flock therefore the poor among the flock.</span> "Therefore" refers to the previous command. It is also rendered "in sooth." The LXX., arranging the letters differently, translates, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> "I will go and tend the flock of slaughter in the land of Canaan;" some render the last words, "for the merchants." This Jerome interprets to mean that the Lord will nourish the Israelites for slaughter in the land of the Gentiles (but see note on ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">And I took unto me two staves.</span> Executing in vision his commission of feeding the flock, the prophet, as the representative of the Shepherd, took two shepherd's staves. The two staves intimate the manifold care of God for his flock from the earliest days, and the two blessings which he designed to bestow (as the names of the staves show), favour and unity. <span class="cmt_word">Beauty</span>; <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Decorem</span> (Vulgate); "Graciousness" (Revised Version margin). It probably means the favour and grace of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Bands</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Those that bind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "Cord;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Funiculum.</span> The name is meant to express the union of all the members of the flock, especially that between Israel and Judah (see ver. 14). These make one flock under one shepherd. <span class="cmt_word">I fed the flock.</span> This repetition emphasizes the beginning of the verse, and expresses God's ears in time past and in time to come also. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:4-14 Christ came into this world for judgment to the Jewish church and nation, which were wretchedly corrupt and degenerate. Those have their minds wofully blinded, who do ill, and justify themselves in it; but God will not hold those guiltless who hold themselves so. How can we go to God to beg a blessing on unlawful methods of getting wealth, or to return thanks for success in them? There was a general decay of religion among them, and they regarded it not. The Good Shepherd would feed his flock, but his attention would chiefly be directed to the poor. As an emblem, the prophet seems to have taken two staves; Beauty, denoted the privileges of the Jewish nation, in their national covenant; the other he called Bands, denoting the harmony which hitherto united them as the flock of God. But they chose to cleave to false teachers. The carnal mind and the friendship of the world are enmity to God; and God hates all the workers of iniquity: it is easy to foresee what this will end in. The prophet demanded wages, or a reward, and received thirty pieces of silver. By Divine direction he cast it to the potter, as in disdain for the smallness of the sum. This shadowed forth the bargain of Judas to betray Christ, and the final method of applying it. Nothing ruins a people so certainly, as weakening the brotherhood among them. This follows the dissolving of the covenant between God and them: when sin abounds, love waxes cold, and civil contests follow. No wonder if those fall out among themselves, who have provoked God to fall out with them. Wilful contempt of Christ is the great cause of men's ruin. And if professors rightly valued Christ, they would not contend about little matters.</body></html>
