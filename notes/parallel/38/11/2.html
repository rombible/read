It is the tree of which Solomon made floors, doom, and ceiling in his temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15, 34</a>), and David harps (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>).

Trees are being spoken of, and so the primary sense is, "the goodly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>) or "glorious trees." Metaphorically, the chiefs of Israel may be intended. <span class="cmt_word">Bashan</span>, famous for its oaks, is next visited by the invading force, and its trees are felled for the use of the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">The forest of the vintage.</span> The Authorized Version here follows, very inappropriately, the correction of the Keri. The original reading should be retained and translated, "the inaccessible forest" - an expression appropriate to Lebanon. If Lebanon is not spared, much less shall Bashan escape.

How can the fir trees stand, if the cedars fall? The falls of the wise and good into sin, and the falls of the rich and great into trouble, are loud alarms to those every way their inferiors. It is sad with a people, when those who should be as shepherds to them, are as young lions. The pride of Jordan was the thickets on the banks; and when the river overflowed the banks, the lions came up from them roaring. Thus the doom of Jerusalem may alarm other churches.</body></html>
