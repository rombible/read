He was going to allow the people to be chastised by an instrument whom he would permit to work his will upon them. As this evil shepherd was to arise to punish them for their rejection of Messiah, he must represent some person or power that existed subsequent to Christ's death. Many consider that he symbolizes the Romans; but these people could not be deemed to exercise pastoral care over the Israelites, nor could their neglect of this (ver. 17) be attributed to them as a sin; nor, again, did their destruction follow upon the overthrow of the Jewish polity (ver. 18). Others see here a prediction of the coming of antichrist; but the character of "shepherd" does not suit his attributes as given elsewhere; at any rate. this cannot be the primary reference of the symbol, though all evil powers that oppose the Church of Christ are in some sense images and anticipations of antichrist. The genuine reference here is to the native chiefs and rulers ("in the land") who arose in the later times of the nation - monsters like Herod, false Christs and false prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5, 11, 12, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>), hirelings who made merchandise of the flock, teachers who came in their own name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>), and deceived the people to their destruction. <span class="cmt_word">Which shall not visit those that be cut off;</span> or, <span class="accented">those that are perishing.</span> This foolish shepherd shall perform none of the offices of a good shepherd; he will not care for and tend those that are in danger of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The young one;</span> rather, <span class="accented">those that are scattered</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">dispersum</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That that is broken.</span> Bruised, or with limb fractured. <span class="cmt_word">Feed that that standeth still;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that standeth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is sound and healthy. This shepherd attended neither to the diseased nor to the healthy sheep. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "that which is whole." <span class="cmt_word">He shall eat the flesh of the fat.</span> He thinks only how to get personal advantage from the flock (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Tear their claws</span> (<span class="accented">hoofs</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in pieces,</span> as some say, by making them traverse rough places, and not caring where he led them; but as such travelling would not specially injure sheep, and as the immediate context is concerned with their treatment as food, it is better to see here a picture of a greedy and voracious man who tears asunder the very hoofs to suck out all the nourishment he can find, or one who mutilates the fattest of his flock, that they may not stray, and that he may always have a dainty morsel at hand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:15-17 God, having showed the misery of this people in their being justly left by the Good Shepherd, shows their further misery in being abused by foolish shepherds. The description suits the character Christ gives of the scribes and Pharisees. They never do any thing to support the weak, or comfort the feeble-minded; but seek their own ease, while they are barbarous to the flock. The idol shepherd has the garb and appearance of a shepherd, receives submission, and is supported at much expense; but he leaves the flock to perish through neglect, or leads them to ruin by his example. This suits many in different churches and nations, but the warning had an awful fulfilment in the Jewish teachers. And while such deceive others to their ruin, they will themselves have the deepest condemnation.</body></html>
