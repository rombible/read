5. <span class="accented">The evil rulers set over them for their sins shall be removed, and Israel shall be firmly established.</span> Ver. 3, - <span class="cmt_word">Mine anger was</span> (<span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="cmt_word">kindled against the shepherds.</span> These heathen rulers were indeed God's instruments in punishing his people, but they had exceeded their commission, and afflicted Israel in order to carry out their own evil designs, and now they themselves shall be chastised. Some commentators raise "the shepherds" to be the rulers of Israel civil and ecclesiastical, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2, 5</a>, etc. But the context leads us to consider them as those who took the place of rulers of Israel when she had no shepherd of her own (ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I punished</span> (<span class="accented">will punish</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the goats</span> (<span class="accented">bellwethers</span>); literally, <span class="accented">will visit upon</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will chastise. The same word (<span class="accented">paquad</span>) is used in the next clause in a good sense. The "goats" are the leading men, those powerful for evil, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>. Hath visited his flock. The reason why the evil shepherds are punished is because God visits his flock in love and care, to see their state and to relieve them from trouble (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>). The house of Judah here includes all the nation, to which it afterwards gave its name. <span class="cmt_word">Hath made</span> (<span class="accented">shall make</span>) <span class="cmt_word">them as his goodly horse</span>. The Israelites shall not only be delivered from oppression, but God shall use them as a stately war horse, richly caparisoned, to tread down enemies and triumph ever them. So he said before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>) that he would make Judah his bow and Ephraim his arrow. (For a description of the war horse, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19-25</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>, where Christ is represented riding on a white horse, and his saints following him on white horses.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Spiritual blessings had been promised under figurative allusions to earthly plenty. Seasonable rain is a great mercy, which we may ask of God when there is most need of it, and we may look for it to come. We must in our prayers ask for mercies in their proper time. The Lord would make bright clouds, and give showers of rain. This may be an exhortation to seek the influences of the Holy Spirit, in faith and by prayer, through which the blessings held forth in the promises are obtained and enjoyed. The prophet shows the folly of making addresses to idols, as their fathers had done. The Lord visited the remnant of his flock in mercy, and was about to renew their courage and strength for conflict and victory. Every creature is to us what God makes it to be. Every one raised to support the nation, as a corner-stone does the building, or to unite those that differ, as nails join the different timbers, must come from the Lord; and those employed to overcome their enemies, must have strength and success from him. This may be applied to Christ; to him we must look to raise up persons to unite, support, and defend his people. He never will say, Seek ye me in vain.</body></html>
