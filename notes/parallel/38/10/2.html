The prophet supports his exhortation to pray to Jehovah by showing the worthlessness of trust in idols. <span class="cmt_word">Idols</span>; <span class="accented">teraphim.</span> What these were is not known for certain. They seem to have been images of human form and sometimes of life size, corresponding in some degree to the lares or penates of the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>). They were supposed to be capable of bestowing temporal blessings and giving oracles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Have spoken vanity.</span> Gave worthless, misleading responses. The mention of teraphim in this passage is thought to indicate a date anterior to the Captivity; but the prophet is speaking of past events, of the results of these base superstitions in former, not present, time. Three kinds of superstition are mentioned. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "speaking" images. These are the first. Secondly come the soothsayers, <span class="cmt_word">the diviners,</span> persons who pretended to predict the future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-9.htm">Jeremiah 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; Habukkuk 2:18). <span class="cmt_word">Have told false dreams;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">somniatores locuti sunt frustra</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>, "spake false dreams." The Vulgate seems to be correct, "dreams, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dreamers, spake deceit." This is the third class among the practisers of superstitious observances. They comfort in vain, when they promise temporal blessings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-34.htm">Job 21:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they went their way as a flock.</span> Because they trusted in these vain superstitions, the Israelites had to leave their own place, were led into exile like a flock of sheep driven away for sale or slaughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They were troubled.</span> They were and are still oppressed by the heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Because there was</span> (<span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="cmt_word">no shepherd.</span> Because they had no king to guard and lead them, they fell under the power of foreign rulers, who ill treated and oppressed them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Nehemiah 5:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Spiritual blessings had been promised under figurative allusions to earthly plenty. Seasonable rain is a great mercy, which we may ask of God when there is most need of it, and we may look for it to come. We must in our prayers ask for mercies in their proper time. The Lord would make bright clouds, and give showers of rain. This may be an exhortation to seek the influences of the Holy Spirit, in faith and by prayer, through which the blessings held forth in the promises are obtained and enjoyed. The prophet shows the folly of making addresses to idols, as their fathers had done. The Lord visited the remnant of his flock in mercy, and was about to renew their courage and strength for conflict and victory. Every creature is to us what God makes it to be. Every one raised to support the nation, as a corner-stone does the building, or to unite those that differ, as nails join the different timbers, must come from the Lord; and those employed to overcome their enemies, must have strength and success from him. This may be applied to Christ; to him we must look to raise up persons to unite, support, and defend his people. He never will say, Seek ye me in vain.</body></html>
