Besides this, Assyria is often used loosely for Western Asia or Babylonia, of which, after its submission, it formed a most important feature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-22.htm">Ezra 6:22</a>; and in the Apocrypha, 1 Esdr. 7:15; Judith 1:7 Judith 2:1). In the 'Oracula Sibyllina,' the Assyrians are continually confused with Persians, Babylonians, and other Eastern nations. Egypt and Assyria are here used as types of the countries to which Jews had been banished (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gilead and Lebanon.</span> A designation of the northern district of Palestine, on both sides of the Jordan, in which these tribes had been originally settled.

Josephus testifies to the teeming population of Galilee in later times ('Bell. Jud.,' 2:03, 1; 3:3, 2; 4:1, 2; 7:5). Septuagint, "There shall not even one of them be left behind," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in exile. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-12 Here are precious promises to the people of God, which look to the state of the Jews, and even to the latter days of the church. Preaching the gospel is God's call for souls to come to Jesus Christ. Those whom Christ redeemed by his blood, God will gather by his grace. Difficulties shall be got over easily, and effectually, as those in the way of the deliverance out of Egypt. God himself will be their strength, and their song. When we resist, and so overcome our spiritual enemies, then our hearts shall rejoice. If God strengthen us, we must bestir ourselves in all the duties of the Christian life, must be active in the work of God; and we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.</body></html>
