This is the general meaning of the passage; but the details present difficulties. For "he shall pass" the LXX. gives, "they shall pass through." But the reference is plainly to Jehovah, as the following clause shows. The next two words are in apposition, "the sea," "affliction." Revised Version, "the sea of affliction;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1fbf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>, "in a strait sea;" or, as the Hebrew cannot be so translated, "in a sea, a strait;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">in maris freto.</span> It seems best to take the two words simply as, "the sea, which is affliction." The Red Sea, through which Jehovah led his people, was a figure of the sufferings which they had endured in Egypt, and brought destruction upon their enemies (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16, 17, 24</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Smite the waves</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The river.</span> The Nile. The drying up of the waters of the Nile is a figure of the humiliation of the nations which have been guilty of enslaving the chosen people. The Nile. the representative of Egypt, is mentioned because of the allusion to the bondage in Egypt running through the paragraph. <span class="cmt_word">The pride of Assyria.</span> Pride is noted as the characteristic of Assyria (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sceptre.</span> This may refer to the decadence of the power of Egypt, and the transference of royal authority to strangers; but, regarding the immediate context, we had better translate, "the rod of Egypt," and see in it an allusion to the oppression of the taskmasters during the sojourn in that land. All such tyranny shall be at an end (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-12 Here are precious promises to the people of God, which look to the state of the Jews, and even to the latter days of the church. Preaching the gospel is God's call for souls to come to Jesus Christ. Those whom Christ redeemed by his blood, God will gather by his grace. Difficulties shall be got over easily, and effectually, as those in the way of the deliverance out of Egypt. God himself will be their strength, and their song. When we resist, and so overcome our spiritual enemies, then our hearts shall rejoice. If God strengthen us, we must bestir ourselves in all the duties of the Christian life, must be active in the work of God; and we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.</body></html>
