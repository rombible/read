The appellations are often here used interchangeably. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord rebuke thee.</span> The Lord's rebuke falls with effect where it is directed; it paralyzes the hostile power (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>). Satan's accusation may have been well founded, but it sprang from malice, and was directed against the people whom God was receiving into favour, and therefore it was rejected and rendered innocuous. Some commentators have supposed that St. Jude is alluding to this passage when (ver. 9) he quotes the words of Michael contending about the body of Moses, "The Lord rebuke thee:" but it is more probable that Jude is referring to some rabbinical tradition, or to the apocryphal 'Assumption of Moses' (see the matter examined in Dissertation I. of Dr. Gloag's 'Introduction to the Catholic Epistles'). <span class="cmt_word">That hath chosen Jerusalem (</span><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>). God's election of Israel and renewed acceptance of her is the reason why Satan's accusation is rejected (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7, 8</a>). She is not to be abandoned to the consequences of her sins, nor were God's gracious purposes towards her to be frustrated. "God hath not cast away his people, which he foreknew;" and, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2, 29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This</span>. This man, Joshua, saved from his father's and grandfather's fate (see on Haggai 1:1), a type of the deliverance of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">A brand plucked out of the fire.</span> Israel had been already punished by defeat, captivity, distress, and misery. From these evils, which had almost destroyed her, she had been delivered; and the deliverance would be completed; she should not be cast again into the fire (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>, and note there). The expression is proverbial (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-15.htm">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-23.htm">Jude 1:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 The angel showed Joshua, the high priest, to Zechariah, in a vision. Guilt and corruption are great discouragements when we stand before God. By the guilt of the sins committed by us, we are liable to the justice of God; by the power of sin that dwells in us, we are hateful to the holiness of God. Even God's Israel are in danger on these accounts; but they have relief from Jesus Christ, who is made of God to us both righteousness and sanctification. Joshua, the high priest, is accused as a criminal, but is justified. When we stand before God, to minister to him, or stand up for God, we must expect to meet all the resistance Satan's subtlety and malice can give. Satan is checked by one that has conquered him, and many times silenced him. Those who belong to Christ, will find him ready to appear for them, when Satan appears most strongly against them. A converted soul is a brand plucked out of the fire by a miracle of free grace, therefore shall not be left a prey to Satan. Joshua appears as one polluted, but is purified; he represents the Israel of God, who are all as an unclean thing, till they are washed and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Israel now were free from idolatry, but there were many things amiss in them. There were spiritual enemies warring against them, more dangerous than any neighbouring nations. Christ loathed the filthiness of Joshua's garments, yet did not put him away. Thus God by his grace does with those whom he chooses to be priests to himself. The guilt of sin is taken away by pardoning mercy, and the power of it is broken by renewing grace. Thus Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood, whom he makes kings and priests to our God. Those whom Christ makes spiritual priests, are clothed with the spotless robe of his righteousness, and appear before God in that; and with the graces of his Spirit, which are ornaments to them. The righteousness of saints, both imputed and implanted, is the fine linen, clean and white, with which the bride, the Lamb's wife, is arrayed, Re 19:8. Joshua is restored to former honours and trusts. The crown of the priesthood is put on him. When the Lord designs to restore and revive religion, he stirs up prophets and people to pray for it.</body></html>
