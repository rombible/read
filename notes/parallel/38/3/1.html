Some suppose that it was the interpreting angel who showed this vision; but his duty was to explain, not to present, the visions. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-20.htm">Zechariah 1:20</a> it is the Lord who shows the "four craftsmen." This vision is closely connected with the last. In that it was declared that the Lord would again dwell in Jerusalem, and visit his people with blessings. But to fit them for the presence and favour of Jehovah they must be pure. To this end they must have a holy priesthood to train them in righteous ways, to oppose the attacks of the adversary, and to intercede for them effectually. The removal of their impurity is represented in the fourth vision. <span class="cmt_word">Joshua the high priest</span> (see note on Haggai 1:1). The name is written Joshua in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>, etc. He was the first of the high priests after the Captivity, succeeding, as by hereditary right, his father Josedech, who died in Babylon. For his services in restoring the temple he is praised among great men in Ecclus. 49:12. <span class="cmt_word">Standing before the angel of the Lord</span>. Joshua is the representative of the priesthoood, and through that also of the whole people. The angel of Jehovah (see notes on Zechariah 1:11, 13) is the representative of and endowed with attributes of Jehovah, the Friend and Leader of Israel. The phrase, "standing before," is used in a ministerial sense, as of a servant rendering service to a superior (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6, 8</a>), and a priest or Levite performing his official duties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>) : also, in a judicial sense, of a person appearing before a judge, either as plaintiff (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-2.htm">Numbers 27:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>) or defendant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Many commentators find in this scene a judicial process, Joshua appearing before the angel as before his judge; and Ewald supposes that it adumbrates his actual accusation at the Persian court, The mention of the adversary at the right hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>) is supposed to confirm this interpretation. But it is obvious that the adversary might stand at the right hand, not as a formal accuser in a trial, but in order to resist and hinder Joshua's proceedings; the angel, too, is not represented as sitting on a throne of judgment, but standing by (ver. 5), and there is no further intimation of any judicial process in the vision. It is therefore best to conceive that Joshua is interceding for the people in his official capacity in the presence of the representative of Jehovah. The locality is not specified; it may have been before the altar, which, we know, was built and used at this time. The special mention of his garments implies that he was engaged in official duties in a consecrated spot; but the place is immaterial. <span class="cmt_word">Satan</span>; <span class="accented">the adversary</span>, or <span class="accented">accuser</span>. The personality of Satan is here plainly recognized, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, etc.; Job 2:1, etc., rendered by the LXX. in all these places, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see Appendix B, in Archdeacon Perowne's 'Commentary on Zechariah'). <span class="cmt_word">At his</span> (Joshua's) <span class="cmt_word">right hand.</span> Not as a judicial accuser, but as an enemy to resist his efforts for the good of the people, and to thwart his interests with the angel of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">To resist him;</span> <span class="accented">to act the adversary to him.</span> The verb is cognate to, the noun above. From what follows we must suppose that Satan objects against Joshua both his own personal sin and the transgressions of the people whose burden he bore (comp. ver. 9, where his sin is called "the iniquity of the land," which would include the guilt which had led to the Captivity, their dilatoriness in building the temple, and all their backslidings since the return). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 The angel showed Joshua, the high priest, to Zechariah, in a vision. Guilt and corruption are great discouragements when we stand before God. By the guilt of the sins committed by us, we are liable to the justice of God; by the power of sin that dwells in us, we are hateful to the holiness of God. Even God's Israel are in danger on these accounts; but they have relief from Jesus Christ, who is made of God to us both righteousness and sanctification. Joshua, the high priest, is accused as a criminal, but is justified. When we stand before God, to minister to him, or stand up for God, we must expect to meet all the resistance Satan's subtlety and malice can give. Satan is checked by one that has conquered him, and many times silenced him. Those who belong to Christ, will find him ready to appear for them, when Satan appears most strongly against them. A converted soul is a brand plucked out of the fire by a miracle of free grace, therefore shall not be left a prey to Satan. Joshua appears as one polluted, but is purified; he represents the Israel of God, who are all as an unclean thing, till they are washed and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Israel now were free from idolatry, but there were many things amiss in them. There were spiritual enemies warring against them, more dangerous than any neighbouring nations. Christ loathed the filthiness of Joshua's garments, yet did not put him away. Thus God by his grace does with those whom he chooses to be priests to himself. The guilt of sin is taken away by pardoning mercy, and the power of it is broken by renewing grace. Thus Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood, whom he makes kings and priests to our God. Those whom Christ makes spiritual priests, are clothed with the spotless robe of his righteousness, and appear before God in that; and with the graces of his Spirit, which are ornaments to them. The righteousness of saints, both imputed and implanted, is the fine linen, clean and white, with which the bride, the Lamb's wife, is arrayed, Re 19:8. Joshua is restored to former honours and trusts. The crown of the priesthood is put on him. When the Lord designs to restore and revive religion, he stirs up prophets and people to pray for it.</body></html>
