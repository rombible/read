The LXX. omits the word, continuing the address to the attendant. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">et dixit.</span> So the Syriac and the Targum and some few manuscripts. But the received reading is confirmed, as Dr. Alexander points out, by the change in the mood of the following verb from the imperative to the optative, "let them put," "would that they put." There is nothing incongruous in the prophet thus intervening in his own person. Thus Isaiah, in the midst of a solemn vision, gives vent to his feelings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>), and St. John in the Apocalypse often mingles his own sentiments and actions with what he beheld (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-4.htm">Revelation 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mitre</span> (<span class="accented">tsaniph</span>); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">cidarim.</span> This is not the same word as that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>, etc. (which is <span class="accented">mitsnepheth</span>), for the official head dress of Aaron, though it is probably a synonym for it; and the prophet's wish is to see Joshua not only reinstated in his office and dignity, but found holy also. For the fair linen mitre, or tiara, was that which bore upon its front the golden plate inscribed, "Holiness unto the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>), and therefore showed that he was qualified to intercede for the people. <span class="cmt_word">Stood by.</span> The Angel of Jehovah continued standing in his place, contemplating, sanctioning, and directing what was being done. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 The angel showed Joshua, the high priest, to Zechariah, in a vision. Guilt and corruption are great discouragements when we stand before God. By the guilt of the sins committed by us, we are liable to the justice of God; by the power of sin that dwells in us, we are hateful to the holiness of God. Even God's Israel are in danger on these accounts; but they have relief from Jesus Christ, who is made of God to us both righteousness and sanctification. Joshua, the high priest, is accused as a criminal, but is justified. When we stand before God, to minister to him, or stand up for God, we must expect to meet all the resistance Satan's subtlety and malice can give. Satan is checked by one that has conquered him, and many times silenced him. Those who belong to Christ, will find him ready to appear for them, when Satan appears most strongly against them. A converted soul is a brand plucked out of the fire by a miracle of free grace, therefore shall not be left a prey to Satan. Joshua appears as one polluted, but is purified; he represents the Israel of God, who are all as an unclean thing, till they are washed and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Israel now were free from idolatry, but there were many things amiss in them. There were spiritual enemies warring against them, more dangerous than any neighbouring nations. Christ loathed the filthiness of Joshua's garments, yet did not put him away. Thus God by his grace does with those whom he chooses to be priests to himself. The guilt of sin is taken away by pardoning mercy, and the power of it is broken by renewing grace. Thus Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood, whom he makes kings and priests to our God. Those whom Christ makes spiritual priests, are clothed with the spotless robe of his righteousness, and appear before God in that; and with the graces of his Spirit, which are ornaments to them. The righteousness of saints, both imputed and implanted, is the fine linen, clean and white, with which the bride, the Lamb's wife, is arrayed, Re 19:8. Joshua is restored to former honours and trusts. The crown of the priesthood is put on him. When the Lord designs to restore and revive religion, he stirs up prophets and people to pray for it.</body></html>
