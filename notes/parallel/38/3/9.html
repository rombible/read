the Church is to be firmly established and all iniquity to be abolished. <span class="cmt_word">The stone that I have laid</span> (set) <span class="cmt_word">before Joshua.</span> In the vision a stone is seen lying at the feet of Joshua, either the foundationstone of the temple, say the commentators, or the cornerstone, or the coping; or, as the Talmud testifies, a stone that rose some three fingers' measure above the ground, and upon which the high priest used to set the censer of incense. But it was more probably none of these, but some rough, unhewed block, not yet polished or fitted into its place. What does it represent? Many critics of note answer at once, the Messiah. He who was above called "Branch" is now called the "Stone." And certainly this term in applied unto him in prophetical language, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>; and references are made to the appellation is the New Testament as to a well known title, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>. But there are objections to taking this as the primary sense. As Knabenbauer points out, it is not likely that in one verse the Lord's Servant Branch is said to be destined to be brought forth, and in the next the same is called the stone which is set before Joshua and has to be graven by a hand Divine. Besides, if both terms mean Messiah, we have the very lame conclusion: I will bring Messiah because I have already placed him before Joshua. The stone, too, is represented as somewhat under the management of Joshua, and needing graving and polishing, neither of which facts apply to the Messiah. Putting out of sight other interpretations which are all more or less inadmissible, we shall be safest in considering the stone to represent the theocracy, the spiritual kingdom of Israel, now indeed lying imperfect and unpolished before Joshua, but ordained to become beautiful and extensive and admirable. So Daniel (Daniel 2:35, 45) speaks of the stone cut out of the mountains without hands, which filled the whole earth, a figure of the Church and kingdom of God, small in its beginning, but in the end establishing its rule over the world. <span class="cmt_word">Upon one stone;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "upon the one stone." The stone is termed "one" in contrast with the number seven that follows. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be</span> (are) <span class="cmt_word">seven eyes.</span> Upon this stone the eyes of God are directed in watchful care (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>; and for the phrase, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-12.htm">Jeremiah 39:12</a>). "Seven" is the number of perfection, and may denote here the infinite care which God takes of his Church, even as St. John in the Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>) beheld the Lamb "having seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth." The expression is metaphorical, and we are not to suppose, with Ewald, that the eyes were graven on the stone, or that Zechariah derived his notion from the tenets of Zoroaster or the degrees of rank in the Persian court. There may be an allusion to the seven gifts of the Spirit with which Messiah is anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>), and which animate and strengthen his body, the Church. <span class="cmt_word">I will engrave the graving thereof.</span> As God engraved the tables of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a>). I will out and polish this rough stone to fit it for its place in the temple. The verb is used of the bold engraving and ornamentation of stonework, the finishing which it undergoes to perfect its preparation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-36.htm">1 Kings 7:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-7.htm">2 Chronicles 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-7.htm">2 Chronicles 3:7</a>). Those who regard the stone as typifying the Messiah, see in this clause an intimation of the Passion of Christ, who "was wounded for our transgressions." The LXX. has, "I dig a trench," which Jerome explains of the wounds of Christ on the cross. <span class="cmt_word">I will remove the iniquity of that land.</span> The shaping of the stone involves the bestowal of purity and holiness. God will pardon the inhabitants of the land of Israel, and make them a holy nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-7.htm">Jeremiah 33:7, 8</a>). But the promise stretches far beyond the limits primarily assigned to it. <span class="cmt_word">In one day.</span> The day when Christ died for the sins of men. There is an allusion to the great Day of Atonement, when the high priest went once a year into the holy of holies with the blood of sacrifice. This, however, was an imperfect reconciliation, and had to be repeated annually. "But Christ being come an High Priest of the good things to come... through his own blood entered in once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>) into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption Now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-26</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-10 All whom God calls to any office he finds fit, or makes so. The Lord will cause the sins of the believer to pass away by his sanctifying grace, and will enable him to walk in newness of life. As the promises made to David often pass into promises of the Messiah, so the promises to Joshua look forward to Christ, of whose priesthood Joshua's was a shadow. Whatever trials we pass through, whatever services we perform, our whole dependence must rest on Christ, the Branch of righteousness. He is God's servant, employed in his work, obedient to his will, devoted to his honour and glory. He is the Branch from which all our fruit must be gathered. The eye of his Father was upon him, especially in his sufferings, and when he was buried in the grave, as the foundation-stones are under ground, out of men's sight. But the prophecy rather denotes the attention paid to this precious Corner-stone. All believers, from the beginning, had looked forward to it in the types and predictions. All believers, after Christ's coming, would look to it with faith, hope, and love. Christ shall appear for all his chosen, as the high priest when before the Lord, with the names of all Israel graven in the precious stones of his breastplate. When God gave a remnant to Christ, to be brought through grace to glory, then he engraved this precious stone. By him sin shall be taken away, both the guilt and the dominion of it; he did it in one day, that day in which he suffered and died. What should terrify when sin is taken away? Then nothing can hurt, and we sit down under Christ's shadow with delight, and are sheltered by it. And gospel grace, coming with power, makes men forward to draw others to it.</body></html>
