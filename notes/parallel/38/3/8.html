Joshua is called upon to give all his attention to the important announcement that follows, which promises a very great boon in the future. <span class="cmt_word">Thy fellows that sit before thee</span>. His fellow priests, who took their orders from him and sat with him in council (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>, etc.). These priests were not seen in the vision. Keil considers that the address, to which Joshua's attention is called, begins at "Thou and thy fellows." <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (or, <span class="accented">yea</span>) <span class="cmt_word">they are men wondered at;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;</span>, "men observers of wonders;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quia viri portendentes sunt</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>). The phrase would be better rendered, "men of portent, sign, or type." Revised Version gives, "men which are a sign," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who foreshadow some future events, whose persons, office, duties, typify and look forward to good things to come. <span class="cmt_word">I will bring forth my Servant the BRANCH.</span> This is why they are called typical men, because God is making the antitype to appear. The word rendered "branch" (<span class="accented">tsemach</span>) is translated by the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, which is used in the sense of "shoot" as well as "sunrise" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-10.htm">Ezekiel 17:10</a>), and by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">orientem.</span> So the Syriac and Arabic (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>). Most interpreters rightly see here a reference to the Messiah. Some few have fancied that Zerubbabel and Nehemiah are meant; but the appellation, "my Servant Branch," has already been applied in prophetical language to Messiah, and cannot be distorted to any inferior subject, such as a mere civil ruler. Messiah is often called the Lord's "Servant," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>, etc. And the terms, "Branch," or "Rod," or "Shoot," referring to Messiah, are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>. From the depressed house of David a scion should spring, in whom all that was prophesied concerning the priesthood and kingdom of Israel should find its accomplishment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-10 All whom God calls to any office he finds fit, or makes so. The Lord will cause the sins of the believer to pass away by his sanctifying grace, and will enable him to walk in newness of life. As the promises made to David often pass into promises of the Messiah, so the promises to Joshua look forward to Christ, of whose priesthood Joshua's was a shadow. Whatever trials we pass through, whatever services we perform, our whole dependence must rest on Christ, the Branch of righteousness. He is God's servant, employed in his work, obedient to his will, devoted to his honour and glory. He is the Branch from which all our fruit must be gathered. The eye of his Father was upon him, especially in his sufferings, and when he was buried in the grave, as the foundation-stones are under ground, out of men's sight. But the prophecy rather denotes the attention paid to this precious Corner-stone. All believers, from the beginning, had looked forward to it in the types and predictions. All believers, after Christ's coming, would look to it with faith, hope, and love. Christ shall appear for all his chosen, as the high priest when before the Lord, with the names of all Israel graven in the precious stones of his breastplate. When God gave a remnant to Christ, to be brought through grace to glory, then he engraved this precious stone. By him sin shall be taken away, both the guilt and the dominion of it; he did it in one day, that day in which he suffered and died. What should terrify when sin is taken away? Then nothing can hurt, and we sit down under Christ's shadow with delight, and are sheltered by it. And gospel grace, coming with power, makes men forward to draw others to it.</body></html>
