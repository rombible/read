This fast was instituted in consequence of the murder of Gedaliah, <span class="date">B.C. 587</span>, just seventy years ago, when the greater part of the remnant of the Jews, contrary to the prophet's warning, fled into Egypt to escape the punishment of the crime (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-25.htm">2 Kings 25:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-2.htm">Jeremiah 41:2, 16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Did ye at all fast unto me?</span> It was not by God's command, or to do him honor, that they fasted; not from hearty repentance or sorrow for the sins which had brought ruin upon their city and country; but from vexation at the calamity itself, and in a self-righteous spirit, with some idea of gaining merit by this punishment of the body; and God was not constrained by this formal observance to show them favour. <span class="cmt_word">Even to me.</span> (For the forcible repetition of the pronoun, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-34.htm">Genesis 27:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 If we truly desire to know the will of God in doubtful matters, we must not only consult his word and ministers, but seek his direction by fervent prayer. Those who would know God's mind should consult God's ministers; and, in doubtful cases, ask advice of those whose special business it is to search the Scriptures. The Jews seemed to question whether they ought to continue their fasts, seeing that the city and temple were likely to be finished. The first answer to their inquiry is a sharp reproof of hypocrisy. These fasts were not acceptable to God, unless observed in a better manner, and to better purpose. There was the form of duty, but no life, or soul, or power in it. Holy exercises are to be done to God, looking to his word as our rule, and his glory as our end, seeking to please him and obtain his favour; but self was the centre of all their actions. And it was not enough to weep on fast days; they should have searched the Scriptures of the prophets, that they might have seen what was the ground of God's controversy with their fathers. Whether people are in prosperity or adversity, they must be called upon to leave their sins, and to do their duty.</body></html>
