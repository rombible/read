here it means the Bethelites (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-10.htm">1 Samuel 5:10, 11</a>). Weeping is the accompaniment of fasting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12</a>). This fast in the fifth month, the month of Ab, had been established in memory of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. The temple was burnt on the ninth or tenth of the month (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12, 13</a>). The only fast-day enjoined by the Law of Moses was the great Day of Atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month, Ethanim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-26.htm">Leviticus 23:26</a>, etc.). But the Jews added others in memory of certain national events (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>, etc.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a> mention is made of four extraordinary fasts instituted and observed during the Captivity, viz. on the ninth day of the fourth month, in memory of the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; in the fifth month, in remembrance of the burning of the temple and city; in the seventh month, in consequence of the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-1.htm">Jeremiah 41:1, 2</a>); and in the tenth month, in memory of the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (see note on ch. 8:19). <span class="cmt_word">Separating myself.</span> Abstaining from food and pleasure.

There is, perhaps, some Pharisaical complacency in this assertion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 If we truly desire to know the will of God in doubtful matters, we must not only consult his word and ministers, but seek his direction by fervent prayer. Those who would know God's mind should consult God's ministers; and, in doubtful cases, ask advice of those whose special business it is to search the Scriptures. The Jews seemed to question whether they ought to continue their fasts, seeing that the city and temple were likely to be finished. The first answer to their inquiry is a sharp reproof of hypocrisy. These fasts were not acceptable to God, unless observed in a better manner, and to better purpose. There was the form of duty, but no life, or soul, or power in it. Holy exercises are to be done to God, looking to his word as our rule, and his glory as our end, seeking to please him and obtain his favour; but self was the centre of all their actions. And it was not enough to weep on fast days; they should have searched the Scriptures of the prophets, that they might have seen what was the ground of God's controversy with their fathers. Whether people are in prosperity or adversity, they must be called upon to leave their sins, and to do their duty.</body></html>
