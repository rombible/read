no message from God could find entrance; and this from their wilful obstinacy. The word rendered "adamant," <span class="accented">shamir</span>, probably means "diamond," a stone so hard, says Jerome, as to break all metals to pieces, but to be itself broken by none; hence it is called <span class="accented">adamas</span>, "unconquerable." Ezekiel (Ezekiel 3:9) notes that it is harder than flint (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>).

The duties required are, not keeping fasts and offering sacrifices, but doing justly and loving mercy, which tend to the public welfare and peace. The law of God lays restraint upon the heart. But they filled their minds with prejudices against the word of God. Nothing is harder than the heart of a presumptuous sinner. See the fatal consequences of this to their fathers. Great sins against the Lord of hosts, bring great wrath from his power, which cannot be resisted. Sin, if regarded in the heart, will certainly spoil the success of prayer. The Lord always hears the cry of the broken-hearted penitent; yet all who die impenitent and unbelieving, will find no remedy or refuge from miseries which while here they despised and defied, but which they then will not be able to bear.</body></html>
