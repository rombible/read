the LXX. gives, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "And Sarasar and Arbescer the king and his men sent to Bethel" - which is far from clear. But the temple is never called <span class="accented">Beth-el</span>, while a mission to the town Bethel would be unmeaning. So "Bethel" is to be taken as the subject of the sentence, thus: "Now Bethel (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> they of Bethel) sent." The persons named may be taken either as the deputation or as the persons meant by "they of Bethel." The former seems most likely to be intended. The Bethelites sent these men to Jerusalem to make the inquiry. The exiles returned each to his own city, as we read in Ezra it.; among them were many people of Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-32.htm">Nehemiah 7:32</a>), which town they rebuilt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>). They seem to have tacitly acquiesced in the spiritual supremacy of Jerusalem, notwithstanding the associations Connected with their own city. <span class="cmt_word">Sherezer</span>. The names of the deputies are Assyrian; they seem to have retained them on their return. <span class="accented">Sherezer</span>, equivalent to Assyrian <span class="accented">Sar-usur</span> or <span class="accented">Asur-sar-usur</span>, "Asur protect the King," is the name borne by a sen of Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Regem-melech</span>; "Friend of the King." The first half of the word is probably Assyrian (see Schrader, 'Die Keilinschr. und Alt. Test.,' pp. 206, 417). <span class="cmt_word">And their men</span>. Certain persons associated with them in the business. <span class="cmt_word">To pray before the Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to stroke the face of the</span> Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-21.htm">Zechariah 8:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>); so Latin, <span class="accented">mulcere caput.</span> Hence it means, "to entreat the favour of God" for their city. This was one object of their mission. The other purpose is mentioned in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 If we truly desire to know the will of God in doubtful matters, we must not only consult his word and ministers, but seek his direction by fervent prayer. Those who would know God's mind should consult God's ministers; and, in doubtful cases, ask advice of those whose special business it is to search the Scriptures. The Jews seemed to question whether they ought to continue their fasts, seeing that the city and temple were likely to be finished. The first answer to their inquiry is a sharp reproof of hypocrisy. These fasts were not acceptable to God, unless observed in a better manner, and to better purpose. There was the form of duty, but no life, or soul, or power in it. Holy exercises are to be done to God, looking to his word as our rule, and his glory as our end, seeking to please him and obtain his favour; but self was the centre of all their actions. And it was not enough to weep on fast days; they should have searched the Scriptures of the prophets, that they might have seen what was the ground of God's controversy with their fathers. Whether people are in prosperity or adversity, they must be called upon to leave their sins, and to do their duty.</body></html>
