THE ANSWER TO A QUESTION CONCERNING THE OBSERVANCE OF CERTAIN FASTS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - &sect; 1<span class="accented">. A deputation comes from Bethel to ask whether a fast instituted in memory of the calamity of Jerusalem was still to be observed.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the fourth year of King Darius.</span> This happened, then, <span class="date">B.C. 518</span>, nearly two years after the visions had occurred (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7</a>). In two years more the temple was finished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a>), and the work of rebuilding was now proceeding vigorously; it seemed a fit opportunity for inquiring whether, in this period of comparative prosperity and success, it behoved the people to continue the fast appointed in sadder times. <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord came.</span> This is the usual formula for introducing a revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>), but it is here placed in a peculiar position, dividing the date into two parts. Keil connects the last clause, which gives the day of the month, with the next verse; but this is against the traditional accentuation, and is not required by the wording of ver. 2. The prophet first gives the date generally when the word came to him, and then defines it more accurately. <span class="cmt_word">Chisleu</span>; <span class="accented">Chislev</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>). This month corresponded to parts of November and December. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-7 If we truly desire to know the will of God in doubtful matters, we must not only consult his word and ministers, but seek his direction by fervent prayer. Those who would know God's mind should consult God's ministers; and, in doubtful cases, ask advice of those whose special business it is to search the Scriptures. The Jews seemed to question whether they ought to continue their fasts, seeing that the city and temple were likely to be finished. The first answer to their inquiry is a sharp reproof of hypocrisy. These fasts were not acceptable to God, unless observed in a better manner, and to better purpose. There was the form of duty, but no life, or soul, or power in it. Holy exercises are to be done to God, looking to his word as our rule, and his glory as our end, seeking to please him and obtain his favour; but self was the centre of all their actions. And it was not enough to weep on fast days; they should have searched the Scriptures of the prophets, that they might have seen what was the ground of God's controversy with their fathers. Whether people are in prosperity or adversity, they must be called upon to leave their sins, and to do their duty.</body></html>
