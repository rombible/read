<span class="accented">in the night</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the night of the twenty-fourth day (ver. 7). The visions were seen in this one night at short intervals. There is nothing to make one suppose that they came in dreams (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>). The prophet is awake, but whether he sees these scenes with his bodily eyes, or was rapt in ecstasy, cannot be decided. <span class="cmt_word">A man riding upon a red horse.</span> This is the Angel of Jehovah, mentioned again in ver. 10 and in ver. 11, in both of which places the description, "that stood among the myrtle trees," serves to identify him. He is different from the interpreting angel, and is the leader of the company of horsemen that follow him. Keil and Wright consider that the rider on the red horse cannot be identified with the Angel of Jehovah, because otherwise he would have been represented as standing opposite to the other horsemen to receive the information which they brought him, and they would not have been spoken of as "behind" hint. But the expression in ver. 8 may mean merely that the prophet sets his eyes first on the leader and then on the attendants. Or in ver. 10 he is the spokesman who begins the account of the riders' doings, which these themselves complete in ver. 11. Thus there are in the scene only <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the prophet; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the angel rider and his attendants; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the interpreting angel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The red colour of the horse is supposed to represent war and bloodshed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>; but this seems unsuitable in this piece, where nothing of the kind is intimated, but rather the contrary (ver. 11). It is, indeed, impossible to affix any satisfactory explanation to the colour. If, as we may well suppose, this personage is the Angel of the covenant, who was the leader and guide of the Israelites (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>), his standing in the valley among the myrtles may represent the depressed and humbled condition of the chosen people, which yet was well pleasing unto God, like the sweet scent of odoriferous myrtles is agreeable to men. <span class="cmt_word">The myrtle trees.</span> The myrtle is indigenous in the hilly regions of Northern Palestine, and is still seen in the glens near Jerusalem, though no longer on the Mount of Olives, where the returned captives found it when celebrating their first Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the bottom;</span> <span class="accented">the valley.</span> Myrtles love such places. "Amantes littora myrtos" (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:124). The term would suit the valley of the Kidron. Others render, "the shady place," or "the tabernacle," but not so appropriately. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> [Alex., 860] <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "between the shady mountains." The Greek translators seem to have borrowed their reading from ch. 6, where the chariots issue from between two mountains of brass. <span class="cmt_word">Behind him were them red horses;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> horses mounted by riders (ver. 11). Speckled. It is not clear what colour is meant by this word. The Revised Version gives <span class="accented">sorrel</span>; Wright, "bay or chestnut;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: "dapple-grey and spotted;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">varii.</span> The Septuagint Version is probably a double rendering. The word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, where it is applied to the tendrils of the vitae. What is intended by the different colours of the horses is a matter of great dispute, and cannot be known. There is some reason for considering that they represent the world powers at this particular period - the Babylonian, the Medo-Persian, the Greek; three of those concerning which Daniel prophesied; the fourth, the Roman, not having yet come in view. The notion of tutelary angels, presiding over countries, was familiar to the Hebrew mind (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12, 13, 20, 21</a>). These horsemen are evidently not post couriers, but warriors on military service. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-17 The prophet saw a dark, shady grove, hidden by hills. This represented the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.</body></html>
