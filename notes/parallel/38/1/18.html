The prophet had been told that the hostile nations should be punished and scattered; he now is shown this threat being executed. <span class="cmt_word">Four horns,</span> belching to four beasts but dimly seen or wholly invisible. Horns are symbols of strength and power (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). Here they mean powers hostile to Israel, and the number "four" (the symbol of completeness) points to the four winds from which they come, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from every side. In the Hebrew ch. 2. begins at this verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 The enemies of the church threaten to cut off the name of Israel. They are horns, emblems of power, strength, and violence. The prophet saw them so formidable that he began to despair of the safety of every good man, and the success of every good work; but the Lord showed him four workmen empowered to cut off these horns. With an eye of sense we see the power of the enemies of the church; look which way we will, the world shows us that; but it is only with an eye of faith that we see it safe. The Lord shows us that. When God has work to do, he will raise up some to do it, and others to defend it, and to protect those employed in doing it. What cause there is to look up in love and praise to the holy and eternal Spirit, who has the same care over the present and eternal interests of believers, by the holy word bringing the church to know the wonderful things of salvation!</body></html>
