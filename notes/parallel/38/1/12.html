He answered the feeling in the prophet's mind, the unexpressed longing of his heart. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord of hosts.</span> The angel is the intercessor for the people. So Christ prays to the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17.htm">John 17</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">How long wilt thou not have mercy,</span> etc.? He prays that the weary waiting for deliverance may speedily come to an end, and Jerusalem be restored, and Judaea be again inhabited by a happy population. <span class="cmt_word">These three score and ten years.</span> The predicted seventy years of captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) were past; it was time that the punishment should cease. There are two computations of this period. The first dates from the first capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, <span class="date">B.C. 606</span>, when Judaea was made tributary to Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-6.htm">2 Chronicles 36:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>, etc.), unto the return of the company of exiles under Zerubbabel, <span class="date">B.C. 536</span>; the second dates from the final destruction of Jerusalem, <span class="date">B.C. 588</span>, unto the second year of Darius, <span class="date">B.C. 519</span>, when Zechariah saw these visions. However reckoned, the dark period was now over; might they not now expect the commotion among the nations which was to precede their own restitution? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-17 The prophet saw a dark, shady grove, hidden by hills. This represented the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.</body></html>
