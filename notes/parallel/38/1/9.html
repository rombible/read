(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-8.htm">Amos 7:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That talked with me;</span> literally, as the LXX. and Vulgate, <span class="accented">that spake in me.</span> So vers. 13, 14, and in the following visions. Hence some regard the expression as intimating a communication berne inwardly to the soul without the aid of external organs, or that the angel overpowered and influenced the prophet as the evil spirit possessed the demoniac. But the same term is used, as Dr. Wright points out, in the sense of to commune with a person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-39.htm">1 Samuel 25:39</a>), and to speak to a person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>). It may, however, be that the angel of the Lord presented matters objectively, and the prophet's own angel interpreted subjectively. But the Authorized Version is probably correct. <span class="cmt_word">I will show thee.</span> This he does through the chief angel (ver. 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-17 The prophet saw a dark, shady grove, hidden by hills. This represented the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.</body></html>
