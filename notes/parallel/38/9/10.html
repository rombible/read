The Jews seem to have used war chariots from the time of Solomon, who, we are told, had fourteen hundred of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim...Jerusalem.</span> The former term denotes the kingdom of the ten tribes; the latter, that of Judah; the two together comprising the whole Israelite nation. From the use of these terms here it cannot be concluded that the author wrote at a time when the two kingdoms existed side by side. In the first place, the description of the whole people is given poetically, and must not be taken to have more significance than is intended; and secondly, in ch. 8:13, which is confessedly post-exilian, the "house of Judah," and the "house of Israel" are distinguished. Dr. Cheyne notes, too, that in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:15-28), who prophesied during the Captivity, the ten tribes are distinguished by the name of Ephraim, and pertinently asks why such term may not be also used by one who wrote after the Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">The battle bow stands for all weapons of war.</span> That Messiah's kingdom should be peaceful and peace-bringing, see the prophecies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4-7</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He shall speak peace unto the heathen.</span> He will extend this peace to all the world, teaching the heathen to receive his spiritual rule, to compose their differences, to lay aside their arms, and live as one united family (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From sea even to sea.</span> Geographically, the phrase means from the Dead Sea on the east to the Mediterranean on the west, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>, from whence our passage is derived. Poetically, an Eastern sea, perhaps, is supposed to bound that side of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">From the river even to the ends of the earth.</span> From the Enphrates unto the utmost limits of the world (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-12.htm">Amos 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>). Both expressions obtain an unlimited significance, and show the universal extent of Messiah's kingdom; for in him, according to the promise made to Abraham, all the families of the earth should be blessed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:9-17 The prophet breaks forth into a joyful representation of the coming of the Messiah, of whom the ancient Jews explained this prophecy. He took the character of their King, when he entered Jerusalem amidst the hosannas of the multitude. But his kingdom is a spiritual kingdom. It shall not be advanced by outward force or carnal weapons. His gospel shall be preached to the world, and be received among the heathen. A sinful state is a state of bondage; it is a pit, or dungeon, in which there is no water, no comfort; and we are all by nature prisoners in this pit. Through the precious blood of Christ, many prisoners of Satan have been set at liberty from the horrible pit in which they must otherwise have perished, without hope or comfort. While we admire Him, let us seek that his holiness and truth may be shown in our own spirits and conduct. These promises have accomplishment in the spiritual blessings of the gospel which we enjoy by Jesus Christ. As the deliverance of the Jews was typical of redemption by Christ, so this invitation speaks to all the language of the gospel call. Sinners are prisoners, but prisoners of hope; their case is sad, but not desperate; for there is hope in Israel concerning them. Christ is a Strong-hold, a strong Tower, in whom believers are safe from the fear of the wrath of God, the curse of the law, and the assaults of spiritual enemies. To him we must turn with lively faith; to him we must flee, and trust in his name under all trials and sufferings. It is here promised that the Lord would deliver his people. This passage also refers to the apostles, and the preachers of the gospel in the early ages. God was evidently with them; his words from their lips pierced the hearts and consciences of the hearers. They were wondrously defended in persecution, and were filled with the influences of the Holy Spirit. They were saved by the Good Shepherd as his flock, and honoured as jewels of his crown. The gifts, graces, and consolations of the Spirit, poured forth on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2 and in succeeding times, are represented. Sharp have been, and still will be, the conflicts of Zion's sons, but their God will give them success. The more we are employed, and satisfied with his goodness, the more we shall admire the beauty revealed in the Redeemer. Whatever gifts God bestows on us, we must serve him cheerfully with them; and, when refreshed with blessings, we must say, How great is his goodness!</body></html>
