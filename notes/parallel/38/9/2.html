The Authorized Version probably means that Hamath shall be the companion of Damascus in punishment. (For Hamath, see note on Amos 6:2.) These Syrian towns, as well as those below in Phoenicia and Philistia, shall be visited, because they were all once included in the territory promised to Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>l; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). The judgment was inflicted by Alexander the Great after the battle of Issus, <span class="date">B.C. 333</span>, when Damascus was betrayed into his hands and plundered of all its enormous treasures. <span class="cmt_word">Tyrus and Zidon.</span> Tyre was taken after a siege of seven months, its walls were demolished, its houses burnt, ten thousand of its defenders were massacred, the women and children sold as slaves; and it never rose to greatness again. Zidon, originally the chief city of the country, had long been eclipsed by its daughter, Tyre: it submitted to Alexander without a struggle. <span class="cmt_word">Though it be very wise;</span> or, <span class="accented">because she is very wise.</span> The pronoun refers to Tyre, the mention of Zidon being, as it were, parenthetical. In spite of, or because of, its boasted wisdom, Tyre should suffer heavy punishment. The wisdom of Tyre is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3, 4</a>. Wright, as the LXX., makes the clause refer to both cities, "though they be very wise." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Assum pserunt quippe sibi sapientiam valde.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-8 Here are judgements foretold on several nations. While the Macedonians and Alexander's successors were in warfare in these countries, the Lord promised to protect his people. God's house lies in the midst of an enemy's country; his church is as a lily among thorns. God's power and goodness are seen in her special preservation. The Lord encamps about his church, and while armies of proud opposers shall pass by and return, his eyes watch over her, so that they cannot prevail, and shortly the time will come when no exactor shall pass by her any more.</body></html>
