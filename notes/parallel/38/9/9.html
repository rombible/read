2. <span class="accented">Then shall the righteous King come to Zion in lowly fashion, and inaugurate a kingdom of peace.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The prophet invites Jerusalem to rejoice at the coming of the promised salvation in the Person of her King; no mighty earthly potentate and conqueror, like Alexander the Great, but one of different fashion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy King cometh unto thee.</span> St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>) and St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-15.htm">John 12:15</a>) see a fulfilment of this prophecy in Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem on the first day of the week in which he was crucified. All attempts to disprove the Messianic import of this passage have been unavailing. Even critics who refer this part of Zechariah (ch. 9-11.) to an unknown author writing in the time of Hezekiah, allow that it is replete with Messianic ideas, and can be applied to no hero of Jewish story or event of Jewish history. There is no other "King" of Israel to whom it can refer. Our blessed Lord himself, by his abnormal actions on Palm Sunday, plainly assumed the part of the predicted King, and meant the people to recognize in him the promised Messiah (see the full discussion of the subject in Dr. Pusey's notes, pp. 556, etc.). <span class="accented">Thy King.</span> A king of thine own race, no stranger, but one predestined for thee. He who was foretold by all the prophets, who was to occupy the throne of David, and reign forever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-1.htm">Psalm 45:1, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>). <span class="accented">Unto thee</span>.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">salvator</span>; so the Syriac and Chaldee. The genius of the language requires the participle to be taken passively, as it is in two other passages where it occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>). The context has seemed to some to demand that it be understood in an active sense, thus contrasting him who came to save with the haughty Grecian conqueror, whose progress was marked by bloodshed. But the usual meaning of the word affords a satisfactory sense. The King who comes is "saved," endowed with salvation, either as being protected and upheld by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1, 2, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>), or as being victorious and so able to aid his people. In this latter view, the active sense is included in the passive. His own deliverance is a sure sign of the deliverance of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Lowly</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "meek;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">pauper</span> - meek and lowly, as Christ himself says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>),far removed from warlike pomp and worldly greatness. The word is also rendered "afflicted," and would then be in accordance with the description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-53:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Riding upon an ass.</span> In illustration of his poor or afflicted estate; it is this, and not merely the peace. fulness of his reign, that is meant by this symbolical action, as we see by the following clause, where the youthfulness of the animal is the point enforced. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="accented">even, and that</span>) <span class="cmt_word">upon a colt the foal of an ass;</span> such as she asses bear, and one not trained; as the evangelist says, "whereon never man sat." Christ sat upon the foal. In old times judges and men of distinction rode upon asses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>); but from Solomon's days the horse had been used, not only in war, but on all state occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>); and the number of horses brought back on the return from Babylon is specially mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-66.htm">Ezra 2:66</a>). So to predicate of a King that he would come to his capital riding, not on a war horse, but on a young, unbroken ass, showed at once that he himself was not to be considered a victorious general or a worldly potentate, and that his kingdom was not to be won or maintained by carnal arms. This is signified more fully in the following verse, which describes the character and extent of Messiah's kingdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:9-17 The prophet breaks forth into a joyful representation of the coming of the Messiah, of whom the ancient Jews explained this prophecy. He took the character of their King, when he entered Jerusalem amidst the hosannas of the multitude. But his kingdom is a spiritual kingdom. It shall not be advanced by outward force or carnal weapons. His gospel shall be preached to the world, and be received among the heathen. A sinful state is a state of bondage; it is a pit, or dungeon, in which there is no water, no comfort; and we are all by nature prisoners in this pit. Through the precious blood of Christ, many prisoners of Satan have been set at liberty from the horrible pit in which they must otherwise have perished, without hope or comfort. While we admire Him, let us seek that his holiness and truth may be shown in our own spirits and conduct. These promises have accomplishment in the spiritual blessings of the gospel which we enjoy by Jesus Christ. As the deliverance of the Jews was typical of redemption by Christ, so this invitation speaks to all the language of the gospel call. Sinners are prisoners, but prisoners of hope; their case is sad, but not desperate; for there is hope in Israel concerning them. Christ is a Strong-hold, a strong Tower, in whom believers are safe from the fear of the wrath of God, the curse of the law, and the assaults of spiritual enemies. To him we must turn with lively faith; to him we must flee, and trust in his name under all trials and sufferings. It is here promised that the Lord would deliver his people. This passage also refers to the apostles, and the preachers of the gospel in the early ages. God was evidently with them; his words from their lips pierced the hearts and consciences of the hearers. They were wondrously defended in persecution, and were filled with the influences of the Holy Spirit. They were saved by the Good Shepherd as his flock, and honoured as jewels of his crown. The gifts, graces, and consolations of the Spirit, poured forth on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2 and in succeeding times, are represented. Sharp have been, and still will be, the conflicts of Zion's sons, but their God will give them success. The more we are employed, and satisfied with his goodness, the more we shall admire the beauty revealed in the Redeemer. Whatever gifts God bestows on us, we must serve him cheerfully with them; and, when refreshed with blessings, we must say, How great is his goodness!</body></html>
