But Assyrian inscriptions have cleared away the difficulty, and shown that it was the name of a city and district near Damascus, called in the monuments <span class="accented">Hatarakha</span> or <span class="accented">Hatarika</span> (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr. und das Alt. Test,' p. 453). Expeditions against this place are mentioned as occurring in various years, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <span class="date">B.C. 772</span>. 765, 755 (see G. Smith, 'Assyrian Canon,' pp. 46, etc., 63; 'Records of the Past,' 5:46; Schrader, pp. 482, 484, etc., 2nd edit.). <span class="cmt_word">Damascus shall be the rest thereof.</span> The "burden" shall light upon Damascus in wrath, and settle there (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>). This district should be the first to suffer. The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "In the land of Sedrach and Damascus is his sacrifice." <span class="cmt_word">When the eyes of man,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">for to Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">is</span>, or <span class="accented">will be</span>) <span class="accented">the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel.</span> This gives the reason why Hadrach and Damascus are thus united. Because Jehovah has his eye on men and on Israel. Septuagint, "because the Lord looketh upon men" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>; and ver. 8 below). We may then translate, "For to Jehovah is an eye over man," etc. He sees their evil doings and their oppression of Israel, and therefore the judgment falls upon them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>). The Authorized Version intimates a conversion of the Gentiles, of which, however, the context says nothing: and there is no sense in saying that judgment shall fall upon a particular nation when, or because, the eyes of all men look to the Lord. Wright explains thus: When the wrath of God falls on Damascus, the eyes of the heathen, as well as those of Israel, will look to the Lord, and they will marvel at the judgment and the close fulfilment of the prediction. This would be a very sound and probable exposition of the passage if the expression, "the eye of man being towards Jehovah," can mean that man marvels at his doings. <span class="cmt_word">All the tribes of Israel.</span> God watches over them to guard them from evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-5.htm">Ezra 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-8 Here are judgements foretold on several nations. While the Macedonians and Alexander's successors were in warfare in these countries, the Lord promised to protect his people. God's house lies in the midst of an enemy's country; his church is as a lily among thorns. God's power and goodness are seen in her special preservation. The Lord encamps about his church, and while armies of proud opposers shall pass by and return, his eyes watch over her, so that they cannot prevail, and shortly the time will come when no exactor shall pass by her any more.</body></html>
