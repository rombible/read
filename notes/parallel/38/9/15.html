There are numerous examples, in the Books of Maccabees, of God's special interposition in his people's favour, and thus far and in part fulfilling this prophecy (see 1 Macc. 3:16-24 1 Macc. 4:6-16 1 Macc. 7:40-50; 2 Macc. 2:21, 22 2Macc. 3:24, etc.; 5:2-4; 11:8; 12:11,15, 22, 28, 37; 15:7, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They shall devour.</span> The prophet seems to have had in view <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>, where Israel is compared to a lion, eating of the prey and drinking the blood of the slain. So here he says they shall "devour," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the flesh of their enemies (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Subdue with sling stones.</span> So the Vulgate, and virtually the Septuagint, taking the case of the noun as instrumental; but it is best to take it as accusative of the object, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, "They shall tread down the stones of the sling." The "slingstones" are the enemies, as in the next verse "the stones of a crown" are the Jews; and the sentence means that the Jews shall tread their enemies underfoot like spent slingstones, which are of no account. Or it may signify simply and without metaphor that they shall despise the enemies' missiles, which shall fall harmless among them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-28.htm">Job 41:28, 29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall drink</span> the blood of the slain, like lions. <span class="cmt_word">Make a noise.</span> As men exhilarated with wine. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Bibentes inebriabuntur quasi a vino</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be filled like bowls.</span> They shall be filled with blood like the sacrificial vessels in which the blood of victims was received (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The corners of the altar.</span> The blood was also sprinkled on the corners or sides of the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2</a>). There may be included the notion that the war against God's enemies was a sacred war, and accepted by him as a sacrifice. In the Maccabean struggle the bloodshed was often very considerable (see 1 Macc. 7:32, 46 1 Macc. 11:47; 2 Macc. 8:30 2Macc. 10:17, 23, 31, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:9-17 The prophet breaks forth into a joyful representation of the coming of the Messiah, of whom the ancient Jews explained this prophecy. He took the character of their King, when he entered Jerusalem amidst the hosannas of the multitude. But his kingdom is a spiritual kingdom. It shall not be advanced by outward force or carnal weapons. His gospel shall be preached to the world, and be received among the heathen. A sinful state is a state of bondage; it is a pit, or dungeon, in which there is no water, no comfort; and we are all by nature prisoners in this pit. Through the precious blood of Christ, many prisoners of Satan have been set at liberty from the horrible pit in which they must otherwise have perished, without hope or comfort. While we admire Him, let us seek that his holiness and truth may be shown in our own spirits and conduct. These promises have accomplishment in the spiritual blessings of the gospel which we enjoy by Jesus Christ. As the deliverance of the Jews was typical of redemption by Christ, so this invitation speaks to all the language of the gospel call. Sinners are prisoners, but prisoners of hope; their case is sad, but not desperate; for there is hope in Israel concerning them. Christ is a Strong-hold, a strong Tower, in whom believers are safe from the fear of the wrath of God, the curse of the law, and the assaults of spiritual enemies. To him we must turn with lively faith; to him we must flee, and trust in his name under all trials and sufferings. It is here promised that the Lord would deliver his people. This passage also refers to the apostles, and the preachers of the gospel in the early ages. God was evidently with them; his words from their lips pierced the hearts and consciences of the hearers. They were wondrously defended in persecution, and were filled with the influences of the Holy Spirit. They were saved by the Good Shepherd as his flock, and honoured as jewels of his crown. The gifts, graces, and consolations of the Spirit, poured forth on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2 and in succeeding times, are represented. Sharp have been, and still will be, the conflicts of Zion's sons, but their God will give them success. The more we are employed, and satisfied with his goodness, the more we shall admire the beauty revealed in the Redeemer. Whatever gifts God bestows on us, we must serve him cheerfully with them; and, when refreshed with blessings, we must say, How great is his goodness!</body></html>
