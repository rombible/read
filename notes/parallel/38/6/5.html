It was a familiar symbol to the Jews. The winds are often introduced in executing God's will on sinners (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which go forth from standing before the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>). The winds are supposed to be God's servants, waiting his pleasure to be sent forth on his errands. The Septuagint and Vulgate translate, "which go forth to stand before the Lord." This denotes merely their usual obedience; but the text implies that the prophet sees them moving from their usual expectant attitude, and hastening forth to do God's commands. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 This vision may represent the ways of Providence in the government of this lower world. Whatever the providences of God about us are, as to public or private affairs, we should see them all as coming from between the mountains of brass, the immoveable counsels and decrees of God; and therefore reckon it as much our folly to quarrel with them, as it is our duty to submit to them. His providences move swiftly and strongly as chariots, but all are directed and governed by his infinite wisdom and sovereign will. The red horses signify war and bloodshed. The black, signify the dismal consequences of war, famines, pestilences, and desolations. The white, signify the return of comfort, peace, and prosperity. The mixed colour, signify events of different complexions, a day of prosperity and a day of adversity. The angels go forth as messengers of God's counsels, and ministers of his justice and mercy. And the secret motions and impulses upon the spirits of men, by which the designs of Providence are carried on, are these four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from God, and fulfil what the God of the spirits of all flesh appoints. All the events which take place in the world spring from the unchangeable counsels of the Lord, which are formed in unerring wisdom, perfect justice, truth, and goodness; and from history it is found that events happened about the period when this vision was sent to the prophet, which seem referred to therein.</body></html>
