Messiah shall have regal majesty. Compare the many passages where the glory of Christ is spoken of; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Shall sit and rule upon his throne</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>). Thus Christ says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be a Priest upon his throne;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "There shall be a Priest upon his right hand." The Authorized Version is doubtless correct, as the clause is intended to declare that Messiah should, like Melchizedek, combine the offices of Priest and King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6, 10</a>). The counsel of peace shall be between them both. The two offices or dignities are meant, which are combined in one person. The Messiah, in his two offices of Priest and King, has one common design, to bring peace to his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>, where see note). Other interpretations are unsuitable. Thus: There shall be harmony between Joshua and Zerubbabel; but the two are nowhere mentioned together in the paragraph, and, indeed, the statement would be superfluous. There shall be perfect concord between the two offices; but a person is spoken cf. not an abstraction. Others explain the "counsel of peace" to be between Jews and Gentiles, or the returned and the exiled Jews; but neither of these have been named. Pusey takes it to mean, "between the Father and the Son;" but there is nothing in the passage to lead to this. Kuabenhauer expounds it of those who alone are mentioned in the text, Messiah and Joshua, seeing in it an exhortation to the latter to make the type correspond to the Antitype, so that all may see that there is perfect harmony between them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-15 Some Jews from Babylon brought an offering to the house of God. Those who cannot forward a good work by their persons, must, as they are able, forward it by their purses: if some find hands, let others fill them. Crowns are to be made, and put upon the head of Joshua. The sign was used, to make the promise more noticed, that God will, in the fulness of time, raise up a great High Priest, like Joshua, who is but the figure of one that is to come. Christ is not only the Foundation, but the Founder of this temple, by his Spirit and grace. Glory is a burden, but not too heavy for Him to bear who upholds all things. The cross was His glory, and he bore that; so is the crown an exceeding weight of glory, and he bears that. The counsel of peace should be between the priest and the throne, between the priestly and kingly offices of Jesus Christ. The peace and welfare of the gospel church, and of all believers, shall be wrought, though not by two several persons, yet by two several offices meeting in one; Christ, purchasing all peace by his priesthood, maintaining and defending it by his kingdom. The crowns used in this solemnity must be kept in the temple, as evidence of this promise of the Messiah. Let us not think of separating what God has joined in his counsel of peace. We cannot come to God by Christ as our Priest, if we refuse to have him rule over us as our King. We have no real ground to think our peace is made with God, unless we try to keep his commandments.</body></html>
