The word rendered "talent" (<span class="accented">kikkar</span>) denotes a circle. It is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10, 12</a>, for the tract of country of which the Jordan was the centre, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a> for a round loaf. Here it means a disc or circular plate which formed the cover of the round shaped ephah. In the next verse it is called, "the weight of lead." <span class="cmt_word">And this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah;</span> <span class="accented">and there was a woman sitting</span>, etc. When the leaden lid was raised one woman (<span class="accented">mulier una</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) was seen in the measure. She is called "one," as uniting and concentrating in her person all sinners and all sins. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-11 In this vision the prophet sees an ephah, something in the shape of a corn measure. This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling the measure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be delivered into the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The woman sitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church and nation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon the sinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seems to mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure of their iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel. Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carried away to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should be hurried out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, as they had been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, and their sufferings shall continue far longer than in their late captivity. Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upon their own unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measure fills.</body></html>
