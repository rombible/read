(For the curse of fled upon guilty nations, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-6.htm">Isaiah 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Earth</span>; <span class="accented">land</span>; for Judaea is meant. The curse was ready to fall on all who might come under it by their transgressions. This would be a warning also to exterior nations. <span class="cmt_word">Every one that stealeth...every one that sweareth</span>. Thieves and perjurers are especially mentioned as incurring the curse. Perjury is a chief offence in one table of the Law, theft in the other; so these sins may stand for all offences against the Decalogue (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>, etc.). But probably they are named because they were particularly rife among the returned Jews. Daring their long sojourn in Babylon they had engaged in commercial pursuits and had fallen into the lax morality which such occupations often engender. These bad habits they had brought with them and practised in their new home (comp. ch. 8:17, and note there). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be out off as on this side according to it;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">shall be purged out on the one side</span> (margin, <span class="accented">from hence</span>) <span class="accented">according to it</span>; Ewald, "driven hence like it." The reference is to the two sides of the roll, answering to the two tables of the Decalogue. Sinners shall be <span class="accented">i.e.</span> utterly consumed, cleansed away, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the tenor of the roll. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">judicabitur</span>; the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> "shall be punished unto death." That sweareth; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> falsely, as is plain from ver. 4; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "every perjurer." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are rolls, in which God has written the great things of his law and gospel; they are flying rolls. God's word runs very swiftly, Ps 147:15. This flying roll contains a declaration of the righteous wrath of God against sinners. Oh that we saw with an eye of faith the flying roll of God's curse hanging over the guilty world as a thick cloud, not only keeping off the sunbeams of God's favour, but big with thunders, lightnings, and storms, ready to destroy them! How welcome then would the tidings of a Saviour be, who came to redeem us from the curse of the law, being himself made a curse for us! Sin is the ruin of houses and families; especially the doing hurt to others and false witness. Who knows the power of God's anger? God's curse cannot be kept out by bars or locks. While one part of the curse of God ruins the substance of the sinner, another part will rest on the soul, and sink it to everlasting punishment. All are transgressors of the law, so we cannot escape this wrath of God, except we flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us in the gospel.</body></html>
