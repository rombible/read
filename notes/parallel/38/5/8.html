It is very common to find backsliding Israel represented as a faithless and adulterous woman (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>; and the parable of the two women in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">He cast it;</span> <span class="accented">her</span> - the woman. As the woman rose, or tried to rise, from the ephah, the angel flung her down into it. It is possible, as some commentators suppose, that the ephah into which wickedness is thrust represents the measure of iniquity which, being reached, constrains God to punish (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, where the dispossession of the Amorites is postponed till their iniquity is full). <span class="cmt_word">The weight of lead;</span> literally, as the LXX., <span class="accented">the stone of lead</span>; Vulgate<span class="accented">, massam plumbeam.</span> This is the cover of the ephah, that which is called the "talent of lead" in the preceding verse. This heavy cover the angel cast upon the mouth of the ephah, in order to confine the woman therein (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2</a>, which passage may explain why the cover is called "a stone"). Dr. Wright and some other commentators, referring the passage to theft and perjury alone, consider that the woman held in her hand the leaden weight with which she weighed her gains, and was sitting in the ephah which she used in her traffic; so that she represents dishonesty in the matter of weight and measure. She is punished by the means of the instruments she had used unrighteously; the weight is dashed upon her lying mouth, and the ephah, her throne, is made the vehicle that carries her out of the land. But it seems a mistake to confine the iniquity mentioned to the two special sins of theft and perjury; nor would the talent and the ephah be natural instruments of stealing and false swearing; and the point of the vision is not the punishment of wickedness, but its expulsion from the land. It is true that the pronominal suffix in the mouth thereof is feminine, and that the LXX. makes it refer to the woman, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. But it may equally refer to <span class="accented">ephah</span>, which is also feminine. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-11 In this vision the prophet sees an ephah, something in the shape of a corn measure. This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling the measure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be delivered into the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The woman sitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church and nation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon the sinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seems to mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure of their iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel. Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carried away to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should be hurried out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, as they had been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, and their sufferings shall continue far longer than in their late captivity. Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upon their own unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measure fills.</body></html>
