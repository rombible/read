The ephah was the largest of the dry measures in use among the Jews, and was equal to six or seven gallons. It was, of course, too small to contain a woman. The LXX. calls it simply "the measure;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">amphora</span>; and it must be considered as an imaginary vessel of huge size. It may have a tacit reference to dishonest dealings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This is their resemblance;</span> literally, <span class="accented">this is their eye</span>. The Authorized Version explains the meaning accurately. "Eye" is often used for that which is seen, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-55.htm">Leviticus 13:55</a>, where the Authorized Version has "colour;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>, where in reference to the manna we read, "The eve thereof was as the eye of bdellium" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4, 16</a>). So here the meaning is: This ephah and this whole vision represent the wicked in the land. Some take "the eye" to mean the object of sight, that to which they look. But the ephah was not sot forth for all the people to examine. The LXX. and Syriac, from some variation in the reading, have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "iniquity," and some critics have desired to adopt this in the text. But authority and necessity are equally wanting. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-11 In this vision the prophet sees an ephah, something in the shape of a corn measure. This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling the measure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be delivered into the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The woman sitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church and nation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon the sinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seems to mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure of their iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel. Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carried away to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should be hurried out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, as they had been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, and their sufferings shall continue far longer than in their late captivity. Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upon their own unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measure fills.</body></html>
