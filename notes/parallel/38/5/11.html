The feminine gender of the original would apply to either. She is carried away from Judaea to have a permanent dwelling in a land more suited to her. Pusey thinks that possibly a temple may be intended, "a great idol temple, in which the god of this world should be worshipped." <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Shinar;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the ideal land of unholiness, where the world power first arrayed itself against God in the attempt at Babel. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-2.htm">Genesis 11:2</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">Shinar</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">Sumer</span> in the Assyrian monuments, denotes Lower or Southern Babylon; <span class="accented">Accad</span>, Upper or Northern Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall be established.</span> The house shall be firmly fixed there. Others render, "when it is ready." <span class="cmt_word">And set there.</span> The gender shows that the woman is meant, not the house: "And she shall be set there in her own place." Thus from the spiritual Zion all wickedness shall be abolished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>) and sent to its own place prepared for the enemies of God and holiness. Doubtless, too, a warning is here conveyed to those Jews who still lingered in Babylon, that they were dwelling in a land accursed of God, and were liable to be involved in the fate which pursues ungodliness. Orelli and some others see in these two visions an analogy to the two goats on the Day of Atonement, of which one was sacrificed for the sins of the people, and the other bore away their iniquity to the demons' abode, the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:5-11 In this vision the prophet sees an ephah, something in the shape of a corn measure. This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling the measure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be delivered into the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The woman sitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church and nation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon the sinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seems to mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure of their iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel. Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carried away to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should be hurried out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, as they had been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, and their sufferings shall continue far longer than in their late captivity. Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upon their own unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measure fills.</body></html>
