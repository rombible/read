"First" means "first of all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1Timothy 2:1</a>), not "before I tell you." In studying prophecy this is the first thing to be borne in mind.<p><span class= "bld">Is of any private interpretation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">comes to be, </span>or <span class= "ital">becomes of private interpretation.</span> The word rendered "interpretation" occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; but the cognate verb occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-34.htm" title="But without a parable spoke he not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.">Mark 4:34</a>, where it is translated "expound." (See Note there.) There can be little doubt that "interpretation," or "solution," is the right rendering here, although others have been suggested. The main question however, is the meaning of the word rendered "private," which may also mean "its own." Hence three explanations are possible. The term may refer (1) to the recipients of the prophecies--that we may not expound prophecy according to our own fancy; or (2) to the utterers of the prophecies--that the prophets had not the power of expounding their own prophecies; or (3) to the prophecies themselves--that no prophecy comes to be of its own interpretation, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>no prophecy explains itself. The guide to the right explanation is <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>, which gives the reason <span class= "ital">why</span> "no prophecy of the scripture," &c. This consideration excludes (3); for <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a> yields no sense as showing why prophecy does not interpret itself. Either of the other two explanations may be right. (1) If prophecy came "by the will of man," then it might be interpreted according to man's fancy. But it did not so come; consequently the interpretation must be sought elsewhere--viz., at the same source from which the prophecy itself proceeded. (2) If the prophets spoke just as they pleased, they would be the best exponents of what they meant. But they spoke under divine influence, and therefore need not know the import of their own words. Prophecy must be explained by prophecy and by history, not by the individual prophet. The whole body of prophecy, "the prophetic word" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>), is our lamp in the wilderness, not the private <span class= "ital">dicta</span> of any one seer. In modern phraseology, interpretation must be comparative and scientific. This view is strengthened by comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10-12</a>, where it is stated that the prophets did not know how or when their own predictions would be fulfilled. Possibly this passage is meant to refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10-12</a>, and if so, we have a mark of genuineness; a forger would have made the reference more clear. If the coincidence is accidental, this also points in the same direction; in any case, the coincidence is worth noting.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.</span> By "knowing this first" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is meant that we must recognize this truth as of primary importance, or, before we commence the study of prophecy; the phrase occurs again in chapter 2 Peter 3:3. The literal translation of the following clause is, "that all prophecy of Scripture [there is no article] is not; all... not" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>) being a common Hebraism for none, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; but the verb is not <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "is," but <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "becomes, arises, comes into being." The word for "private" is <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "special," or commonly, "one's own" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1, 5</a>; chapter 2 Peter 2:16, 22; 3:3, 16, 17). The word rendered "interpretation" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, which is found nowhere else in the New Testament; the corresponding verb occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>, "He expounded all things;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-39.htm">Acts 19:39</a>, "It shall be determined or settled." These considerations, strengthened by the context, seem to guide us to the following explanation: No prophecy of Scripture arises from the prophet's own interpretation of the vision presented to his mind; for it was from God that the prophecy was brought, and men spoke as they were borne on by the Holy Spirit. This view of the passage is also supported by the remarkable parallel in the First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>). The prophets searched diligently into the meaning of the revelation vouchsafed to them; they did not always comprehend it in all its details; they could not interpret it to themselves; the written prophecy arose out of the interpretation of the revelation supplied by the same Spirit from whom the revelation itself proceeded. Therefore the prophetic books of Holy Scripture are sacred and precious, and we do well in giving heed to them; though the day-star of the Lord's own presence, shining in the illuminated heart, is holier still. Other views of this difficult passage are: Prophecy is not its own interpreter; the guidance of the Spirit is necessary. Or, prophecy is not a matter for the private interpretation of the readers; only the Holy Spirit can explain it. But the explanation adopted seems most accordant with the Greek words and with the general sense of the context (compare St. Paul's teaching in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). The gifts of the Spirit are divided as he will; to one man are given "divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues." Not every one, it seems, who had the first gift, had also the latter. Tongues and the interpretation of tongues were two distinct gifts. It may be so with prophecy and the interpretation of prophecy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:16-21 The gospel is no weak thing, but comes in power, Ro 1:16. The law sets before us our wretched state by sin, but there it leaves us. It discovers our disease, but does not make known the cure. It is the sight of Jesus crucified, in the gospel, that heals the soul. Try to dissuade the covetous worlding from his greediness, one ounce of gold weighs down all reasons. Offer to stay a furious man from anger by arguments, he has not patience to hear them. Try to detain the licentious, one smile is stronger with him than all reason. But come with the gospel, and urge them with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, shed to save their souls from hell, and to satisfy for their sins, and this is that powerful pleading which makes good men confess that their hearts burn within them, and bad men, even an Agrippa, to say they are almost persuaded to be Christians, Ac 26:28. God is well pleased with Christ, and with us in him. This is the Messiah who was promised, through whom all who believe in him shall be accepted and saved. The truth and reality of the gospel also are foretold by the prophets and penmenof the Old Testament, who spake and wrote under influence, and according to the direction of the Spirit of God. How firm and sure should our faith be, who have such a firm and sure word to rest upon! When the light of the Scripture is darted into the blind mind and dark understanding, by the Holy Spirit of God, it is like the day-break that advances, and diffuses itself through the whole soul, till it makes perfect day. As the Scripture is the revelation of the mind and will of God, every man ought to search it, to understand the sense and meaning. The Christian knows that book to be the word of God, in which he tastes a sweetness, and feels a power, and sees a glory, truly divine. And the prophecies already fulfilled in the person and salvation of Christ, and in the great concerns of the church and the world, form an unanswerable proof of the truth of Christianity. The Holy Ghost inspired holy men to speak and write. He so assisted and directed them in delivering what they had received from him, that they clearly expressed what they made known. So that the Scriptures are to be accounted the words of the Holy Ghost, and all the plainness and simplicity, all the power and all the propriety of the words and expressions, come from God. Mix faith with what you find in the Scriptures, and esteem and reverence the Bible as a book written by holy men, taught by the Holy Ghost.</body></html>
