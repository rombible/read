"</span>For" introduces the reason for "I will endeavour" above. The word for "follow," or "follow out," occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2Peter 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>, and nowhere else in the New Testament.<p><span class= "bld">Cunningly devised fables.</span>--We cannot be sure that any in particular are meant, whether heathen, Jewish, or Christian; the negative makes the statement quite general. Various things, however, have been suggested as possibly indicated--heathen mythology, Jewish theosophy, Gnostic systems (as yet quite in their infancy in Simon Magus, St. Peter's adversary), and Apocryphal Gospels. Probably some elements in the doctrine of the false teachers are alluded to; something analogous to the "feigned words" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2Peter 2:3</a>. There is reason for believing that the particular elements in their teaching thus incidentally condemned were of <span class= "ital">Jewish</span> origin. If this conjecture be correct, then <span class= "ital">St.</span> Peter is here dealing with errors similar to those condemned by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-4.htm" title="And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned to fables.">2Timothy 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-14.htm" title="Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.">Titus 1:14</a>--the only other passages in which the word "fables" occurs). And in this case much light is thrown on some of the marked peculiarities of this Epistle and that of St. Jude, viz., the fondness of both writers for the oldest, and sometimes the most obscure<span class= "bld">When we made known unto you.</span>--It is difficult to determine to what this refers. It is erroneous to suppose that the phrase necessarily implies personal communication by word of mouth. In the First Epistle the Apostle wrote to congregations not personally acquainted with him; and we have no reason for assuming that he had visited them since. "When we made known" may possibly refer to the First Epistle, against which supposition the plural "we" is not conclusive. Or a written Gospel--and, if so, the one with which St. Peter is commonly connected, viz., that of St. Mark--may be in the Apostle's mind. But the simplest explanation is that he refers to the Apostolic teaching generally.<p><span class= "bld">The power and coming.</span>--The <span class= "ital">power</span> conferred upon Christ after being glorified in His passion and resurrection, and his <span class= "ital">coming</span> again to judgment. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-27.htm" title="For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm" title="But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.">1Corinthians 15:23</a>; &c., &c., where the same Greek word is used.) In this power He will come again. His first coming at the Incarnation would neither be the usual meaning of the word nor would suit the context.<p><span class= "bld">But were eyewitnesses.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">but by having been made eye-witnesses. "</span>It was not by following fables that we made known to you His power and coming, but by having been admitted eye-witnesses." The word for "eye-witness" is sometimes a technical term for one who was admitted to the highest grade of initiation in the Eleusinian mysteries. This meaning would be very applicable here; but it may be doubted whether St. Peter would be familiar with this use of the word. It occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The kindred verb, "to be an eye-witness," occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-2.htm" title="While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.">1Peter 3:2</a>, and nowhere else--a coincidence worth noting. The words of another witness of the Transfiguration," And we beheld His glory," &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), should be compared with the passage before us.<p><span class= "bld">Of his majesty.</span>--At the Transfiguration, which was a foretaste and an earnest of the glory of His second coming. This is St. Peter's view of it; and that it is the correct one is perhaps shown by the Gospels themselves. All three accounts of the Transfiguration are preceded by the declaration, "Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom," or similar words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.">Matthew 16:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-1.htm" title="And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.">Mark 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-27.htm" title="But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.">Luke 9:27</a>). Apparently the Transfiguration was regarded by Christ Himself as in some sense the coming of the Son of man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables;</span> rather, <span class="accented">did not follow.</span> The participle (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is aorist. This compound verb is used only by St. Peter in the New Testament; we find it again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm">2 Peter 2:2</a> and 15. Bengel and others have thought that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, from or out of, implies wandering from the truth after false guides; but probably the word merely means "to follow closely," though in this case the guides were going astray. Perhaps the use of the plural number is accounted for by the fact that St. Peter was not the only witness of the glory of the Transfiguration; he associates in thought his two brother-apostles with himself. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fe6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, fables, with this exception, occurs in the New Testament only in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles. There is a remarkable parallel in the procemium of the 'Antiquities' of Josephus, sect. 4, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Peter may be referring to the "Jewish fables" mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>), or to the stories about the heathen gods such as those in Hesiod and Ovid, or possibly to some early inventions, such as those ascribed to Simon the Sorcerer, which were afterwards to be developed into the strange fictions of Gnosticism (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>). The word rendered "cunningly devised" occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>; but there a different part of the verb is used, and in a different sense. <span class="cmt_word">When we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> St. Peter can scarcely be referring to St. Paul or other missionaries, as the following words identify the preachers with the witnesses of the Transfiguration; he must be alluding either to his First Epistle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>), or to personal teaching of his which has not been recorded, or, just possibly, to the Gospel of St. Mark. St. Peter had seen the power of the Lord Jesus manifested in his miracles; he had heard the announcement of the risen Saviour, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;" he had, like the rest of the apostles, been "endued with power from on high." By the coming (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) he must mean the second advent, the invariable meaning of the word in Holy Scripture (see chapter 2 Peter 3:4, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">But were eye-witnesses of his majesty.</span> The word for "eye-witnesses" is not the common one (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, used by St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>), but a technical word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), which in classical Greek designates the highest class of those who had been initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. The choice of such a word may possibly imply that St. Peter regarded himself and his brother-apostles as having received the highest initiation into the mysteries of religion. The noun is found only here in the New Testament; but the corresponding verb occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a> and 1 Pet 3:2, and in no other of the New Testament writers. Here again we have an undesigned coincidence which points to identity of authorship. The word for "majesty" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs in St. Luke's description of the healing of the demoniac boy immediately after the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-43.htm">Luke 9:43</a>), and elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:16-21 The gospel is no weak thing, but comes in power, Ro 1:16. The law sets before us our wretched state by sin, but there it leaves us. It discovers our disease, but does not make known the cure. It is the sight of Jesus crucified, in the gospel, that heals the soul. Try to dissuade the covetous worlding from his greediness, one ounce of gold weighs down all reasons. Offer to stay a furious man from anger by arguments, he has not patience to hear them. Try to detain the licentious, one smile is stronger with him than all reason. But come with the gospel, and urge them with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, shed to save their souls from hell, and to satisfy for their sins, and this is that powerful pleading which makes good men confess that their hearts burn within them, and bad men, even an Agrippa, to say they are almost persuaded to be Christians, Ac 26:28. God is well pleased with Christ, and with us in him. This is the Messiah who was promised, through whom all who believe in him shall be accepted and saved. The truth and reality of the gospel also are foretold by the prophets and penmenof the Old Testament, who spake and wrote under influence, and according to the direction of the Spirit of God. How firm and sure should our faith be, who have such a firm and sure word to rest upon! When the light of the Scripture is darted into the blind mind and dark understanding, by the Holy Spirit of God, it is like the day-break that advances, and diffuses itself through the whole soul, till it makes perfect day. As the Scripture is the revelation of the mind and will of God, every man ought to search it, to understand the sense and meaning. The Christian knows that book to be the word of God, in which he tastes a sweetness, and feels a power, and sees a glory, truly divine. And the prophecies already fulfilled in the person and salvation of Christ, and in the great concerns of the church and the world, form an unanswerable proof of the truth of Christianity. The Holy Ghost inspired holy men to speak and write. He so assisted and directed them in delivering what they had received from him, that they clearly expressed what they made known. So that the Scriptures are to be accounted the words of the Holy Ghost, and all the plainness and simplicity, all the power and all the propriety of the words and expressions, come from God. Mix faith with what you find in the Scriptures, and esteem and reverence the Bible as a book written by holy men, taught by the Holy Ghost.</body></html>
