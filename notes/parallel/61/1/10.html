God calls us to salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3</a>), selects us from the heathen; it is for each one of us to respond to the call, and thus ratify His choice.<p><span class= "bld">If ye do these things</span>.--Showing that the making sure of our election is not a single act, but multiform, viz., the furnishing the graces commended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5-7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Never fall.</span>--The same word is translated "offend" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">James 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm" title="For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.">James 3:2</a>); and "stumble" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.">Romans 11:11</a>). It means to knock one's foot and stumble. The man who has acquired these graces has his path freed from many stumbling-blocks, and his vision cleared to see and avoid the rest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence.</span> The two first words, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "wherefore the rather," are by some understood as referring only to the last clause; as if St. Peter were saying, "Rather than follow those who lack the graces enumerated above, and forget that they were cleansed from their former sins, give diligence." <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is not unfrequently used in this antithetical sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-25.htm">Hebrews 11:25</a>. But it seems better to refer <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;</span> to the whole passage (verses 3-9), and to understand <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in its more usual intensive sense, "all the more," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:10</a>, etc. Because God has bestowed such gifts on men, because the use of those gifts leads on to the full knowledge of Christ, therefore all the more give diligence. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "give diligence," recalls the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "all diligence," of verse 5. The aorist seems, as it were, to sum up the continued diligence of daily life into one vivid description. This is the only place in which St. Peter uses the vocative "brethren;" he has "beloved" in the First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1, 8</a>. Both words imply affectionate exhortation. Two ancient manuscripts, the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic, insert here, "Through your good works (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">To make your calling and election sure.</span> Alford calls attention to the middle voice of the verb, "Not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which lay beyond their power, but <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, on their side, for their part. But the verb must not be explained away into a pure subjectivity, 'to make sure to yourselves;' it carries the reflexive force, but only in so far as the act is and must be done for and <span class="accented">quoad</span> a man's own self, the absolute and final determination resting with Another." The calling and election are the act of God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>). All the baptized, all who bear the name of Christ, are called into the Church, but few comparatively are chosen, elect (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>). We look, as it were, from far below up to the mysteries of God's sovereign government; we cannot read the list of blessed names written in the Lamb's book of life; we cannot lift ourselves to a point high enough to comprehend the secrets of God's dealing with mankind, and to reconcile the Divine foreknowledge and omnipotence with the free agency of man. But we feel the energy of that free agency within us; we know that Holy Scripture bids us to work out our salvation, and tells us of some who receive the grace of God in vain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>), or frustrate the grace of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>); and we feel that when the apostle tells us to make our calling and election sure, he means that we must try to realize that calling and election, to bring its solemn responsibilities and its blessed hopes to bear upon our daily life, to live as men who have been called into God's Church, who are elect unto eternal life, and so (if we may dare to say it) to ratify God's election by our poor acceptance. He calls us into covenant with himself; we answer, as the children of Israel said at Mount Sinai, "All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>). Our obedience makes the covenant sure to us; holiness of life is the proof of God's election, for it implies the indwelling presence of "that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance." <span class="cmt_word">For if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.</span> "If ye do these things;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "If ye make your calling and election sure." "The plural shows that the apostle considered this making sure a very many-sided act" (Dietlein, in Huther). Others refer the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "these things," to the graces just enumerated. <span class="accented">Ye shall never fall</span>; literally, <span class="accented">ye shall never stumble</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "to strike one's foot against some obstacle," and so to stumble. St. James says, "In many things we offend (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). St. Peter here means to stumble so as to fall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>); while Christians "do these things," while they make their calling and election sure by holiness of life, they cannot stumble; it is in unguarded moments that they fall into temptation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does the strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God. Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.</body></html>
