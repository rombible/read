"Always" (or better, <span class= "ital">at all times</span>) belongs to "may be able," not to "have in remembrance;" and perhaps "moreover" is not quite right. Better, <span class= "ital">But I will endeavour that ye</span> <span class= "ital">may at all times also</span> (as well as now) <span class= "ital">have it in your power after my decease to remember these things.</span> To what does this declaration point? The simplest answer is, to his writing this letter, which they might keep and read whenever they liked. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm" title="Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;">2Peter 1:13</a>.) Other suggestions are--to his having copies of this letter distributed; or, writing other letters; or, instructing, St. Mark to write his Gospel; or, commissioning "faithful men" to teach these things. There seems to be nothing either for or against these conjectures. It is a coincidence worth noting that, with the Transfiguration in his mind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16-18</a>), he uses, in close succession, two words connected in St. Luke's account of the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-31.htm" title="Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.">Luke 9:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.">Luke 9:33</a>)--"decease" and "tabernacle."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but I will also give diligence that ye may be able at every time after my decease to call these things to remembrance.</span> Of the two particles used here the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> connects this verso with verse 13; the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> implies a further resolve. St. Peter will not only stir up the minds of his readers during his life, but he will give diligence to enable them to call to remembrance, after his death, the truths which he had preached. These words may refer simply to the present Epistle; but it seems more natural to understand them of an intention to commit to writing the facts of the gospel history; if this be so, we have here a confirmation of the ancient tradition that the Second Gospel was written by St. Mark at the dictation of St. Peter. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is that used in verse 10, and should be translated in the same way; they must give diligence to make their calling and election sure. St. Peter, for his part, will give diligence to furnish them with a lasting record of the truths of Christianity. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, at every time, whenever there may be need, occurs only here in the New Testament. (For <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "to be able," compare the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>.) It is remarkable that we have here, in two consecutive verses, two words which remind us of the history of the Transfiguration, "tabernacle," and "decease" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>). Then Peter proposed to make three tabernacles; then he heard Moses and Elijah speaking of the Lord's decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. The simple unconscious occurrence of these coincidences is a strong proof of the genuineness of our Epistle; it is inconceivable that an imitator of the second century should have shown this delicate skill in adapting his production to the circumstances of the supposed writer. The last words of the verse may mean (and in classical Greek would mean) "to make mention of these things;" but the usual rendering seems more suitable here. St. Peter was anxious rather that his readers should have the truths of the gospel living in their memories, than that they should talk about them; that would follow as a matter of course: "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Some Roman Catholic commentators think that this passage contains a promise that the apostle would still, after his death, continue to remember the needs of the Church on earth, and to help them by his intercessions; but this interpretation involves a complete dislocation of clauses, and cannot possibly be the true meaning of the words. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-15 We must be established in the belief of the truth, that we may not be shaken by every wind of doctrine; and especially in the truth necessary for us to know in our day, what belongs to our peace, and what is opposed in our time. The body is but a tabernacle, or tent, of the soul. It is a mean and movable dwelling. The nearness of death makes the apostle diligent in the business of life. Nothing can so give composure in the prospect, or in the hour, of death, as to know that we have faithfully and simply followed the Lord Jesus, and sought his glory. Those who fear the Lord, talk of his loving-kindness. This is the way to spread the knowledge of the Lord; and by the written word, they are enabled to do this.</body></html>
