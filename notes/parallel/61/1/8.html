The original of "be in you" is a strong expression, implying permanent and not mere momentary existence.<p><span class= "bld">And abound.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">and multiply</span> or <span class= "ital">increase.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>, and Note there; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2Thessalonians 1:3</a>, where the same inadequate translation occurs in the Authorised version.)<p><span class= "bld">Neither be barren nor unfruitful.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">not idle nor yet unfruitful.</span> Cranmer, Tyndale, and Geneva all have "ydle." The Greek word literally means "without work"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>doing nothing, as" unfruitful" means producing nothing. "That ye shall be" is not in the Greek, and is not needed. The two adjectives "idle" and "unfruitful" exactly correspond to the two verbs "be in you" and "increase." If these things be in you, you will be morally active; if they increase, you will be morally productive.<p><span class= "bld">In the knowledge.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">unto the knowledge</span>; the fuller, more advanced knowledge of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-2.htm" title="Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,">2Peter 1:2-3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm" title="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.">2Peter 2:20</a>. This is the goal towards which all these virtues tend, the fruit which they tend to produce--the perfect knowledge of Christ. Those who are the most like Christ in their lives have the fullest knowledge of Him in this world, a knowledge to be perfected in the next world, when, purified from sin, "we shall see Him as He is." This clause, without the negatives, accurately describes the condition of the false teachers whom the Apostle has in view. They were both "idle and unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." They neither did nor produced anything that in any degree advanced such knowledge either in themselves or others. The list of virtues just commended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5-7</a>) constitutes a solemn indictment against them. Practical infidelity leading to vicious conduct; a hollow and pretentious philosophy leading to libertinism; an impatience of control leading to utter godlessness; a selfish indifference to the claims of those nearest to them ending in absolute heartlessness towards all men--such is the charge brought against them, by implication here, directly in 2 Peter 2.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if these things be in you, and abound;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for these things belonging to you and abounding make</span>, etc. The word used here (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) implies actual possession; these graces must be made our own; they must be wrought into our characters: then they will increase and multiply, for the grace of God cannot lie still, it must ever he advancing from glory to glory. <span class="cmt_word">They make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> literally, <span class="accented">they make you not idle nor yet unfruitful towards the full knowledge.</span> The Greek word for "knowledge" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (on which see verse 2, and note there). Here we know only in part, we see through a glass darkly; but that imperfect knowledge should be ever growing, increasing in fullness and distinctness (see chapter 2 Peter 3:18). The various graces of the Christian character, realized in the heart, will lead us on towards that fuller knowledge of Christ; if they are really ours, they will not allow us to be idle, they must bring forth the fruit of good works; and the life of righteousness by faith draws the Christian onwards in the knowledge of Christ: we learn to knew him by following him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does the strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God. Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.</body></html>
