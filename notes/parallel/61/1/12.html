(For this use of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> with the infinitive almost as a periphrasis for the future, compare, in the Greek, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6</a>.) The apostle will take every opportunity of reminding his readers of the truths and duties which he has been describing, and that because faith in those truths and the practice of those duties is the only way to Christ's eternal kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Though ye know them, and be established in the present truth;</span> better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and are established in the truth which is with you.</span> These words seem to imply that St. Peter knew something, through Silvanus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>), of those to whom he was writing; they were not ignorant of the gospel; now they had read his First Epistle, and earlier they had heard the preaching of St. Paul or his companions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>). (For the word rendered "established" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16, 17</a>.) St. Peter seems to have kept ever in his thoughts the solemn charge of the Saviour, "When thou art converted, strengthen (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) thy brethren" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>). For "the truth which is with you" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-15 We must be established in the belief of the truth, that we may not be shaken by every wind of doctrine; and especially in the truth necessary for us to know in our day, what belongs to our peace, and what is opposed in our time. The body is but a tabernacle, or tent, of the soul. It is a mean and movable dwelling. The nearness of death makes the apostle diligent in the business of life. Nothing can so give composure in the prospect, or in the hour, of death, as to know that we have faithfully and simply followed the Lord Jesus, and sought his glory. Those who fear the Lord, talk of his loving-kindness. This is the way to spread the knowledge of the Lord; and by the written word, they are enabled to do this.</body></html>
