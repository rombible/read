Wiclif, "He gaf;" Rheims, "He hath given."<p><span class= "bld">Promises.</span>--The Greek word occurs here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a> only. Its termination indicates the things promised rather than the act of promising. They are "exceeding great," or rather "the greatest," because they contain an earnest of the completion and perfection of the Christian life; they are very "precious," because this earnest is in itself something real, and not mere empty words. Not the promises of the Old Testament are meant, that Christ should come; but those of the New Testament, that Christ should come again. The certainty of Christ's return to reward the righteous and punish the wicked is one of the main subjects of the Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">That by these.</span>--"These" is variously referred (1) to "all things that pertain unto life and godliness," (2) to "glory and virtue," (3) to "promises." The last is most likely, the second least likely to be right. The hope expressed in this verse, and again 3:13, is distinctly parallel to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Ye might be partakers.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">become partakers.</span> Rheims, "be made." This idea of close relationship to God and escape from corruption is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm" title="Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and stays for ever.">1Peter 1:23</a>. The change from the first person plural to the second is easy enough both in Greek and English: by it what is true of all Christians is applied specially to those whom the writer is addressing. We have a similar change in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Through lust.</span>--Rather (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm" title="Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;">2Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2Peter 2:3</a>) <span class= "ital">in lust.</span> It is in lust that the corruption has its root. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>.) The word "escaped" indicates that "<span class= "ital">bondage</span> of corruption" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>) from which even the Christian is not wholly free, so long as he is in the body; and in which others are hopelessly held. A comparison of this last clause with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a> will confirm us in the view that "by these" refers to the "promises." We see there what the things promised are. Instead of merely "having escaped" evil, "we, <span class= "ital">according to His promise, </span>look for" better things; for, from "the corruption that is in the world in lust" we turn to "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." There should be no full-stop at the end of this verse; the sentence continues unbroken from the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3</a> to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-7.htm" title="And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.">2Peter 1:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">whereby he hath granted unto us h is precious and exceeding great promises.</span> Does the word "whereby" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "through which things") refer to the immediately preceding words, "glory and virtue"? or is its antecedent to be found in the more distant "all things which pertain unto life and godliness"? Both views are possible. God first granted unto us all things necessary for life and godliness; through those first gifts, duly used, he has granted unto us others more precious still. But it <span class="accented">seems</span> better to connect the relative with the nearer antecedent. It is through God's glory and virtue, through his glorious attributes and the energetic working of those attributes, that he has granted the promises. The verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) should be translated "hath granted," as in the preceding verse. The word for "promise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs <span class="accented">elsewhere</span> only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>; it means the thing promised, not the act of promising. The order of the words, "exceeding great and precious," is differently given in the manuscripts; on the whole, that adopted by the Revised Version seems the best supported. The article with the first word (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) has a possessive force, and is well rendered, "his precious promises." They are precious, because they will be certainly fulfilled in all their depth of blessed meaning, and because they are in part fulfilled at once (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>, "In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance"). The word "precious" reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 19</a>; the resemblance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a> is apparent only, in the Authorized Version, not in the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">That by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that through these</span> (promises, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, through their fulfillment) <span class="accented">ye may beeome partakers.</span> It is true that the verb is aorist (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), but it does not follow that, might be" is the right translation, or that the writer regarded the participation as having already taken place (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-36.htm">John 12:36</a>, "Believe in the light, that ye may be (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) the children of light"). As Alford says, the aorist seems to imply "that the aim was not the procedure, but the completion, of that indicated; not the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the carrying on the process, but the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, its accomplishment." The end of God's gift is the complete accomplishment of his gracious purpose, but it is only by continual growth that the Christian attains at length to that accomplishment. St. Peter's words seem very bold; but they do not go beyond many other statements of Holy Scripture. At the beginning God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." St. Paul tells us that believers are now "changed into the same image from glory to glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-49.htm">1 Corinthians 15:49</a>, etc.). Christians, born of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>), are made "partakers of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>), "partakers of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>). Christ prayed for us that we might be "made perfect in one" with himself who is one with God the Father, through the indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost the Comforter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16, 17, 23</a>). The second person is used to imply that the promises made to all Christians (unto <span class="accented">us</span>) belong to those whom St. Peter now addresses. <span class="cmt_word">Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust;</span> literally, <span class="accented">having escaped from the corruption that is in the world in lust.</span> These words express the negative side of the Christian life, the former clause describing its active and positive side. God's precious promises realized in the soul enable the Christian to become partakers of the Divine nature, and to escape from corruption; the two aspects of the Christian life must go on simultaneously; each implies and requires the other. Bengel says, "Haec fuga non tam ut officium nostrum, quam ut beneficium divinum, communionem cum Deo comitans, hoc loco ponitur." The verb used here (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs in the New Testament only in this Epistle. It reminds us of St. Paul's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>, "The creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption." The corruption or destruction (for the Word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> has both those meanings) from which we must escape has its seat and power in lust; working secretly in the lusts of men's wicked hearts, it manifests its evil presence in the world (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does the strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God. Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.</body></html>
