God has given us all we need for salvation; let us profit by it, and show ourselves worthy of it.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">According as.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">seeing that</span> This must not be made to depend on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-2.htm" title="Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,">2Peter 1:2</a>. In the canonical Epistles the address does not go beyond the blessing. Galatians is the only exception; there a relative clause is added to the blessing; but this is solemnly brought to a close with a doxology, so that the exception is one that almost proves the rule. In Hebrews, James, 1 and 3 John, there is no opening blessing; the remark holds good of all the rest. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3-4</a> are a brief introduction to the direct exhortations contained <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5-11</a>. The eagerness with which the writer goes direct to his subject is characteristic of St. Peter's temper.<p><span class= "bld">His divine power.</span>--The pronoun refers to "Jesus our Lord." The adjective occurs in the New Testament in these two verses (3 and 4) only; elsewhere we have the genitive case, "of God," "of the Lord," "of the Father," and the like.<p><span class= "bld">All things that pertain unto</span>.--All that are necessary for the attainment of. He does not give life and godliness in maturity, but supplies us with the means of winning them for ourselves. "All" is emphatic; nothing that is requisite is grudged us, and nothing is our own, it is all the gift of God.<p><span class= "bld">Godliness.</span>--The Greek word occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm" title="And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?">Acts 3:12</a>, in a speech of St. Peter, and four times in this Epistle; elsewhere only in those to Timothy and Titus. It belongs to the phraseology of the later books of the New Testament. "Godliness" is the realisation of God's abiding presence, the fruits of which are reverence and trust: "Thou God seest me;" "I have set God always before me, therefore I cannot fall." It is introduced here, perhaps, in opposition to the godlessness and irreverence of the false teachers. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm" title="Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.">2Timothy 3:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Through the knowledge.</span>--Through learning to know God as One who has called us to salvation.

"To" cannot be correct, whichever of the various readings is the right one, Tyndale, Cranmer, and Rheims have "by;" the error comes from Geneva, which has "unto." "Glory" points to the majesty of God, "virtue" to His activity. "Virtue" as applied to God is unusual, but occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a> (see Note there), a coincidence to be noted. The word is rendered there "praises," but "virtues" is given in the margin. The whole verse is strikingly parallel to this one, though very differently expressed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According as his Divine power;</span> better, <span class="accented">seeing that</span>, as in the Revised Version. The construction is the genitive absolute with <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>. The words are to be closely connected with verse 2: "We need not fear, for God has given us all things that are necessary for our salvation; grace and peace will be multiplied unto us, if only we seek the knowledge of God." This is better than, with Huther and others, to make a full stop after verse 2, and to connect verses 3 and 4 closely with verse 5. The word for "Divine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is unusual in the Greek Testament; it occurs only in two other places - verse 4 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>. Hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">hath granted.</span> St. Peter does not here use the ordinary verb for "to give," but one (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) which in the New Testament occurs only in this Epistle and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-45.htm">Mark 15:45</a>. "God hath given us all things for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) life," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, all things necessary for life. By "life" St. Peter means the spiritual life of the soul; that life which consists in union with Christ, which is the life of Christ living in us. "Godliness" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is a word of the later apostolic age; besides this Epistle (in which it occurs four times) and a speech of St. Peter's in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>, it is found only in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles; it means reverence, true piety towards God. Through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue; literally, <span class="accented">through the full knowledge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">of him that called us</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God. and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent"). The best-supported reading seems to be that followed by the Revised Version, "By his own glory and virtue (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>)<span class="accented">."</span> Bengel says, "Ad gloriam referuntur attributa Dei naturalia, ad virtutem ea quae dicuntur moralia; intime unum sunt utraque." All his glorious attributes make up his glory; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, virtue, is the energy, the activity of those attributes. The other reading, also well supported (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "through glory and virtue"), would mean nearly the same (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). God calls us through his attributes; his glorious perfections invite us, the revelation of those perfections calls us to his service. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, with one exception (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>), occurs in the New Testament only in St. Peter's Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a> and 5). This <span class="accented">is</span>, so far, an argument in favour of identity of authorship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does the strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God. Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.</body></html>
