"Simon" has probably been substituted as being more usual. The Geneva Bible, which our translators unfortunately sometimes follow when it is <span class= "ital">misleading, </span>has "Simeon." "Symeon," of St. Peter, occurs elsewhere only <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-14.htm" title="Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.">Acts 15:14</a>, in a speech of the strongly Jewish St. James. As being the more Jewish form of the name, it points to a Jewish Christian as the author; and as being unusual, it shows that the writer, if not the Apostle, is no slavish imitator. As coming from St. Peter, the Apostle of the circumcision, it is natural enough. The differences between this opening and that of 1 Peter are instructive. There, as approaching communities which might seem to belong to St. Paul, he carefully suppresses everything personal; he calls himself merely "Peter," the name which Christ Himself had given him along with his high commission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>), and "Apostle," the title which stated his commission. Here, as coming a second time to those who now know him better (both through his former Epistle and through Silvanus), he adds personal designations. There, as if not venturing to depart greatly from his own peculiar field, he addresses himself mainly to the Jewish converts. Here, with more boldness, the natural result of increased familiarity, he addresses Gentile converts chiefly. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A servant and an apostle.</span>--De Wette suspects a combination of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm" title="Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:">Jude 1:1</a>. The coincidence is too slight to argue upon. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a> and Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm" title="Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:">Jude 1:1</a>.) The amount of similarity between the opening verses of Jude and those of this Epistle is too small for any conclusions as to the dependence of one on the other. Although the word for "servant" strictly means <span class= "ital">slave, </span>the English version is quite correct. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To them that have obtained</span>.--The Greek word implies that they have not won it or earned it for themselves, but that it has been allotted to them. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm" title="For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.">Acts 1:17</a>, where the same word (rare in the New Testament) occurs <span class= "ital">in a speech of St. Peter.</span> (See Note on "godliness," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3</a>.) Another coincidence to be noticed is the way in which St. Peter speaks of the Gentile Christians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm" title="For as much then as God gave them the like gift as he did to us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?">Acts 11:17</a>) when charged with having visited "men uncircumcised," and again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/15-8.htm" title="And God, which knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did to us;">Acts 15:8-11</a>) at the Council of Jerusalem; both remarkable parallels to this.<p><span class= "bld">Like precious faith with us.</span>--Not that all had an equal amount of faith, which would scarcely be possible; nor that their faith gave all an equal right to salvation, which the Greek could scarcely mean; but that all believed the same precious mysteries. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 1:7</a>.) It is delicately implied that "we as well as you have had it allotted to us; it is no credit to us; we are not superior to you." "Us" may mean either the Apostles, or (more probably) the first Christians, as distinct from those converted later, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, Jewish as distinct from Gentile Christians. This shows that Gentile converts are chiefly addressed in this Epistle, as Jewish in the First Epistle. Gentiles would be more likely to be doubters respecting Christ's return to judgment, than Jews well acquainted with Hebrew prophecies on the subject. Gentiles also would be more likely than Jews to fall into the excesses denounced in the second chapter, which bear a strong resemblance to the catalogue of heathen vices given by St. Paul in Romans 1 The idea that Christians are the antitype of the chosen people is prominent in St. Peter's writings. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10</a>.) Note that no particular churches are mentioned. The Second Epistle is more "general" or "catholic" in its address than the First. Here again we have a mark of independence. A writer personating St. Peter, and referring to the former Letter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm" title="This second letter, beloved, I now write to you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:">2Peter 3:1</a>), would probably have taken care to make the address of the second letter tally exactly with that of the first.<p><span class= "bld">Through the</span> <span class= "bld">righteousness.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in the righteousness.</span> So Wiclif, Tyndale, and Rheims version. "Righteousness" is variously explained. Perhaps the best interpretation is "fairness, justice."

Rigid grammar would incline us to make "God" and "Saviour" both apply to Christ. But rigid grammar alone is not always the safest guide in interpreting Scripture. The very next verse, independently of other considerations, seems to determine that both the Father and the Son are here mentioned. The mode of expression which causes doubt on the subject, perhaps indicates the writer's perfect belief in the oneness of the Father with the Son. The addition of "Saviour" to the name of Jesus Christ is very frequent in this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm" title="For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm" title="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.">2Peter 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.">2Peter 3:18</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-2.htm" title="That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:">2Peter 3:2</a>). It shows how completely "Jesus" had become a proper name, the exact signification of which was becoming obscured. "Saviour" does not occur in 1 Pet., but the cognate "salvation" does (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-9.htm" title="But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.">2Peter 1:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2Peter 2:2</a>). Both words point onwards to safety from perdition at the last. (Comp. St. Peter's speech, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Simon Peter.</span> "Symeon" seems to be the best-supported spelling in this place. The same form of the name is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>; it also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>, where St. James refers to St. Peter's speech on the great question of the circumcision of Gentile Christians. It is the form always used in the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament. The old man's thoughts go back to his early years; he describes himself by the familiar name of his youth; he uses that Greek form of it which was most distinctively Jewish. But he joins with the old name, which spoke of Judaism, the new name which the Lord Jesus had given him - the name which describes him as a stone or rock, which indicates also his close connection with that Rock on which the Church is built, which is Christ. His names combine Hebrew and Greek, Jewish and Christian, associations. He is writing probably, as in his First Epistle, to Churches of mingled Jewish and Gentile elements. The first word of the Epistle supplies an argument for the genuineness of the Epistle. It is scarcely possible that an imitator, who was acquainted with the First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>), and shows, as some say, so much anxiety to identify himself with the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12-18</a>), would have announced himself by a name different from that used in the First Epistle, and would have adopted a form of the Hebrew name varying from that which occurs so frequently in the Gospels. <span class="cmt_word">A servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.</span> St. Peter, like St. Paul, describes himself as a servant, literally, "a slave," a bondman of Jesus Christ. We are not our own; we are bought with a price; we have work to do for our Master. St. Peter's work was that of a missionary, an apostle sent into the world to win souls for Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them that have obtained like precious faith with us.</span> The word rendered "obtained" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) means properly "to obtain by lot," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>. It is noticeable that one of the few places in which it occurs in the New Testament is in a speech of St. Peter's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm">Acts 1:17</a>); its use here implies that faith is a gift of God. The word for "like precious" equally precious) is found only here in the New Testament; it calls to our memory the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>, and indicates a correspondence with the First Epistle. St. Peter addresses this Epistle simply to those who have obtained an equally precious faith "with us." By the last words he may mean himself only, or the apostles generally, or, possibly, all Jewish Christians. He is writing apparently to the same Churches to which his First Epistle was addressed (verse 16 and chapter 1 Peter 3:1); he says that their faith is equally precious with that of the apostles, or perhaps that the Gentiles have received the like precious gift with the chosen people. By "faith" he may mean the truths believed, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>; or, more probably, faith in the subjective sense, the grace of faith, which receives those truths as a message from God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span> Some commentators, as Luther, Estius, etc., understand by "righteousness" in this place, the righteousness which God gives, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>, etc. But this seems unsuitable here; for faith is not given in righteousness, but rather righteousness in faith. Others take righteousness as the object of the faith - "to them that have Obtained faith in the righteousness;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, who are enabled to believe in God's righteousness and to trust in it. This seems a forced interpretation. It is better to take the preposition as meaning "in the working of God's righteousness," in the sphere of its operation, and to understand "righteousness" as the attribute of God, his just and holy dealing with men. There is no respect of persons with God; in his righteousness he bestows the like precious faith on all who come to him, without distinction of race or country. According to the strict grammatical construction of the passage, "God" and "Saviour" are both predicates of "Jesus Christ," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>. The First and Second Persons of the blessed Trinity are distinguished in the following verse, and this has led several commentators to think that the same distinction should be made here. It is true that the absence of a second article does not make it absolutely certain that the two words "God" and "Saviour" must be taken as united under the one common article, and so regarded as two predicates of "Jesus Christ;" but it furnishes at least a very strong presumption in favour of this view, especially as there is not here, as there is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, any word like <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to give definiteness to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see Bishop Ellicott's note on Titus 2:13, and, on the other side, Alford's notes on both passages). The Lord Jesus is called "our Saviour" five times in this Epistle. The word does not occur in the First Epistle; but in St. Peter's speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>) the apostle declared to the Sanhedrin that God had exalted Jesus "to be a Prince and a Saviour." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does the strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God. Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.</body></html>
