And though "charity begins at home" with "them who are of the household of faith," it must not end there, but reach out to all men, whether Christians or not. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:">1Thessalonians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a>.) The translation "brotherly kindness" is a little to be regretted; it obscures the exact meaning of the Word, and also the fact that the very same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>. "Love of the brethren" means love of Christians as such, as members of the same great family, as God's adopted children. "Charity" means love of men as such, as creatures made in the likeness of God, as souls for which Christ died. The word for "charity" is emphatically Christian love; not mere natural benevolence.<p>Each in this noble chain of virtues prepares the way for the next, and is supplemented and perfected by it. It begins with faith, and it ends (like St. Paul's list of virtues, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12-14</a>) with charity. But we must not insist too strongly upon the order in the series, as being either logically or chronologically necessary. It is a natural order that is here given, but not the only one. These three verses are the First Epistle condensed. Each one of the virtues mentioned here is represented quite distinctly in 1 Peter: virtue, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1Peter 1:13</a>; knowledge, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>; self-control, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>; patience, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1Peter 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a>; godliness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1Peter 1:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm" title="But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.">1Peter 3:4</a>; love of the brethren, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm" title="Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:">1Peter 3:8</a>; charity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm" title="And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.">1Peter 4:8</a>. The list of virtues given in the <span class= "ital">Epistle of Barnabas</span> 2 runs thus:--<span class= "ital">Faith, </span>fear, <span class= "ital">patience, </span>long - suffering, <span class= "ital">temperance, </span>wisdom, prudence, science, <span class= "ital">knowledge.</span> The very slight amount of similarity affords no ground for supposing that the writer was acquainted with 2 Peter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</span> The word for "brotherly kindness" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is another link between the two Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>). "In your godliness," St. Peter says, "ye must develop brotherly kindness, the unfeigned love of the brethren;" for "every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>). And as God is loving unto every man, and "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good," so Christians, who are taught to be followers (imitators) of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1</a>), must learn in the exercise of love toward the brethren that larger love which embraces all men in an ever-widening circle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:12</a>). Thus love, the greatest of all Christian graces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>), is the climax in St. Peter's list. Out of faith, the root, spring the seven fair fruits of holiness, of which holy love is the fairest and the sweetest (comp. Ignatius, 'Ad Ephes.,' 14. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>). No grace can remain alone; each grace, as it is gradually formed in the soul, tends to develop and strengthen others; all graces meet in that highest grace of charity, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead before God. Bengel says well, "Praeseus quisque gradus subsequentem parit et facilem reddit, subsequens priorem temperat ac perficit." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does the strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God. Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.</body></html>
