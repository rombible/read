The "for" introduces the second reason for the exhortation to furnish forth all these graces--viz., the evil of not having them. The Greek implies absence of possession in any degree, not merely absence of permanent possession. (See first Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Is blind.</span>--We might have expected "will be idle and unfruitful, &c.," but the writer is not content with merely emphasizing what has just been said, after the manner of St. John (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1John 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1John 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1John 2:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1John 4:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.">1John 4:6</a>); he puts the case in a new way, with a new metaphor equally, applicable to the subject of knowledge. Note that he does not say "<span class= "ital">will</span> be blind," but"<span class= "ital"> is</span> blind." The very fact of his possessing none of these graces shows that he has no eye for them.<p><span class= "bld">Cannot see afar off.</span>--The Greek word means literally <span class= "ital">closing the eyes</span>; and the point seems to be, not wilful shutting of the eyes (those who <span class= "ital">won't</span> see), but involuntary and partial closing, as in the case of <span class= "ital">short-sighted</span> people; in a spiritual sense, those who have only a very hazy apprehension of the objects of belief and of the bearing which their beliefs should have on their conduct. There is, therefore, no anti-climax, a weak expression following a strong one, but a simple explanation, a more definite term following a general one; it explains what kind of blindness is meant. The special kind of short-sightedness here indicated is that of one who just sees that he is a member of a Christian community, but perceives neither the kind of life that one who has been purged from heathen enormities is bound to lead, nor the kind of life which alone can win an entrance into Christ's kingdom. The shortsightedness of not being able to see beyond this present world is probably not expressed here.<p><span class= "bld">And hath forgotten.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">having received</span> or <span class= "ital">incurred forgetfulness</span>--a unique expression in the New Testament. The phrase does not necessarily imply that the forgetfulness is voluntary; it is the inevitable result of wilful neglect--the neglect to cultivate Christian virtues. The forgetfulness is not the cause of the shortsightedness, but a phase of it.<p><span class= "bld">His old sins.</span>--Those committed before he was "purged" in baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for he to whom these things are not present is blind, short-sighted.</span> We cannot attain to the knowledge of Christ without these graces, for he who has them not is blind, or, at the best, short-sighted, like one who blinks with his eyes when he tries to see distant objects, and cannot bear the full light of day. Such a man can only see the things which lie close around him - earth and earthly things; he cannot lift up his eyes by faith and behold "the land that is very far off;" he cannot "see the King in his beauty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). The word for "short-sighted" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament. And hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins; literally, <span class="accented">having incurred forgetfulness of the cleansing from his old sins.</span> St. Peter is apparently thinking of the one baptism for the remission of sin. Ananias had said to Saul, "Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>); St. Peter himself had said, in his first great sermon, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." Those who do not realize in the religious life that death unto sin of which holy baptism is the sign and the beginning, incur forgetfulness of the cleansing from sin which they then received; they do not use the grace once given for the attainment of those higher graces of which St. Peter has been speaking. The one talent once entrusted to them must be taken from them; they are idle and unfruitful, and cannot reach unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does the strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God. Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.</body></html>
