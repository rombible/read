The natural ending would be, "He had us as His attendants to hear it," or something of that kind.<p><span class= "bld">Honour and glory.</span>--Both refer to the voice from heaven. To make "honour" refer to the voice, and "glory" to the light shining from Christ's body, about which nothing has been said, is forced and unnatural.<p><span class= "bld">When there came such a voice to him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in that a voice was borne to Him speaking thus.</span> The expression "a voice was borne to Him" is peculiar, and occurs nowhere else. The Greek for "the grace that is to be brought to you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1Peter 1:13</a>) is parallel to it, and is another small coincidence worth noting. Note also that the writer has not slavishly followed any of the three accounts of the Transfiguration, which a forger might be expected to do. A genuine witness, knowing that he is on firm ground can afford to take his own line; a "claimant" must carefully learn and follow the lines of others.<p><span class= "bld">From the excellent glory.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">by the excellent glory</span>--another unique expression. The preposition "by" almost compels us to reject the interpretation that either the bright cloud or heaven itself is meant. It is rather a periphrasis for God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm" title="There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heaven in your help, and in his excellency on the sky.">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>. God is called by the LXX., "the Excellent of the sky."<p><span class= "bld">This is my beloved Son, . . .</span>--The Greek is almost the same as in St. Matthew's account (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm" title="While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.">Matthew 17:5</a>); but "hear him" is omitted, and for "in Whom" we here have, "unto Whom" which can scarcely be brought into the English sentence. The meaning is "<span class= "ital">unto Whom</span> my good pleasure came and on Whom it abides." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a>, and Clem., <span class= "ital">Hom.</span> III. liii.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he received from God the Father honour and glory.</span> The construction here is interrupted; the literal translation is, "Having received," etc., and there is no verb to complete the sense. Winer supposes that the apostle had intended to continue with some such words as, "He had us for witnesses," or, "He was declared to be the beloved Son of God," and that the construction was interrupted by the direct quotation of the words spoken by the voice from heaven ('Grammar,' 3:45, b). (For a similar anacoluthon, see in the Greek <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-6.htm">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>.) "Honour" seems to refer to the testimony of the voice from heaven; "glory," to the splendour of the Lord's transfigured Person. <span class="cmt_word">When there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">when such a voice was borne to him.</span> The same verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a> of "the <span class="accented">rushing</span> mighty wind" which announced the coming of the Holy Ghost; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a> of "the grace which is being brought." It is repeated in the next verse. It seems intended to assert emphatically the real objective character of the voice. It was not a vision, a dream; the voice was borne from heaven; the apostles heard it with their ears. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> must be rendered "by," not "from." The "excellent" (rather, "majestic," or "magnificent") glory was the Shechinah, the visible manifestation of the presence of God, which had appeared in ancient times on Mount Sinai, and in the tabernacle and temple above the mercy-seat. God was there; it was he who spoke. For the word rendered "excellent" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) compare the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "the Majestic One of the firmament;" where our Authorized Version gives a more exact translation of the Hebrew, "in his excellency on the sky" (see also the 'Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians,' chapter 9, where the occurrence of the same remarkable words, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, suggests that Clement must have been acquainted with this Epistle). This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Our translation makes these words correspond exactly with the report given by St. Matthew in his account of the Transfiguration, except that "hear ye him" is added there. In the Greek there are some slight variations. According to one ancient manuscript (the Vatican), the order of the words is different, and there is a second pen, "This is my Son, my Beloved." All uncial manuscripts have here, instead of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span> of St. Matthew's Gospel, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. The difference cannot be represented in our translation. The construction is pregnant, and the meaning is that from all eternity the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the good pleasure, of God the Father was directed towards the Divine Son, and still abideth on him. The same truth seems to be implied in the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"). An imitator of the second century would certainly have made this quotation to correspond exactly with the words as given in one of the synoptic Gospels. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:16-21 The gospel is no weak thing, but comes in power, Ro 1:16. The law sets before us our wretched state by sin, but there it leaves us. It discovers our disease, but does not make known the cure. It is the sight of Jesus crucified, in the gospel, that heals the soul. Try to dissuade the covetous worlding from his greediness, one ounce of gold weighs down all reasons. Offer to stay a furious man from anger by arguments, he has not patience to hear them. Try to detain the licentious, one smile is stronger with him than all reason. But come with the gospel, and urge them with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, shed to save their souls from hell, and to satisfy for their sins, and this is that powerful pleading which makes good men confess that their hearts burn within them, and bad men, even an Agrippa, to say they are almost persuaded to be Christians, Ac 26:28. God is well pleased with Christ, and with us in him. This is the Messiah who was promised, through whom all who believe in him shall be accepted and saved. The truth and reality of the gospel also are foretold by the prophets and penmenof the Old Testament, who spake and wrote under influence, and according to the direction of the Spirit of God. How firm and sure should our faith be, who have such a firm and sure word to rest upon! When the light of the Scripture is darted into the blind mind and dark understanding, by the Holy Spirit of God, it is like the day-break that advances, and diffuses itself through the whole soul, till it makes perfect day. As the Scripture is the revelation of the mind and will of God, every man ought to search it, to understand the sense and meaning. The Christian knows that book to be the word of God, in which he tastes a sweetness, and feels a power, and sees a glory, truly divine. And the prophecies already fulfilled in the person and salvation of Christ, and in the great concerns of the church and the world, form an unanswerable proof of the truth of Christianity. The Holy Ghost inspired holy men to speak and write. He so assisted and directed them in delivering what they had received from him, that they clearly expressed what they made known. So that the Scriptures are to be accounted the words of the Holy Ghost, and all the plainness and simplicity, all the power and all the propriety of the words and expressions, come from God. Mix faith with what you find in the Scriptures, and esteem and reverence the Bible as a book written by holy men, taught by the Holy Ghost.</body></html>
