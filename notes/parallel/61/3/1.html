There is no indication that the first two chapters are one letter, and that this is the beginning of another, as has been supposed. With this use of "now," or "already," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-14.htm" title="This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.">John 21:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Pure minds.</span>--The word for "pure" means literally "separated"--according to one derivation, by being sifted; according to another, by being held up to the light. Hence it comes to mean "unsullied." Here it probably means untainted by sensuality or, possibly, deceit. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-10.htm" title="That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ.">Philippians 1:10</a>, the only other place where it occurs in the New Testament, it is translated "sincere." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2Corinthians 2:17</a>.) The word for "mind" means "the faculty of moral reflection and moral understanding," which St. Peter, in his First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm" title="Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;">2Peter 1:13</a>), tells his readers to brace up and keep ready for constant use. These very two words are found together in a beautiful passage in Plato's <span class= "ital">Phaedo, </span>66A.<p><span class= "bld">By way of remembrance.</span>--We have the same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm" title="Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;">2Peter 1:13</a>, and the translation in both cases should be the same--<span class= "ital">stir up in putting you in remembrance.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This Second Epistle, beloved, I now write unto you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">this Epistle already a second one I write unto you.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;</span> ("already") implies that the interval between the two Epistles was not long. The expression "beloved," four times repeated in this chapter, shows the apostle's affectionate interest in his readers; and the word "second" forces us to make our choice between the Petrine authorship of the Epistle or the hypothesis of a direct forgery. <span class="cmt_word">In both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in which, i.e.</span>, "Epistles;" the word "second" implied an allusion to a First Epistle. St. Peter repeats the words which he had used in chapter 2 Peter 1:13, "I think it meet... to stir you up by putting you in remembrance." Mind (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is the reflective faculty (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>); that faculty should be exercised in holy things. The thoughts that pass through the Christian's mind should be holy thoughts; his mind should be pure. The word rendered "pure" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-10.htm">Philippians 1:10</a> (where see note); the corresponding substantive is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>. It is said of things which can bear to be judged in the sunlight, and so means "pure, clear," or (according to another possible etymology) "unmixed," and so "genuine, sincere." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 The purified minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may be active and lively in the work of holiness. There will be scoffers in the last days, under the gospel, men who make light of sin, and mock at salvation by Jesus Christ. One very principal article of our faith refers to what only has a promise to rest upon, and scoffers will attack it till our Lord is come. They will not believe that he will come. Because they see no changes, therefore they fear not God, Ps 55:19. What he never has done, they fancy he never can do, or never will do.</body></html>
