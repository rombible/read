(For "the last days," see note on 1 Peter 1:20.) The Revised Version has, "Mockers shall come with mockery." This represents the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>, found in nearly all the best manuscripts, which give emphasis to the expression after the Hebrew manner. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, scoffers, only in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-18.htm">Jude 1:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Walking after their own lusts.</span> Self-indulgence often leads to skepticism. This verse is quoted in a homily ascribed to Hippolytus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 The purified minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may be active and lively in the work of holiness. There will be scoffers in the last days, under the gospel, men who make light of sin, and mock at salvation by Jesus Christ. One very principal article of our faith refers to what only has a promise to rest upon, and scoffers will attack it till our Lord is come. They will not believe that he will come. Because they see no changes, therefore they fear not God, Ps 55:19. What he never has done, they fancy he never can do, or never will do.</body></html>
