This repeated reproduction of words and ideas from one of the most impressive of Christ's discourses, which only St. Peter and three others seem to have heard, may fairly be added to the evidence in favour of the authenticity of the Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">With a great noise.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">with a rushing noise.</span> The expression occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but some such idea as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm" title="And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.">Revelation 6:14</a>, is probably indicated--not the roar of flames or the crash of ruins, but the parting and rolling up of the heavens. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The elements shall melt with fervent heat.</span>--The meaning of "elements" here is much disputed. (See Notes on the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>.) The difficulty of supposing fire to be destroyed by fire seems to exclude the four elements being intended; moreover, the earth is mentioned separately. Hence, some take "the elements" to mean water and air, the two remaining elements; but this is not very satisfactory. More probably, the various forms of matter in the universe are intended, without any thought of indicating what they are precisely. But seeing that Justin Martyr calls the sun, moon, and stars "heavenly elements" (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> II. v., <span class= "ital">Trypho, </span>xxiii.), and that in predictions of the last day frequent mention is made of "signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-24.htm" title="But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,">Mark 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm" title="And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;">Luke 21:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm" title="Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-31.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.">Joel 2:31</a>, &c), it is possible that the heavenly bodies are meant here, all the more so, as the mention of these "elements" immediately follows that of the heavens. Bengel (perhaps with more poetry than correctness) ingeniously connects this explanation with the radical signification of the word, viz., "letters of the alphabet," "for stars in the heaven are as letters on a scroll." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm" title="And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.">Revelation 6:14</a>.) "Shall melt" should rather be, as in the next two verses, <span class= "ital">shall be dissolved.</span> Wiclif has "dissolved," Rheims "resolved." This dissolution is the opposite of the consistency spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2Peter 3:5</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2Peter 3:12</a> "melt" is correct, and suits the heavenly bodies better than the four elements. (Comp. <span class= "ital">The Second Epistle of Clement, </span>xvi. 3.)<p><span class= "bld">The earth also and the works that are therein.</span>--Equivalent to "the earth and the fulness thereof," "works" being used in a comprehensive sense for products both of nature and art. The moral work of each individual is not meant; consequently, a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1Corinthians 3:13</a> is misleading. The two passages have little in common, and nothing is gained by bringing in the difficulties of the other passage here. In this passage the Apostle is stating plainly and in detail what some of the Prophets of the Old Testament had set forth in general and sometimes obscure language--that a judgment by fire is in store for the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/66-15.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-24.htm" title="And they shall go forth, and look on the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.">Isaiah 66:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm" title="For, behold, the day comes, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yes, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes shall burn them up, said the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.">Malachi 4:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Shall be burned up.</span>--The question of readings here is one of known difficulty. One important MS. has "shall vanish away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-14.htm" title="Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.">James 4:14</a>); two first-rate MSS. and other authorities have "shall be found." The later Syriac has "shall not be found," which is pretty nearly equivalent to "shall vanish away," and is sometimes given as exactly equivalent to it. "Shall be found," the reading most strongly attested, is summarily rejected by some editors as yielding no sense. The theory that it has grown out of the Latin for "shall be burned up"--<span class= "ital">eurethesetai</span> out of <span class= "ital">exurentur</span>--does not seem very probable. Nor is it true that it yields no sense By placing a colon at "also," and making what follows a question, we obtain--<span class= "ital">The elements shall be dissolved, the earth also: and shall the works that are therein be found?</span> Happily, nothing of importance turns on the reading; all the variations amount practically to the same thing--that the elements, the earth, and all that is in it, shall be destroyed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the day of the Lord will come.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, will come, stands emphatically at the beginning of the clause; whatever the mockers may say, whatever may happen, come certainly will the day of the Lord. "The day of the Lord" meets us often in the prophets; it is usually associated with the thought of judgment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>). In the New Testament it signifies the second advent of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a thief in the night.</span> The best manuscripts omit here "in the night." St. Peter is evidently echoing the Lord's words in that great prophetic discourse on the Mount of Olives, which must have made such a deep impression upon the apostles. This illustration of the sudden coming of the thief is repeated not only by St. Peter here, but also by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>), and twice by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a> and Revelation 16:15). <span class="cmt_word">In the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise.</span> The Greek for "with a great noise (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and is one of those remarkable poetic forms which are not unfrequent in this Epistle: the noun <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used of the whizzing of arrows, of the rush of wings, of the sound of mighty winds or roaring waters. It may be understood here of the crash of a falling world or of the roar of the destroying flames. The word rendered "pass away" is that used by our Lord in the prophecy just referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>; also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.</span> It is uncertain whether by "the elements" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) St. Peter means the four elements (in the old and popular use of the word), or the great constituent parts of the universe, the heavenly bodies. Against the first view is the assertion that one of those elements is to be the agent of destruction. But the word rendered "melt" means "shall be dissolved" or "loosed;" and it may be, as Bishop Wordsworth says, that "St. Peter's meaning seems to be that the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, elements or rudiments, of which the universe is composed and compacted, will be loosed; that is, the framework of the world will be disorganized; and this is the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> in the LXX. (Wisd. 7:17 Wisd. 19:17) and in Hippolytus, 'Philos.,' pages 219, 318. The dissolution is contrasted with the consistency described by the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in verse 5. The heavens are reserved for fire, and will pass away with a rushing noise, and, being set on fire, will be dissolved; the elements will be on fire and melt, and he reduced to a state of confusion; the earth and the works therein will be burnt up. There does not seem, therefore, to be any cause for abandoning the common meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, the elemental principles of which the universe is made." On the other hand, the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> is certainly used of the heavenly bodies by Justin Martyr ('Apolog.,' 2. c. 5, and 'Dial. cum Tryphon,' c. 23); and the heavenly bodies are constantly mentioned in the descriptions of the awful convulsions of the great day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-24.htm">Mark 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, etc.). The objection that the word does not bear this meaning elsewhere in Holy Scripture is of little weight, as this is the only place in which it has a physical sense. The literal translation of the clause is, "The elements, being scorched, shall be dissolved." The word for "being scorched" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs in the New Testament only here and in verse 12; it is used by the Greek physicians of the burning heat of fever. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "shall be dissolved or loosened." <span class="cmt_word">The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</span> By "the works that are therein" St. Peter seems to mean all the works both of God and of man, "opera naturae et artis" (Bengel). There is a very remarkable reading here (supported by the Sinaitic and Vatican and another uncial manuscript), <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall be discovered," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall be burned up." If we understand "the works that are therein" of man's works and actions, this reading will give a good sense (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, "Every man's work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is"). Or the clause may be regarded as interrogative, "Shall the earth and the works that are therein be found?" But the reading, "shall be burned up" is well supported, and suits the context best. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-10 Had these scoffers considered the dreadful vengeance with which God swept away a whole world of ungodly men at once, surely they would not have scoffed at his threatening an equally terrible judgment. The heavens and the earth which now are, by the same word, it is declared, will be destroyed by fire. This is as sure to come, as the truth and the power of God can make it. Christians are here taught and established in the truth of the coming of the Lord. Though, in the account of men, there is a vast difference between one day and a thousand years, yet, in the account of God, there is no difference. All things past, present, and future, are ever before him: the delay of a thousand years cannot be so much to him, as putting off any thing for a day or for an hour is to us. If men have no knowledge or belief of the eternal God, they will be very apt to think him such as themselves. How hard is it to form any thoughts of eternity! What men count slackness, is long-suffering, and that to us-ward; it is giving more time to hisown people, to advance in knowledge and holiness, and in the exercise of faith and patience, to abound in good works, doing and suffering what they are called to, that they may bring glory to God. Settle therefore in your hearts that you shall certainly be called to give an account of all things done in the body, whether good or evil. And let a humble and diligent walking before God, and a frequent judging of yourselves, show a firm belief of the future judgment, though many live as if they were never to give any account at all. This day will come, when men are secure, and have no expectation of the day of the Lord. The stately palaces, and all the desirable things wherein wordly-minded men seek and place their happiness, shall be burned up; all sorts of creatures God has made, and all the works of men, must pass through the fire, which shall be a consuming fire to all that sin has brought into the world, though a refining fire to the works of God's hand. What will become of us, if we set our affections on this earth, and make it our portion, seeing all these things shall be burned up? Therefore make sure of happiness beyond this visible world.</body></html>
