(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-17.htm" title="But, beloved, remember you the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;">Jude 1:17</a>.) The coherence of the Epistle as a whole comes out strongly in this last chapter: <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm" title="This second letter, beloved, I now write to you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:">2Peter 3:1</a> recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-12.htm" title="Why I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth.">2Peter 1:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-17.htm" title="You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.">2Peter 3:17</a> recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-10.htm" title="Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:">2Peter 1:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

In this verse the Apostle commends the warnings of the Old Testament and the New Testament, as to the coming of Christ, to Christians throughout all ages.<p><span class= "bld">The commandment of us the apostles of the Lord.</span>--"Of us" is, beyond all doubt, a false reading; it should be "of you," or "your." The Greek is somewhat awkward, owing to the number of genitives, but the order of the words is conclusive as to the meaning--<span class= "ital">the commandment of your Apostles</span> (or rather) <span class= "ital">of the Lord and Saviour.</span> The commandment is at once a commandment of the Apostles and of the Lord. "The Apostles of the Lord" must not be taken together, as in our version. The expression "your Apostles" may be taken as a mark of genuineness rather than of the contrary. It is at least not improbable that a true Apostle, having once stated his credentials (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>), would sink his own personality in the group of his colleagues from a feeling of humility and of delicacy towards those whom he was addressing, especially when they owed their Christianity mainly to other Apostles than himself. It is not improbable that a writer personating an Apostle would have insisted on his assumed personality and personal authority here.<p>What commandment is meant? Surely not the whole Christian law; but either the command to beware of false teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-15.htm" title="Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.">Matthew 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-5.htm" title="For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.">Matthew 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-11.htm" title="And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.">Matthew 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm" title="For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.">Mark 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-17.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them.">Romans 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm" title="Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God on the children of disobedience.">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-3.htm" title="For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;">2Timothy 4:3</a>), or, more probably, what is the main subject of this Epistle, to be ready for Christ's coming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.">Matthew 24:36-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-35.htm" title="Watch you therefore: for you know not when the master of the house comes, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:">Mark 13:35-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-40.htm" title="Be you therefore ready also: for the Son of man comes at an hour when you think not.">Luke 12:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2-4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets.</span> "That ye may be mindful" is represented by one word in the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); compare the exact parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-72.htm">Luke 1:72</a>. Great stress is laid on the word of prophecy in both Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>). And of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles.</span> All the best manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> here. It is a remarkable expression; but Christ's apostles can be rightly called the apostles of those to whom they are sent, as being their teachers, sent to them for their benefit; just as the angels of God are called also the angels of Christ's little ones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a>). Compare also "the angels of the seven Churches" in the Revelation. St. Peter shows an intimate knowledge of several of St. Paul's Epistles, and of that of St. James; he is writing to the Churches addressed in his First Epistle, most of which were founded by St. Paul or his companions. We must therefore understand this passage, as well as verse 15 of this chapter, as a distinct recognition of the apostleship of St. Paul. The translation of the Authorized Version, "the apostles of the Lord and Saviour," involves a violent disturbance of the order; it seems best to make both genitives depend on "commandment:" "your apostles' commandment of the Lord;" the first genitive being that of announcement, the second of origin. The commandment was announced by the apostles, but it was the Lord's commandment. (For the double genitive, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>. For the whole verse, see the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-17.htm">Jude 1:17</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 The purified minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may be active and lively in the work of holiness. There will be scoffers in the last days, under the gospel, men who make light of sin, and mock at salvation by Jesus Christ. One very principal article of our faith refers to what only has a promise to rest upon, and scoffers will attack it till our Lord is come. They will not believe that he will come. Because they see no changes, therefore they fear not God, Ps 55:19. What he never has done, they fancy he never can do, or never will do.</body></html>
