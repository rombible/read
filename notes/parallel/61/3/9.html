As St. Augustine puts it, God is <span class= "ital">patiens quia aeternus</span>--longsuffering because He is eternal. He who is from everlasting to everlasting can afford to wait. (Comp. the <span class= "ital">Shepherd, Sim.</span> VIII. xi. 1.)<p><span class= "bld">To us-ward.</span>--The true reading, beyond all doubt, is <span class= "ital">towards you.</span> It is specially natural here that St. Peter should not include himself among those whom he addresses; for he is writing mainly to Gentile Christians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>), and this longsuffering of God had been conspicuous in His dealings with the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.">Romans 11:11-36</a>.) (See second Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness.</span> The Lord here, as frequently in these Epistles, is God the Father; it is he only who knoweth that day and that hour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>). Some take the genitive <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> with "the Lord," and translate, "The Lord of the promise is not slack." This is a possible connection, but, not so satisfactory as the ordinary rendering. (For the genitive with the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, see Winer, 3:30, 6, b.) The latter clause may be understood, "as some think it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the delay of the judgment, to be slackness;" or better, perhaps, "as some understand the meaning of slackness." Men are slow in fulfilling their promises from various, often selfish, motives; the Lord's delay comes from love and long-suffering. But is long-suffering to us-ward; rather, to <span class="accented">you-ward</span>, which seems to be the best-supported reading; two ancient manuscripts give "for your sake." St. Peter has the same thought in the First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4.htm">1 Peter 4</a>:20); there he reminds us how the long-suffering of God waited while the ark was a-preparing; here he tells us that the delay of the judgment, at which unbelievers scoff, is due to the same cause. We note here an item of evidence for the common authorship of the two Epistles (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>, and Ecclus. 32:22, in the Septuagint; also Augustine's well-known words, "Pattens quid aeternus"). <span class="cmt_word">Not willing that any should perish;</span> rather, <span class="accented">not wishing or desiring</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The participle gives the reason of the Lord's delay; he hath no pleasure that the wicked should die (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23, 32</a>, and Ezekiel 33:11). <span class="cmt_word">But that all should come to repentance.</span> The G reek word for "come" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), occurs in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-17.htm">Matthew 15:17</a> (see also the remarkable parallel from Plutarch, 'De Flum.,' page 19 (quoted by Alford), <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Calvin takes it transitively, "willing to <span class="accented">receive</span> all to repentance." But the common translation is plainly right (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a> combined with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-10 Had these scoffers considered the dreadful vengeance with which God swept away a whole world of ungodly men at once, surely they would not have scoffed at his threatening an equally terrible judgment. The heavens and the earth which now are, by the same word, it is declared, will be destroyed by fire. This is as sure to come, as the truth and the power of God can make it. Christians are here taught and established in the truth of the coming of the Lord. Though, in the account of men, there is a vast difference between one day and a thousand years, yet, in the account of God, there is no difference. All things past, present, and future, are ever before him: the delay of a thousand years cannot be so much to him, as putting off any thing for a day or for an hour is to us. If men have no knowledge or belief of the eternal God, they will be very apt to think him such as themselves. How hard is it to form any thoughts of eternity! What men count slackness, is long-suffering, and that to us-ward; it is giving more time to hisown people, to advance in knowledge and holiness, and in the exercise of faith and patience, to abound in good works, doing and suffering what they are called to, that they may bring glory to God. Settle therefore in your hearts that you shall certainly be called to give an account of all things done in the body, whether good or evil. And let a humble and diligent walking before God, and a frequent judging of yourselves, show a firm belief of the future judgment, though many live as if they were never to give any account at all. This day will come, when men are secure, and have no expectation of the day of the Lord. The stately palaces, and all the desirable things wherein wordly-minded men seek and place their happiness, shall be burned up; all sorts of creatures God has made, and all the works of men, must pass through the fire, which shall be a consuming fire to all that sin has brought into the world, though a refining fire to the works of God's hand. What will become of us, if we set our affections on this earth, and make it our portion, seeing all these things shall be burned up? Therefore make sure of happiness beyond this visible world.</body></html>
