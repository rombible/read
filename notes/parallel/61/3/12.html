The margin is probably right, <span class= "ital">hasting the coming</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>hastening Christ's coming by holy lives, by helping to make the Gospel known to all nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm" title="And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come.">Matthew 24:14</a>), so as to "accomplish the number of the elect," and by praying "Thy kingdom come." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.">Revelation 22:20</a>.) The thought is singularly parallel to St. Peter's speech in Solomon's Porch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/3-19.htm" title="Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.">Acts 3:19-21</a>, where see Notes); and as the thought is striking and unusual--perhaps nowhere else in the New Testament distinctly--this coincidence may fairly be admitted as a note of genuineness.<p><span class= "bld">The coming of the day of God.</span>--A phrase which occurs here only. It is doubly remarkable: (1) "coming," in the special sense indicated by the particular word used in the Greek, is elsewhere used of Christ Himself, not of the day; (2) "the day of God" is a very unusual expression.<p><span class= "bld">Wherein.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">by reason of which, </span>either "the day" or "the coming" being meant.<p><span class= "bld">Shall melt.</span>--"Melt" is here correct, being quite a different word from that rendered "melt" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10</a>, which is the same as that here translated "be dissolved." In the so-called <span class= "ital">Second Epistle of Clement</span> (chap. 16) we have a somewhat similar passage--"The day of judgment cometh even now <span class= "ital">as a burning oven</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm" title="For, behold, the day comes, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yes, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes shall burn them up, said the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.">Malachi 4:1</a>), and <span class= "ital">[the powers] of the heavens shall melt, </span>and all the earth as lead melting on the fire."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God.</span> The preposition "unto" is inserted without authority. The second participle <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is followed directly by the accusative, and is evidently transitive. In the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> represents the "hasting righteousness" of our translation (comp. Pindar, 'Isthm.,' 5:22, where <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> means "to pursue virtue"). Here the translation "hastening" is most appropriate. The Father hath put the times and seasons in his own power; but as the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, so now he is "long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish;" and in his gracious mercy waits for the repentance of his chosen. St. Peter seems to represent Christians as "hastening the coming [literally, 'presence'] of the day of God" by working out their own salvation, and helping to spread the knowledge of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>), and so rendering the long-suffering patience of God no longer necessary. The words imply also the duty of praying for that coming, as we do in the second petition of the Lord's Prayer, and in the Funeral Service, "Beseeching thee, that it may please thee, of thy gracious goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of thine elect, and to hasten thy kingdom." Compare St. Peter's speech in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3.htm">Acts 3</a>, where he says, "Repent ye therefore... that so (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>) there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ" (verses 19, 20, Revised Version). This remarkable coincidence of thought furnishes an argument of considerable weight in favour of the genuineness of this Epistle. Another possible rendering of the word is "earnestly desiring," which is adopted in the text of the Revised Version, and is preferred by some commentators. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved.</span> The Greek for "wherein" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span>,' <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bd;</span>, on account of which, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on account of the day of God, or, what comes to much the same meaning, on account of the coming, the presence, of that day. Old things must pass away because of the coming of the day of God; the old order must give place to new. <span class="cmt_word">And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.</span> The apostle repeats the striking words which he had already used in verse 10, with a different verb. The Greek word for "shall melt" here is not <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as in verse 10, but a stronger word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, are being melted, or wasted away. The tense is the prophetic present, implying a certain fulfillment. There is probably a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>, where the Septuagint rendering is <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-18 From the doctrine of Christ's second coming, we are exhorted to purity and godliness. This is the effect of real knowledge. Very exact and universal holiness is enjoined, not resting in any low measure or degree. True Christians look for new heavens and a new earth; freed from the vanity to which things present are subject, and the sin they are polluted with. Those only who are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, shall be admitted to dwell in this holy place. He is faithful, who has promised. Those, whose sins are pardoned, and their peace made with God, are the only safe and happy people; therefore follow after peace, and that with all men; follow after holiness as well as peace. Never expect to be found at that day of God in peace, if you are lazy and idle in this your day, in which we must finish the work given us to do. Only the diligent Christian will be the happy Christian in the day of the Lord. Our Lord will suddenly come to us, or shortly call us to him; and shall he find us idle? Learn to make a right use of the patience of our Lord, who as yet delays his coming. Proud, carnal, and corrupt men, seek to wrest some things into a seeming agreement with their wicked doctrines. But this is no reason why St. Paul's epistles, or any other part of the Scriptures, should be laid aside; for men, left to themselves, pervert every gift of God. Then let us seek to have our minds prepared for receiving things hard to be understood, by putting in practice things which are more easy to be understood. But there must be self-denial and suspicion of ourselves, and submission to the authority of Christ Jesus, before we can heartily receive all the truths of the gospel, therefore we are in great danger of rejecting the truth. And whatever opinions and thoughts of men are not according to the law of God, and warranted by it, the believer disclaims and abhors. Those who are led away by error, fall from their own stedfastness. And that we may avoid being led away, we must seek to grow in all grace, in faith, and virtue, and knowledge. Labour to know Christ more clearly, and more fully; to know him so as to be more like him, and to love him better. This is the knowledge of Christ, which the apostle Paul reached after, and desired to attain; and those who taste this effect of the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, will, upon receiving such grace from him, give thanks and praise him, and join in ascribing glory to him now, in the full assurance of doing the same hereafter, for ever.</body></html>
