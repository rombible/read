"His word" here does not mean any single utterance of God or passage of Scripture, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-15.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.">Isaiah 66:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm" title="For, behold, the day comes, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yes, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes shall burn them up, said the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.">Malachi 4:1</a>. Just as "the world that then was" was destroyed by water, so the present world is being treasured up to be destroyed by fire. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a>. Christ Himself, in a discourse which St. Peter heard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>), had made the Flood a type of the Judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-37.htm" title="But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:37-39</a>). (See below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10</a>.) "Unto fire," or "for fire," should perhaps be taken with "kept in store" rather than with "reserved."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the heavens and the earth, which are now;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the heavens which are now, and the earth.</span> The "now" does not refer, as some think, to any change wrought by the Flood, but distinguishes the present heavens and earth from the new heavens and new earth, which Christians are to look for (verse 13). By the same Word are kept in store, reserved unto fire. Several of the better manuscripts have "by his Word," which, on the whole, seems to give the best meaning. The reading in the text may, indeed, be understood in a similar sense, "by the same Word of God;" otherwise it would mean that the original word of creation determined also the duration of the world and the means of its destruction. The words rendered, "are kept in store," are, literally, "have been treasured (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>)" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>). It seems better to take the dative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> ("with fire," or "for fire") with this verb rather than with the following, as in the Authorized Version. If we take the first meaning of the dative, the sense will be that the world has been stored <span class="accented">with</span> fire, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that it contains, stored up in its inner depths, the fire which is destined ultimately to destroy it. But the other view seems on the whole more probable; the heavens and the earth are stored up <span class="accented">for</span> fire or unto fire, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with the purpose in the counsels of God of their ultimate destruction by fire. This is the clearest prophecy in Holy Scripture of the final conflagration of the universe; but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>. Such a doctrine formed part of the physical theories of the Stoics; it is also found in the 'Book of Enoch.' <span class="cmt_word">Against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</span> The participle "reserved" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is best taken with this clause: "Reserved against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-10 Had these scoffers considered the dreadful vengeance with which God swept away a whole world of ungodly men at once, surely they would not have scoffed at his threatening an equally terrible judgment. The heavens and the earth which now are, by the same word, it is declared, will be destroyed by fire. This is as sure to come, as the truth and the power of God can make it. Christians are here taught and established in the truth of the coming of the Lord. Though, in the account of men, there is a vast difference between one day and a thousand years, yet, in the account of God, there is no difference. All things past, present, and future, are ever before him: the delay of a thousand years cannot be so much to him, as putting off any thing for a day or for an hour is to us. If men have no knowledge or belief of the eternal God, they will be very apt to think him such as themselves. How hard is it to form any thoughts of eternity! What men count slackness, is long-suffering, and that to us-ward; it is giving more time to hisown people, to advance in knowledge and holiness, and in the exercise of faith and patience, to abound in good works, doing and suffering what they are called to, that they may bring glory to God. Settle therefore in your hearts that you shall certainly be called to give an account of all things done in the body, whether good or evil. And let a humble and diligent walking before God, and a frequent judging of yourselves, show a firm belief of the future judgment, though many live as if they were never to give any account at all. This day will come, when men are secure, and have no expectation of the day of the Lord. The stately palaces, and all the desirable things wherein wordly-minded men seek and place their happiness, shall be burned up; all sorts of creatures God has made, and all the works of men, must pass through the fire, which shall be a consuming fire to all that sin has brought into the world, though a refining fire to the works of God's hand. What will become of us, if we set our affections on this earth, and make it our portion, seeing all these things shall be burned up? Therefore make sure of happiness beyond this visible world.</body></html>
