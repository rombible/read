"Out of [the] water" indicates the material out of which the earth was made; not, as our version leads us to suppose, that out of which the earth rose, like an island from the ocean. "In the water" is wrong, and again the error is probably derived from Geneva, though Tyndale has it also. We should render rather, <span class= "ital">by means of [the] water.</span> In both clauses the article should perhaps be omitted--<span class= "ital">the earth consisting out of water and through water.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-2.htm" title="For he has founded it on the seas, and established it on the floods.">Psalm 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-6.htm" title="To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 136:6</a>.) In the <span class= "ital">Clementine Homilies</span> (XI. xxiv.) we have the idea of all things being made by water. In the Greek "by the word of God comes last, not first; emphasis is obtained either way. "By the word of God;" not by a fortuitous concourse of atoms, not by spontaneous generation. In the <span class= "ital">Shepherd</span> of Hermas (I. <span class= "ital">Vis.</span> I. iii. 4) we read, "Behold, the God of virtues (powers). . . . by His mighty word has fixed the heaven, and laid the foundation of the earth upon the waters." (See above on ii. 1, 3, 13, 15, 20.) In an <span class= "ital">Apology</span> of Melito, Bishop of Sardis, addressed to Antoninus Caesar about A.D. 170, there is a passage bearing a considerable amount of resemblance to these verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2Peter 3:5-7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this they willingly are ignorant of;</span> literally, for <span class="accented">this escapes them of their own will.</span> All things have not always been as they are; there have been great changes; there was once a great catastrophe; but this they willfully forget, Huther translates differently, "For, whilst they assert this, it is hidden from them that," etc. But this rendering seems forced and unsatisfactory, and gives a meaning to <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> which it has nowhere in the New Testament. <span class="cmt_word">That by the Word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water.</span> The Revised Version translates, <span class="accented">That there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the Word of God.</span> The mockers say that all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation. That creation itself was a great, a stupendous change, a mighty effort of the power of God. St. Peter refers to it in words evidently derived from the Book of Genesis, not from any other sources, whether Greek, Egyptian, or Indian. There were heavens from of old (the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a>). There was an earth formed or standing out of the water. The Greek participle here used is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, literally, "standing together or consisting" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>); it may be taken closely with both prepositional Clauses, "earth consisting of water and by means of water." Thales had taught that water was the beginning of things, the original element (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); the narrative in Genesis represents water as originally overspreading all things: "The earth was without form [<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint], and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." We may therefore understand St. Peter as meaning that the earth was formed or compacted out of water, or out of those substances which the water at first held in solution; and that it is kept together in coherence and solidity by means of water. If, on the other hand, we regard the participle as closely connected with the second preposition only, the meaning will be that the earth, held together and compacted by means of water, rose up out of the water, and appeared above it, when God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear." It is possible, again, to understand the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> locally, and to translate "amidst water." Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a>, "He stretched out the earth above the waters;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>, "He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods." Of course, neither St. Peter nor Moses is speaking in the language of science; their object was, not to teach scientific truth, but to present the great fact of creation in an aspect suitable to our poor capacities. For the clause, "by the Word of God (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>)," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)." St. Peter may be referring to the formula, "And God said," so constantly repeated in the account of the creation, or (what is really the same truth) to the fact that "all things were made by him [by God the Word], and without him was not anything made that was made." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:5-10 Had these scoffers considered the dreadful vengeance with which God swept away a whole world of ungodly men at once, surely they would not have scoffed at his threatening an equally terrible judgment. The heavens and the earth which now are, by the same word, it is declared, will be destroyed by fire. This is as sure to come, as the truth and the power of God can make it. Christians are here taught and established in the truth of the coming of the Lord. Though, in the account of men, there is a vast difference between one day and a thousand years, yet, in the account of God, there is no difference. All things past, present, and future, are ever before him: the delay of a thousand years cannot be so much to him, as putting off any thing for a day or for an hour is to us. If men have no knowledge or belief of the eternal God, they will be very apt to think him such as themselves. How hard is it to form any thoughts of eternity! What men count slackness, is long-suffering, and that to us-ward; it is giving more time to hisown people, to advance in knowledge and holiness, and in the exercise of faith and patience, to abound in good works, doing and suffering what they are called to, that they may bring glory to God. Settle therefore in your hearts that you shall certainly be called to give an account of all things done in the body, whether good or evil. And let a humble and diligent walking before God, and a frequent judging of yourselves, show a firm belief of the future judgment, though many live as if they were never to give any account at all. This day will come, when men are secure, and have no expectation of the day of the Lord. The stately palaces, and all the desirable things wherein wordly-minded men seek and place their happiness, shall be burned up; all sorts of creatures God has made, and all the works of men, must pass through the fire, which shall be a consuming fire to all that sin has brought into the world, though a refining fire to the works of God's hand. What will become of us, if we set our affections on this earth, and make it our portion, seeing all these things shall be burned up? Therefore make sure of happiness beyond this visible world.</body></html>
