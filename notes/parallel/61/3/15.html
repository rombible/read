The two intermediate <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2Peter 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm" title="And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;">2Peter 3:15</a>, are open to dispute. The fact that "our" appears in this verse before "Lord," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.">2Peter 3:18</a>, inclines the balance here towards the meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.">2Peter 3:18</a>. Moreover, had God been meant, it would have sufficed to say, "and account that <span class= "ital">His</span> long-suffering is salvation." If this is correct, and "our Lord" means Jesus Christ, "then throughout this weighty passage the Lord Jesus is invested with the full attributes of Deity." Here, possibly, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a> (see Note), the expression points to the writer's entire belief in the unity of the two Persons. <span class= "ital">Account the longsuffering of our Lord salvation</span> instead of accounting it to be "slackness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2Peter 3:9</a>); make use of it for working out your own salvation in fear and trembling, instead of criticising it.<p><span class= "bld">As our beloved brother Paul.</span>--This may possibly mean something more than that St. Paul was a fellow-Christian and a personal friend--viz., that he was a fellow-worker and brother-evangelist. More than this it cannot well mean, though some interpret it "brother-Apostle." Tychicus is twice called "beloved brother" by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7</a>), and the addition of "our" here can make no such change of meaning. It is doubtful whether there is any allusion to the dispute between St. Peter and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11</a>), although an expression of marked affection would be quite in place as evidence that all such differences were now forgotten. In any case the familiarity and equality which the expression "our beloved brother Paul" implies should be noticed. It is in marked contrast to the way in which Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Polycarp, and Clement of Alexandria speak of St. Paul, and in this way is a decided note of genuineness. A writer of the sub-Apostolic age would not easily be able to free himself from the feeling of the age in this respect. Clement of Rome (<span class= "ital">Corinthians, </span>xlvii. 1), says, "Take up the Epistle of <span class= "ital">the blessed Paul the Apostle.</span>" Ignatius (<span class= "ital">Ephesians, </span>12:2) calls him "<span class= "ital">Paul the sanctified, the martyred, worthily called blessed."</span> Polycarp (see next Note) calls him "<span class= "ital">the blessed and glorious Paul," </span>or "<span class= "ital">the blessed Paul."</span> Clement of Alexandria commonly says simply "<span class= "ital">the Apostle," </span>but sometimes "<span class= "ital">the divine Apostle"</span> or "<span class= "ital">the noble Apostle."</span> An imitator in the second century would scarcely have attained to the freedom of "our beloved brother Paul."<p><span class= "bld">According to the wisdom given unto him.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>. Polycarp, in his <span class= "ital">Epistle to the Philippians</span> (2peter iii. 2), says, "Neither I nor any one else like me can equal the <span class= "ital">wisdom</span> of the blessed and glorious Paul, who . . . <span class= "ital">wrote letters to you, </span>into which if ye look diligently, &c. &c." This seems to show that St. Paul's letters had already become the common property of the churches.<p><span class= "bld">Hath written unto you.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">wrote to you.</span> What Epistle, or Epistles, are here meant? Few points in this Epistle have been more debated. The following are some of the many answers that have been given to the question: (1) a lost Epistle; (2) Hebrews, because of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-23.htm" title="Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)">Hebrews 10:23-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm" title="For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.">Hebrews 10:37</a>; (3) Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, because our Epistle is supposed to be addressed to the Christians of Asia Minor; (4) Ephesians only, for the reason just stated, and because Colossians and Galatians contain little or no mention of the day of judgment; also because of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>, and the encyclical character of the Epistle; (5) 1 Corinthians, because of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-7.htm" title="So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1Corinthians 1:7-9</a>; (6) Romans, because of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm" title="Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?">Romans 2:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22-23</a>; (7) 1 and 2 Thessalonians, because of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.">1Thessalonians 5:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>, because <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10</a> recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>, also because "things hard to be understood" admirably describes much of 2 Thessalonians 2, which treats of the time of Christ's coming, the very subject here under discussion.<p>Of these seven theories, (1) can neither be proved nor disproved; (3) and (4) lose much of their weight when we consider that the persons addressed in 2 Peter are nowhere defined, excepting that to some extent they are identical with those addressed in 1 Peter. Of the remaining four, (7) seems to be very probable, both on account of the large amount of coincidence, and also because of the early date of those Epistles, allowing an interval of fifteen years, in which the two Epistles might easily have become well known in other churches. Still it is difficult to find a passage in them about the <span class= "ital">longsuffering</span> of God, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm" title="Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22-23</a>. And when we consider that Romans also Appears to have been an Encyclical Letter, and was written not so very long after the Epistles to the Thessalonians; that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-8.htm" title="And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.">Romans 3:8</a>. St. Paul himself tells us that he had been grossly misunderstood; that <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a> might easily cause serious misunderstanding, and that <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?">Romans 6:16</a> seems to be recalled in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-19.htm" title="While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.">2Peter 2:19</a>--it will perhaps be thought that on the whole Romans best answers to the requirements of the context.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation.</span> The apostle is referring to verse 9. Scoffers count the delay of the judgment slackness; the Christian should count it salvation; it is for the salvation of the elect that the judgment tarrieth. It is almost certain that by "our Lord" here St. Peter means the Lord Jesus, whom he describes by the same title in verse 18. Even as our beloved brother Paul also. The plural pronoun may be intended to imply that St. Paul was known to the Churches to which St. Peter was writing, and was beloved there. St. Peter addresses his readers as "beloved" four times in this Epistle; he here uses the same epithet of St. Paul. It comes naturally from his lips; but a writer of the second century would probably have used much stronger words of praise in speaking of one so much reverenced. According to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; rather, <span class="accented">wrote to you</span> (comp. Polycarp, 'Ad Philipp.,' 1:3, "One like me cannot equal the wisdom of the blessed Paul"). That wisdom was given mite him, as he himself says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>). If we ask to what Epistles of St. Paul is St. Peter referring, the passage which at once occurs to us is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4</a> and 5. This Epistle was probably known to St. Peter; there may be a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a> in verse 10 of this chapter; and Silvanus, whose name St. Paul associates with his own in both Epistles to the Thessalonians, was with St. Peter when he wrote his First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). But St. Peter's Second Epistle is addressed (primarily at least) to the same Churches to which the first was written (chapter 3:1). We must therefore either say, with Dean Alford, that "our Epistle belongs to a date when the Pauline Epistles were no longer the property only of the Churches to which they were written, but were dispersed through, and considered to belong to, the whole Christian Church;" or we must suppose that the passages in St. Peter's thoughts were not in the Epistle to the Thessalonians, but in some of the Epistles addressed to the Churches of Asia Minor; as, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 24</a>; or, possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a> and Romans 9:22, as there seem to be some reasons for believing that this last Epistle was addressed to the Church at Ephesus among others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-18 From the doctrine of Christ's second coming, we are exhorted to purity and godliness. This is the effect of real knowledge. Very exact and universal holiness is enjoined, not resting in any low measure or degree. True Christians look for new heavens and a new earth; freed from the vanity to which things present are subject, and the sin they are polluted with. Those only who are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, shall be admitted to dwell in this holy place. He is faithful, who has promised. Those, whose sins are pardoned, and their peace made with God, are the only safe and happy people; therefore follow after peace, and that with all men; follow after holiness as well as peace. Never expect to be found at that day of God in peace, if you are lazy and idle in this your day, in which we must finish the work given us to do. Only the diligent Christian will be the happy Christian in the day of the Lord. Our Lord will suddenly come to us, or shortly call us to him; and shall he find us idle? Learn to make a right use of the patience of our Lord, who as yet delays his coming. Proud, carnal, and corrupt men, seek to wrest some things into a seeming agreement with their wicked doctrines. But this is no reason why St. Paul's epistles, or any other part of the Scriptures, should be laid aside; for men, left to themselves, pervert every gift of God. Then let us seek to have our minds prepared for receiving things hard to be understood, by putting in practice things which are more easy to be understood. But there must be self-denial and suspicion of ourselves, and submission to the authority of Christ Jesus, before we can heartily receive all the truths of the gospel, therefore we are in great danger of rejecting the truth. And whatever opinions and thoughts of men are not according to the law of God, and warranted by it, the believer disclaims and abhors. Those who are led away by error, fall from their own stedfastness. And that we may avoid being led away, we must seek to grow in all grace, in faith, and virtue, and knowledge. Labour to know Christ more clearly, and more fully; to know him so as to be more like him, and to love him better. This is the knowledge of Christ, which the apostle Paul reached after, and desired to attain; and those who taste this effect of the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, will, upon receiving such grace from him, give thanks and praise him, and join in ascribing glory to him now, in the full assurance of doing the same hereafter, for ever.</body></html>
