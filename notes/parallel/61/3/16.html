The expression does not necessarily Imply that St. Paul was dead, and that his Epistles had been collected into one volume. That each church made a collection of them as they became known to it, and that in the great centres they became known soon after they were written, are conjectures of great probability.<p><span class= "bld">Speaking in them of these things</span>--viz., of the return of Christ and of the destruction of the world. Some, however, understand the words as meaning the exhortations to holiness here given.<p><span class= "bld">Some things hard to be understood.</span>--Certainly the difficulties with which 2 Thessalonians 2 bristles are well described by this expression, and they relate to the very point in question--the time of Christ's coming. Moreover, scoffers could easily turn them to account by arguing that "the man of sin" had not yet appeared, and that therefore there was no likelihood of the end of the world coming just yet. But in admitting that 2 Thessalonians 2 is among the passages alluded to here, we are not committed to the theory that 1 and 2 Thess. are alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm" title="And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;">2Peter 3:15</a>. Many refer these words to St. Paul's doctrine of justification by faith as wrested to mean "faith without works." So, again, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5-6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a> might be wrested to mean that "the resurrection is past already" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-18.htm" title="Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.">2Timothy 2:18</a>). (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-8.htm" title="And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.">Romans 3:8</a> respecting perversion of his teaching.)<p><span class= "bld">Unlearned and unstable.</span>--The word for "unlearned" here is not the same as that translated "unlearned" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm" title="Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.">Acts 4:13</a>. (See Note there.) That signifies "without special study;" this means "without ordinary instruction." Ignorance naturally produces instability; those who have no clear principles of Christian doctrine easily fall victims to seductions of all kinds. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2Peter 2:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Wrest.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">torture by means of the rack;</span> and hence "strain," "distort." That St. Paul's doctrine of Christian liberty, as opposed to the bondage of the Law, was seen by himself to be liable to great abuse, and had already begun to be abused, we learn from his own writings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.">1Corinthians 6:12-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13-26</a>; where see Notes. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The other scriptures.</span>--The Old Testament cannot well be meant. St. Peter would scarcely have placed the writings of a contemporary side by side with the Scriptures of the Old Testament (the canon of which had long since been closed) without some intimation of a grouping which at that time must have been novel, and probably was quite unknown. It is much more probable that Christian writings of some kind are intended, but we can only conjecture which, any of the canonical writings of the New Testament then in existence, and perhaps some that are not canonical. That an Apostle should speak of the writings of a brother-Apostle in the same <span class= "ital">terms</span> as the books of the Old Testament--viz., as <span class= "ital">Scripture</span>--need not surprise us, especially when we remember the large claims made by St. Paul for his own words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3-5</a>. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm" title="For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things;">Acts 15:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-18.htm" title="For I testify to every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book:">Revelation 22:18-19</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>, Evangelists are almost made superior to the Old Testament Prophets--a statement indicating a view which harmonises well both with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2Peter 1:15-19</a> and with the view set forth here; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2Peter 1:15</a> he assigns to this Epistle much the same purpose as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a> he assigns to the Old Testament Prophets. Moreover, we have seen how Clement of Rome uses the term "Scripture" of a passage which comes from some uncanonical book (see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>). See <span class= "ital">Introduction, </span>I. c. <span class= "greekheb"></span>. 4.<p><span class= "bld">Unto their own destruction.</span>--The Greek is very emphatic as to its being "their own." (Comp. "Bring upon themselves swift destruction," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>.) It is their own doing--St. Paul and other writers of Scripture are not to blame; and it befits them--they will find the end they deserve. This passage gives no countenance to the Roman doctrine that all Scripture is hard to understand, and therefore not to be read by the people. All that is here said is that <span class= "ital">some</span> Scripture is hard to understand, and that bad men make a bad use of the fact. The inference drawn from this by St. Peter is not, "Do not read Scripture," nor even "Pass over what seems to be hard," but "Be on your guard against being led astray by interpretations contrary to the spirit of the gospel."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As also in all his Epistles.</span> The true reading is probably <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> without the article. The words, therefore, do not imply the existence of a complete collection of St. Paul's Epistles, but mean only "in all Epistles which he writes." <span class="cmt_word">Speaking in them of these things;</span> that is, of the day of God, the end of the world, etc. St. Peter was acquainted with other Epistles of St. Paul besides those addressed to the Asiatic Churches. There are evident indications of his knowledge of the Epistles to the Thessalonians and Corinthians, as well as of that to the Romans. <span class="cmt_word">In which are some things hard to be understood.</span> The manuscripts vary between <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. The first reading would refer to the words immediately preceding - "these things;" "among the subjects on which St. Paul wrote there are some things," etc. The second would refer to "all his Epistles," and would mean that there are certain difficulties in St. Paul's Epistles generally. St. Peter does not tell us what difficulties were in his thoughts - whether St. Paul's teaching about "the man of sin," and "the day of the Lord," or his doctrine of justification by faith, and his assertion of Christian liberty, which might be perverted into anti-nomianism by such men as the false teachers censured in chapter 2. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "hard to be understood," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the ignorant and unsteadfast.</span> Both words are peculiar to this Epistle; the last occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>, the first here only in the New Testament. The verb also translated "wrest" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is found only here; it means "to twist with a windlass," and so "to strain, to torture, to distort." <span class="cmt_word">As they do also the other Scriptures.</span> This passage is of the greatest interest, as showing that some of St. Paul's Epistles had by this time taken their place in the estimate of Christians by the side of the sacred books of the Old Testament, and were regarded as Holy Scripture. By "the other Scriptures" St. Peter means the Old Testament, and also, perhaps, some of the earlier writings of the New, as the first three Gospels and the Epistle of St. James. St. Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, quotes a passage which seems to come from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a> as Scripture (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto their own destruction;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their own destruction of themselves.</span> The use of both adjective and pronoun intensifies the meaning (comp. chapter 2 Peter 2:1, 12). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:11-18 From the doctrine of Christ's second coming, we are exhorted to purity and godliness. This is the effect of real knowledge. Very exact and universal holiness is enjoined, not resting in any low measure or degree. True Christians look for new heavens and a new earth; freed from the vanity to which things present are subject, and the sin they are polluted with. Those only who are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, shall be admitted to dwell in this holy place. He is faithful, who has promised. Those, whose sins are pardoned, and their peace made with God, are the only safe and happy people; therefore follow after peace, and that with all men; follow after holiness as well as peace. Never expect to be found at that day of God in peace, if you are lazy and idle in this your day, in which we must finish the work given us to do. Only the diligent Christian will be the happy Christian in the day of the Lord. Our Lord will suddenly come to us, or shortly call us to him; and shall he find us idle? Learn to make a right use of the patience of our Lord, who as yet delays his coming. Proud, carnal, and corrupt men, seek to wrest some things into a seeming agreement with their wicked doctrines. But this is no reason why St. Paul's epistles, or any other part of the Scriptures, should be laid aside; for men, left to themselves, pervert every gift of God. Then let us seek to have our minds prepared for receiving things hard to be understood, by putting in practice things which are more easy to be understood. But there must be self-denial and suspicion of ourselves, and submission to the authority of Christ Jesus, before we can heartily receive all the truths of the gospel, therefore we are in great danger of rejecting the truth. And whatever opinions and thoughts of men are not according to the law of God, and warranted by it, the believer disclaims and abhors. Those who are led away by error, fall from their own stedfastness. And that we may avoid being led away, we must seek to grow in all grace, in faith, and virtue, and knowledge. Labour to know Christ more clearly, and more fully; to know him so as to be more like him, and to love him better. This is the knowledge of Christ, which the apostle Paul reached after, and desired to attain; and those who taste this effect of the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, will, upon receiving such grace from him, give thanks and praise him, and join in ascribing glory to him now, in the full assurance of doing the same hereafter, for ever.</body></html>
