(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm" title="My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say to me, Where is your God?">Psalm 42:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-10.htm" title="Why should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of your servants which is shed.">Psalm 79:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-15.htm" title="Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.">Jeremiah 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm" title="You have wearied the LORD with your words.

Four answers have been given to this question: (1) The ancestors of the human race; (2) the patriarchs and prophets; (3) the first generation of Christians; (4) each generation of men in relation to those following. Probably nothing more definite than our remote ancestors is intended. The expression "fell asleep" is used of St. Stephen's death in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.">Acts 7:60</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-52.htm" title="And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,">Matthew 27:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-39.htm" title="The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.">1Corinthians 7:39</a>, where the word is not literally translated; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1Corinthians 15:18</a>, &c). The thoroughly Christian term "cemetery" (=sleeping-place), in the sense of a place of repose for the <span class= "ital">dead, </span>comes from the same Greek root.<p>There is a passage quoted by Clement of Rome (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> A.D. 100) which seems at first sight to contain a reference to this verse: "Far be from us this Scripture where He saith, Wretched are the double-minded, who doubt in heart and say, <span class= "ital">These things we heard in the times of our fathers also, but behold, we have grown old, and none of them has happened to us</span>" (<span class= "ital">Epistle to the Corinthians, </span>xxiii.). But the remainder of this "Scripture," as quoted by Clement, is so utterly unlike the verse before us, that one suspects some other source. And this suspicion is confirmed when we find the same passage quoted in the so-called <span class= "ital">Second Epistle of Clement</span> (xi.) as "the prophetic word." (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a> and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-9.htm" title="The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:">2Peter 2:9</a>). The differences between the two quotations are such that the pseudo-Clement appears to be quoting independently, and not merely borrowing from the true Clement. In neither case does close inspection encourage us to believe that our present verse is the source of the quotation. But the quotation by the true Clement is important as a complete refutation of the objection that "the fathers" means the first Christians, and consequently no such scoffing argument as this would be possible in the lifetime of St. Peter This very argument was not only in existence, but was condemned in a document which Clement before the close of the first century could quote as "Scripture." Comp. <span class= "ital">Epistle of Poly carp, </span>chap. vii.: "Whosoever perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts, and says there is neither resurrection nor judgment, he is the firstborn of Satan."<p><span class= "bld">All things continue as they were.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">as they are.</span> The error has probably arisen from a desire to get rid of the slight difficulty of <span class= "ital">two</span> dates being given: (1) from the death of "the fathers," and (2) from the beginning of the creation. The suggestion that "the fathers" are the first progenitors of the human race is another attempt to get rid of the difficulty by making the two dates virtually one and the same. But the second date is an after-thought, frequent in Thucydides, intensifying and strengthening the first. <span class= "ital">Since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they are</span>--nay, more, <span class= "ital">since the beginning of the creation.</span><p>This sceptical argument is used with increased force as each generation passes away. It will be at its strongest just before the fallacy of it is irrefragably exposed--on the eve of the day of judgment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>, "Where is the God of judgment?"). The Lord had prophesied of his coming; St. Paul had spoken more than once as if that coming were very near at hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). Yet he came not. Already men were beginning to mock, and to question whether the long-delayed promise would ever be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">For since the fathers fell asleep;</span> better, <span class="accented">from the day that.</span> By "the fathers" must be meant here the fathers of the Christian Church. St. Peter was writing more than thirty years after the Ascension. The first generation of Christians was rapidly passing away. Stephen "fell asleep" first, then James the son of Zebedee, the other James the Lord's brother, and many others who had looked, it may be, to see the coming of the Lord among those "which are alive and remain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>). But they had died, and he came not; and from the day of their death things went on as they were. Should men look for him still, the mockers asked, when the fathers looked in vain? The mockers adopted, in mockery, doubtless, the Christian phrase for death. The Lord first had said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ;" then the holy Stephen "fell asleep;" and so "they which are asleep" became the recognized name for the dead in Christ. Death is like sleep; the holy dead rest from their labours. They "sleep not idly," for they are at home with the Lord, and they are blessed; but yet the quiet rest of Paradise, though "far better" than this earthly life, is sleep compared with the perfect consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, which the redeemed of the Lord shall enjoy at last in his eternal glory. <span class="cmt_word">All things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation;</span> literally, <span class="accented">all things continue thus</span>, as they are, and as they have been from the beginning. There has been no sudden catastrophe; the world has gone on as it was; the laws of nature are still working with their changeless uniformity" (see a remarkable parallel in Clement, I, 23, which is important also as an independent proof that this argument of the scoffers is as old as the end of the first century). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 The purified minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may be active and lively in the work of holiness. There will be scoffers in the last days, under the gospel, men who make light of sin, and mock at salvation by Jesus Christ. One very principal article of our faith refers to what only has a promise to rest upon, and scoffers will attack it till our Lord is come. They will not believe that he will come. Because they see no changes, therefore they fear not God, Ps 55:19. What he never has done, they fancy he never can do, or never will do.</body></html>
