Wiclif and Rheims have "in." Simon Magus offering St. Peter money, which no doubt he was accustomed to take himself for his teaching, may illustrate this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-18.htm" title="And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,">Acts 8:18</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-5.htm" title="Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself.">1Timothy 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/1-10.htm" title="For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:">Titus 1:10-11</a>). These false teachers, like the Greek Sophists, taught for money. A bombastic mysticism, promising to reveal secrets about the unseen world and the future, was a very lucrative profession in the last days of Paganism, and it passed over to Christianity as an element in various heresies. (Comp. the <span class= "ital">Shepherd</span> of Hermas, <span class= "ital">Sim.</span> IX. xix. 3.)<p><span class= "bld">Make merchandise of you.</span>--The verb means literally <span class= "ital">to travel, </span>especially as a merchant on business; and hence "to be a merchant," "to trade," and, with an accusative, "to deal in," "make merchandise of." (Comp. our commercial phrase, "to <span class= "ital">travel</span> in" such and such goods.) It may also mean simply "to gain," or "gain over," which would make good sense here; but our version is perhaps better. The word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-13.htm" title="Go to now, you that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:">James 4:13</a>. "With feigned words" possibly refers back to "cunningly devised fables" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Lingereth not</span>.--Literally, <span class= "ital">is not idle, </span>the cognate verb of the adjective in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:8</a>. Their sentence has long since been pronounced, is working, and in due time will strike them. We have a similar thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1Peter 4:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Their damnation slumbereth not.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">their destruction.</span> (See fourth Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>.) Wiclif and Rheims have "perdition." The destruction involved in the judgment pronounced by God is awake and on its way to overtake them. The word for "slumbereth" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-5.htm" title="While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.">Matthew 25:5</a> only.<p>We now pass on to see how it is that this judgment "<span class= "ital">of a long time"</span> has been working. It was pronounced against all sinners, such as they are, from the first beginning of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in covetousness.</span> Covetousness was their besetting sin, the sphere in which they lived. St. Paul warned Titus against false teachers who taught "things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a>). Simon Magus, the first heresiarch, sought to trade in holy things; the like sin seems to have been characteristic of the false teachers of apostolic times. The word translated "feigned" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; the words of these men were not the expression of their real thoughts and feelings; they were invented, craftily contrived to deceive men, and that for the sake of money. The last words of the clause will admit another sense: "shall gain you," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "shall gain you over to their party;" and this view derives some support from the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>. But the verb is often used in classical writers in the sense of making a profit out of people or things, and this meaning seems most suitable here. The false teachers will work hard, as the Pharisees did, to make proselytes; but their real motive <span class="accented">is</span>, not the salvation of souls, but their own selfish gain. <span class="cmt_word">Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for whom the sentence of a long time idleth not.</span> The sentence of judgment is for them, for their condemnation; in the foreknowledge of God it has been pronounced long ago, and ever since it has been drawing near; it doth not tarry (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). The word rendered "of a long time" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) occurs only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And their damnation slumbereth not;</span> <span class="accented">destruction:</span> it is the word which has been used already twice in verse 1. The verb means literally "to nod," then "to slumber;" it is found elsewhere in the New Testament only in the parable of the virgins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-5.htm">Matthew 25:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Though the way of error is a hurtful way, many are always ready to walk therein. Let us take care we give no occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the holy name whereby we are called, or to speak evil of the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. These seducers used feigned words, they deceived the hearts of their followers. Such are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides upon them. God's usual method of proceeding is shown by examples. Angels were cast down from all their glory and dignity, for their disobedience. If creatures sin, even in heaven, they must suffer in hell. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin. See how God dealt with the old world. The number of offenders no more procures favour, than their quality. If the sin be universal, the punishment shall likewise extend to all. If in a fruitful soil the people abound in sin, God can at once turn a fruitful land into barrenness, and a well-watered country into ashes. No plans or politics can keep off judgments from a sinful people. He who keeps fire and water from hurting his people, Isa 43:2, can make either destroy his enemies; they are never safe. When God sends destruction on the ungodly, he commands deliverance for the righteous. In bad company we cannot but get either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others be troubles to us. Yet it is possible for the children of the Lord, living among the most profane, to retain their integrity; there being more power in the grace of Christ, and his dwelling in them, than in the temptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, with all their terrors or allurements. In our intentions and inclinations to commit sin, we meet with strange hinderances, if we mark them When we intend mischief, God sends many stops to hinder us, as if to say, Take heed what you do. His wisdom and power will surely effect the purposes of his love, and the engagements of his truth; while wicked men often escape suffering here, because they are kept to the day of judgment, to be punished with the devil and his angels.</body></html>
