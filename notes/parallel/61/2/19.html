The doctrines of Simon Magus, as reported by Irenaeus (I., chap. xxiii. 3) and by Hippolytus (<span class= "ital">Refut.</span> VI., chap. xiv.), show us the kind of liberty that such teachers promised--being "freed from righteousness" to become "the slaves of sin."<p><span class= "bld">Servants of corruption.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">bond-servants, </span>or <span class= "ital">slaves of corruption.</span> Our translators have often done well in translating the Greek word for "slave" by "servant" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>), but here the full force of the ignominious term should be given. Tyndale, Cranmer, and Geneva have "bond-servants;" Rheims "slaves." (Comp. "bondage of corruption," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Brought in bondage.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">enslaved.</span> We seem here to have an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.">John 8:34</a> (see Notes there): "Every one who continues to commit sin is the slave of sin," words which St. Peter may have heard. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?">Romans 6:16-20</a>, which the writer may also have had in his mind. There is nothing improbable in St. Peter being well acquainted with the Epistle to the Romans during the last years of his life; the improbability would rather be in supposing that he did not know it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While they promise them liberty;</span> literally, <span class="accented">promising.</span> The words cohere closely with the preceding clause. Liberty was the subject of their great swelling words of vanity; they talked loudly, made a great boast, about liberty. Perhaps they were wresting to their own destruction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15, 16</a>) the teaching of St. Paul concerning Christian liberty. St. Paul had spoken of the liberty of the glory of the children of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>); he had again and again asserted the liberty of Christians in things indifferent (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>, etc.). But he had insisted on the paramount duty of giving no offence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>, etc.), and had earnestly cautioned his converts to "use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh." There were false teachers who maintained that the true Gnostic was free from moral restraints, in fact, that liberty meant libertinism, liberty to sin (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>). They themselves are the servants of corruption. The construction is still participial, "being" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) being from the beginning servants of corruption. Those who talked about liberty were themselves all the time the bondservants, the slaves, of corruption. The word rendered "corruption" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) <span class="accented">in</span>cludes the sense of" destruction," as in verse 12 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</span> "Of whom," or "by whatever;" by Satan, the personal tempter, or by sin, the innate tendency; the Greek word will bear either meaning. Some good manuscripts add "also," which strengthens the assertion; "is he also brought in bondage." St. Peter's teaching corresponds exactly with that of St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>. There is a very close parallel to this clause in the 'Clementine Recognitions' (5:12; quoted by Dr. Salmon, in his 'Historical Introduction to the Books of the New Testament'): "unusquisque illius fit servus cui se ipse subjecerit." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:17-22 The word of truth is the water of life, which refreshes the souls that receive it; but deceivers spread and promote error, and are set forth as empty, because there is no truth in them. As clouds hinder the light of the sun, so do these darken counsel by words wherein there is no truth. Seeing that these men increase darkness in this world, it is very just that the mist ofdarkness should be their portion in the next. In the midst of their talk of liberty, these men are the vilest slaves; their own lusts gain a complete victory over them, and they are actually in bondage. When men are entangled, they are easily overcome; therefore Christians should keep close to the word of God, and watch against all who seek to bewilder them. A state of apostacy is worse than a state of ignorance. To bring an evil report upon the good way of God, and a false charge against the way of truth, must expose to the heaviest condemnation. How dreadful is the state here described! Yet though such a case is deplorable, it is not utterly hopeless; the leper may be made clean, and even the dead may be raised. Is thy backsliding a grief to thee? Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.</body></html>
