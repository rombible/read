This verse, if it refers to the same incident as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>, seems at first sight to tell somewhat in favour of the priority of Jude; for then, only when compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>, does it become intelligible. The inference is that this is an abbreviation of Jude, rather than Jude an amplification of this. But (1) such an inference is at best only probable. The writer of this Epistle might possibly count on his readers at once understanding his allusion to a tradition that may have been well known, while St. Jude thought it best to point out the allusion more plainly. (2) It is possible that the contest alluded to is not that between Satan and Michael about the body of Moses, but that between Satan and the angel of the Lord about Joshua the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>). (3) It is also possible that it does not refer to any contest with Satan at all, but merely to angels not denouncing these false teachers before God, but leaving them to His judgment. If either (2) or (3) is correct, the argument for the priority of Jude falls to the ground. If (1) is right, then the argument really favours the priority of 2 Peter; for if the author of 2 Peter had Jude before him (and this is maintained by those who contend for the priority of Jude), and wished to make use of St. Jude's illustration, why should he so deface St. Jude's statement of it as to make it almost unintelligible? The reason suggested is altogether inadequate--that reverential feelings made him wish to avoid mentioning Michael's name--a name that every Jew was perfectly familiar with in the Book of Daniel.<p><span class= "bld">Greater in power and might.</span>--This is taken in two ways--either "greater than these audacious, self-willed men," which is the simpler and more natural explanation; or "greater than other angels," as if it were a periphrasis for "archangels," which is rather awkward language. But either explanation makes good sense.<p><span class= "bld">Railing accusation against them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a railing judgment.</span> Wiclif has "doom," all the rest "judgment" both superior to "accusation." "Against them," if the reference is either to the contest about the body of Moses or to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>, must mean against "dignities," and "dignities" must here mean <span class= "ital">fallen</span> angels, who are considered still to be worthy of reverence on account of their original glory and indefectible spiritual nature. The position is, therefore, that what angels do not venture to say of devils, this, and worse than this, these audacious men dare to say of angels and other unseen powers. But "against them" may possibly mean "against the false teachers," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>they speak evil of angels, yet the angels bring no denunciation against them, but leave all judgment to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/32-35.htm" title="To me belongs vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.">Deuteronomy 32:35-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.">Hebrews 10:30</a>). This explanation avoids the awkwardness of making "dignities" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-10.htm" title="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2Peter 2:10</a> mean unseen powers generally, and chiefly <span class= "ital">good</span> ones; while "against dignities" in this verse has to mean against <span class= "ital">evil</span> powers <span class= "ital">only.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord.</span> The conjunction is <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, literally, "where" - they speak evil of glories, "where," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "in which case." The literal rendering of the following words, "angels being greater," makes it probable that the comparison is with the false teachers of the previous verse rather than with the "glories." The false teachers rail at glories, where angels, though greater than they, bring not a railing judgment against those glories. It seems certain that the words "against them" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) must refer to the "glories," and cannot mean, according to the Vulgate, <span class="accented">adversum se.</span> Men rail at these glories; but the elect angels, when they are commissioned to proclaim or inflict the just judgment (for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is "judgment," not" accusation") of God upon the angels that sinned, the fallen glories, do not rail; they remember what those lost spirits once were, and speak solemnly and sorrowfully, not in coarse, violent language. The apostle may be alluding to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>, but the resemblance to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8, 9</a> is so dose that this last passage must have been in his thoughts, even if he is not directly referring to the dispute between Michael the archangel and the devil. Luther's interpretation (adopted by Fronmuller and others), that the <span class="accented">wicked</span> angels are not able to bear the judgment of God upon their blasphemy, cannot be extracted from the words. The Alexandrine Manuscript omits "before the Lord;" but these words are well supported. The angels of judgment remember that they are in the presence of God, and perform their solemn duty with godly fear. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up to their own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.</body></html>
