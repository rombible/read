Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm" title="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.">2Peter 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2Peter 3:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Are gone astray</span>.--The main verb of this long sentence. Here parallels with Jude begin again. In the historical incident of Balaam, as in that of Sodom and Gomorrha, our Epistle is more detailed than Jude (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm" title="And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:">2Peter 2:7</a>). The past tenses in this verse are quite in harmony with the view that this chapter is a genuine prediction. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm" title="Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?">Genesis 49:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-15.htm" title="And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.">Genesis 49:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/49-23.htm" title="The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:">Genesis 49:23-24</a>.) The future foretold with such confidence as to be spoken of as already past is a common form for prophecy to assume.<p><span class= "bld">Balaam the son of Bosor</span>.--Bosor seems to be a dialectical variation from Beor, arising out of peculiar Aramaic pronunciation--a slight indication that the writer was a Jew of Palestine. The resemblance between these false teachers and Balaam consisted in their running counter to God's will for their own profit, and in prostituting their office to an infamous purpose, which brought ruin on the community. He, like they, had "enticed unstable souls," and had "a heart exercised in covetousness." A comparison of this passage with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14-15</a>, gives countenance to the view that among the false teachers thus stigmatised the Nicolaitans may be included. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-11.htm" title="Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.">Jude 1:11</a>, these ungodly men are compared not only to Balaam, but also to Cain and Korah. It seems more likely that St. Jude should add these two very opprobrious comparisons than that the vehement writer of this Epistle should reject material so suitable to his invective. If so, we have here another argument for the priority of our Epistle. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2Peter 2:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray;</span> literally, <span class="accented">forsaking</span> (or <span class="accented">having forsaken</span>; there are two slightly differing readings, both well supported) <span class="accented">the right way, they went astray.</span> The false teachers in St. Peter's time were like Elymas the sorcerer, whom St. Paul accused of perverting "the right ways of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10</a>; comp. also verse 2 of this chapter). In the 'Shepherd of Hermas' occurs what may be an echo of this verse: "Who... have forsaken their true way" (Vis., 3:7. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor.</span> The word rendered <span class="accented">"following"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is found also in chapter 2 Peter 1:16 and 2 Peter 2:2 of this Epistle, but nowhere else in the New Testament; it means "to follow out to the end." Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-32.htm">Numbers 22:32</a>, where the angel of the Lord says of Balaam, "Thy way is perverse before me." The form "Bosor," instead of "Beor," arose probably from a peculiar (perhaps Galilaean) pronunciation of the guttural <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>. Thus we, perhaps, have here an undesigned coincidence, a slight confirmation of St. Peter's authorship: he was a Galilaean, and his speech betrayed him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>); one characteristic of the Galilaean dialect was a mispronunciation of the gutturals. But some commentators see in the resemblance of the form "Bosor" to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, flesh, an allusion to those sins of the flesh into which Balaam allured the Israelites. Compare the Jewish use of such names as <span class="accented">Ishbosheth</span> in derision for <span class="accented">Eshbaal</span> ("the man of shame" for "the man of Baal"), and <span class="accented">Jerubbesheth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>) for <span class="accented">Jerubbaal.</span> The references to Balaam here, in St. Jude, the Book of the Revelation, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>, show that his history had made a great impression on the mind of thoughtful Christians. St. John connects his name with the Nicolaitanes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-15.htm">Revelation 2:15</a>, much as St. Peter here connects it with the false teachers of his time. Some, again, see in the etymology of the word "Nicolaitane" an allusion to that of "Balaam," as if the Nicolaitanes were followers of Balaam. There is another explanation in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the word "Bosor" is an Aramaic form, and that "the form possibly became familiar to St. Peter during his residence at Babylon, and suggests the probability that Aramaic traditions were still current respecting Balaam at the Christian era, and on the banks of the Euphrates" (additional note on Numbers 22:5). But the two oldest manuscripts read "Beer" here. Who loved the wages of unrighteousness (comp. verse 13, and also St. Peter's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18</a>). Balaam is not definitely accused of covetousness in the Old Testament narrative; but his conduct can be explained by no other motive. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up to their own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.</body></html>
