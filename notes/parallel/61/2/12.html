This verse appears to tell strongly in favour of the priority of our Epistle. The literary form of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>, is so very superior; the antithesis (quite wanting here) between abusing what they cannot know and misusing what they cannot help knowing is so telling, and would be so easily remembered, that it is improbable that a writer who was willing to adopt so much would not have adopted in this respect also; and whichever writer is second, it is evident that he was willing to adopt his predecessor's material almost to any extent. On the other hand, there is nothing improbable in a writer who knew this verse improving upon it by writing <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>. The verses, similar as they are in much of their wording, are very different in their general drift. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>, is simply an epigrammatic description of these ungodly men; this verse is a denunciation of final ruin against them.<p><span class= "bld">Made to be taken and destroyed.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">born naturally for capture and destruction. "</span>Natural" comes in better here as a kind of adverb than as an additional epithet to beasts. The force of it is that these animals cannot help themselves--it is their nature to rush after what will prove their ruin; but the false teachers voluntarily seek their own destruction against nature. This verse contains one of the repetitions noticed above (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm" title="And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:">2Peter 2:7</a>) as characteristic of this Epistle. The word for "destruction" and "corruption" is one and the same in the Greek, the destroying being literal in the first case, moral in the second. Moreover, the word for "perish" is from the same root. "Like brutes born for capture and <span class= "ital">destruction, </span>these men shall be <span class= "ital">destroyed</span> in their <span class= "ital">destruction.</span>" But such a translation would be misleading in English.<p><span class= "bld">Shall utterly perish.</span>--A reading of higher authority gives us, <span class= "ital">shall even perish.</span><p><span class= "bld">In their own corruption.</span>--"Own" may be omitted. Their present evil life anticipates and contains within itself the elements of their final destruction. Thus they "bring it upon themselves" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>). The right division of the sentences here cannot be decided with certainty; the Apostle hurries on, in the full flood of his denunciation, without paying much attention to the precise form of his language. On the whole, it seems best to place only a comma at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2Peter 2:12</a>, with a full stop or colon at "unrighteousness," and to make what follows part of the long sentence, of which the main verb is "are gone astray" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed.</span> The order of the words in the best manuscripts favours the translation of the Revised Version, <span class="accented">But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed.</span> The word rendered "mere animals" is literally "natural" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-10.htm">Jude 1:10</a>, "what they know naturally (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) as brute beasts." Speak evil of the things that they understand not; literally, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">railing in matters whereof they are ignorant.</span> (For the construction, see Wirier, 3:66. 5, at the end.) The context and the parallel passage in St. Jude show that the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the glories, are the things which the false teachers understand not and at which they rail. Good angels do not pronounce a railing judgment against angels that sinned. These men, knowing nothing of the angelic sphere of existence, rail at the elect and the fallen angels alike, lien should speak with awe of the sin of the angels; jesting on such subjects is unbecoming and dangerous. And shall utterly perish in their own corruption. The best manuscripts read here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> "shall also be destroyed in their own corruption." It seems better to take <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> in the sense of "corruption" here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>, and to suppose that St. Peter is intentionally playing on the double sense of the noun and its cognate verb than, with Huther, to refer the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "their own," to the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>, and to understand St. Peter as meaning that the false teachers, who act like irrational animals, shall be destroyed with the destruction of irrational animals. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up to their own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.</body></html>
