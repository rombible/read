Here there is nothing about going <span class= "ital">away</span> or <span class= "ital">astray, </span>nor about the flesh being "other" than is allowed. This is natural; Jude's remark applying to the inhabitants of the cities of the plain in particular, this to sensual persons generally.<p><span class= "bld">In the lust of uncleanness.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in the lust of pollution</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the lust that causes pollution. The exact word occurs nowhere else; the same word, all but the termination, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm" title="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.">2Peter 2:20</a>, and nowhere else.<p><span class= "bld">Despise government.</span>--(Comp. "despise dominion," <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm" title="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>.) Our version is minutely perverse. The word translated "government" here and "dominion" in Jude is one and the same in the Greek: whereas the words translated in both places "despise" are different.<p><span class= "bld">Presumptuous are they.</span>--A fresh verse should begin here; the construction is entirely changed, and a fresh start made. From "the unjust" to "government" the reference is to ungodly and sensual people in general; here we return to the false teachers in particular. <span class= "ital">Audacious</span> would be more literal than "presumptuous." The word is found here only. On the change to the present tense, see <span class= "ital">Introduction, </span>I., <span class= "ital">c, <span class= "greekheb"></span>.</span><p><span class= "bld">Speak evil of dignities.</span>--The exact meaning of "dignities," or "glories," is not clear, either here or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm" title="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>. The context in both places seems to show that spiritual powers alone are intended, and that earthly powers, whether civil or ecclesiastical, are not included, much less exclusively indicated. The construction here resembles that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a> : "Do not tremble in (or, <span class= "ital">while</span>) speaking evil of dignities," like "ye do well in taking heed." These men deny the existence of, or irreverently speak slightingly of, those spiritual agencies by means of which God conducts the government of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the lust of pollution.</span> The word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but the corresponding verb is found in several places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a>). We observe that in this verse St. Peter passes from the future tense to the present. And despise government; rather, <span class="accented">lordship</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). St. Jude has the same word in verse 8. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> it is used of angelic dignities. Here it seems to stand for all forms of authority. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities; literally, <span class="accented">daring, self-willed, they tremble not when speaking evil of glories</span>; or, <span class="accented">they fear not glories, blaspheming.</span> The word rendered "daring" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. These daring, self-willed men despise all lordship, all glories, whether the glory of Christ ("the excellent glory," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>), or the glory of the angels, or the glory of holiness, or the glory of earthly sovereignty. The next verse, however, makes it probable that the glory of the angels was the thought present to St. Peter's mind. It may be that, as some false teachers had inculcated the worship of angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>), others had gone to the opposite extreme (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a>). The Vulgate strangely translates <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> by <span class="accented">sectas.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up to their own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.</body></html>
