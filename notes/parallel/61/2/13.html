(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1Peter 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1Peter 5:4</a>; see also <span class= "ital">Epistle of Barnabas, </span>iv. 12.)<p><span class= "bld">As they that count.</span>--We must begin a fresh sentence, and somewhat modify the translation. "To riot" is too strong; the word means "delicate fare, dainty living, luxury," and if the exact meaning be retained, this will necessitate a change of "in the day time." For though "rioting in the day time" makes good sense--revelry even among professed pleasure seekers being usually confined to the night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm" title="For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:7</a>)--"dainty fare in the day time" does not seem to have much point. The meaning is, perhaps, "for the day," without thought for the morrow, <span class= "ital">counting luxury for the moment a pleasure</span>--the doctrine of the Cyrenaics and the instinct of "brute beasts." In the <span class= "ital">Shepherd</span> of Hermas (<span class= "ital">Sim. VI.</span> iv. 4) there is a passage which may possibly be an echo of this: "The time of luxury and deceit is one hour, but the hours of torment have the power of thirty days; if, then, a man luxuriates for one day," &c. &c. (See below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm" title="For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.">2Peter 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2Peter 3:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Sporting themselves.</span>--The word is a compound of the one just translated "luxury"; hence <span class= "ital">luxuriating.</span> It is worth noting that the words for "spots and blemishes" exactly correspond to the words translated "without blemish and without spot" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>. (See below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-14.htm" title="Why, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.">2Peter 3:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">With their own deceivings</span>.--Better, <span class= "ital">in their deceits, </span>if this is the right reading. But both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>, the reading is uncertain, authorities being divided between <span class= "ital">agapai, </span>"love-feasts," and <span class= "ital">apatai, </span>"deceits." In Jude the balance on purely critical grounds is decidedly in favour of "love-feasts;" here (though much less decidedly) in favour of "deceits." In Jude the context confirms the reading "love-feasts;" here the context is neutral, or slightly inclines to "love-feasts," to which "while they feast with you" must in any case refer. But if "love-feasts" be right in Jude (and this is so probable that we may almost assume it), this in itself is strong support to the same reading here. Whichever writer is prior, so strange a change from "deceits" to "love-feasts" would hardly have been made deliberately; whereas, in copying mechanically, the interchange might easily be made, the words being so similar. The change from "spots" to "rocks," if such a change has been deliberately made by either writer (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>), would not be parallel to a change between "deceits" and "love-feasts." The one is a mere variation of the metaphor, the other an alteration of the meaning. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.">2Thessalonians 2:10</a> there is possibly an intentional play upon the similarity of these two words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness.</span> The two most ancient manuscripts read here, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. This reading is adopted by the Revised Version in the translation, "suffering wrong as the hire of wrongdoing." But the other reading is well supported, and gives a better sense, "receiving, as they shall, the reward of unrighteousness." Balaam loved the reward of unrighteousness in this world (verse 15); the false teachers shall receive its final reward in the world to come. Whichever reading is preferred, this clause is best taken with the preceding verse. As they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime; literally, <span class="accented">counting the revel in daytime a pleasure.</span> St. Peter has hitherto spoken of the insubordination and irreverence of the false teachers; he now goes on to condemn their sensuality. The words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> cannot, with some ancient interpreters, be taken as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, daily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>). Many commentators, as Huther and Alford, translate "delicate living for a day" - enjoyment which is temporal and short-lived. But when we compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>, "They that are drunken are drunken in the night," and St. Peter's own words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>, it seems more probable that the apostle means to describe these false teachers as worse than ordinary men of pleasure. They reserve the night for their feasting; these men spend the day in luxury. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> means "luxurious or delicate living" rather than "riot." Spots they are and blemishes. (For <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, spots, St. Jude has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, sunken rocks.) The word for <span class="accented">"blemishes"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. But comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, where the Lord Jesus is described as "a Lamb without blemish and without spot (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." The Church should be like her Lord, "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>); but these men are spots and blemishes on her beauty. <span class="cmt_word">Sporting themselves with their own deceivings;</span> literally, <span class="accented">reveling in their deceivings.</span> The word for "reveling" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, used just above. The manuscripts vary between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, deceivings, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, loves, love-feasts. The former reading seems the best-supported here, and the latter in the parallel passage of St. Jude (verse 12). It is possible that the paronomasia may be intentional (compare the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of St. Peter and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Jude). St. Peter will not use the honourable name for the banquets which these men disgrace by their excesses. He calls them <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> - deceits, not love-feasts. There is no love in the hearts of these men. Their love-feasts are hypocrisies, deceits; they try to deceive men, but they deceive not God. <span class="cmt_word">While they feast with you.</span> The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm">Jude 1:12</a>. The false teachers joined in the love-feasts, but made them the occasion of self-indulgence. Compare the similar conduct of the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20-22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up to their own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.</body></html>
