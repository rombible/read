The <span class= "ital">meaning</span> is, "There shall be false teachers among you, as there were false prophets among the Jews;" the <span class= "ital">form is, </span>"But (in contrast to the true prophets just mentioned) there were false prophets as well, even as," &c.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be false teachers among you</span>.--We must add "also."

The word for "false teachers" occurs here only. It is probably analogous to "false witnesses," and means those who teach what is false, rather than to "false Christs," in which case it would mean pretending to be teachers when they are not. "False prophets" has both meanings--sham prophets and prophesying lies. Justin Martyr, about A.D. 145 (<span class= "ital">Trypho, </span>lxxxii.), has "Just as there were false prophets contemporaneous with your holy prophets" (he is addressing a Jew), "so are there now many false teachers amongst us." Another possible reference to this Epistle in Justin is given below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8</a>. As they occur close together, they seem to render it probable that Justin knew our Epistle. "There shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in heresies of destruction," is quoted in a homily attributed, on doubtful authority, to Hippolytus. (See below, on chap. iii. 3.)<p><span class= "bld">Privily shall bring in.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm" title="For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.">Jude 1:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a>; and see Notes in both places.

Wiclif and Rheims have "sects of perdition." "Damnable heresies" comes from Geneva--altogether a change for the worse. The Greek word <span class= "ital">hairesis</span> is sometimes translated "sect" in our version (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm" title="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,">Acts 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm" title="For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:">Acts 24:5</a>), sometimes "heresy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm" title="But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:">Acts 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.">1Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>). Neither word gives quite the true meaning of the term in the New Testament, where it points rather to divisions than doctrines, and always to parties inside the Church, not to sects that have separated from it. The Greek word for "destruction" occurs six times in this short Epistle, according to the inferior texts used by our translators (in the best texts five times), and is rendered by them in no less than five different ways: "damnable" and "destruction" in this verse; "pernicious ways," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2Peter 2:2</a>; "damnation," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2Peter 2:3</a>; "perdition," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm" title="But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved to fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.">2Peter 3:7</a>; "destruction," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2Peter 3:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Even denying the Lord that bought them.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">denying even the Master that bought them.</span> (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm" title="For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.">Jude 1:4</a>.) The phrase is remarkable as coming from one who himself denied his Master. Would a forger have ventured to make St. Peter write thus?<p>This text is conclusive against Calvinistic doctrines of partial redemption; the Apostle declares that these impious false teachers were redeemed by Jesus Christ. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And bring upon themselves.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">bringing upon themselves.</span> The two participles, "denying" and "bringing," without any conjunction to connect them, are awkward, and show that the writer's strong feeling is already beginning to ruffle the smoothness of his language.<p><span class= "bld">Swift destruction</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, coming suddenly and unexpectedly, so as to preclude escape; not necessarily coming <span class= "ital">soon.</span> (See first Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-14.htm" title="Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.">2Peter 1:14</a>.) The reference, probably, is to Christ's sudden return to judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10</a>), scoffing at which was one of the ways in which they "denied their Master." By their lives they denied that He had "bought them." He had bought them for His service, and they served their own lusts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there were false prophets also among the people;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">but there arose false prophets also among the people.</span> The transition is simple and natural. Besides the true prophets mentioned in the last chapter, who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, there arose false prophets, men who wore "a rough garment to deceive" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>), and assumed without warrant the prophetic character. Such pretenders would commonly prophesy false things; but the word <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> seems principally to imply the absence of a Divine mission. By "the people" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is meant the people of Israel, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-11.htm">Romans 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-5.htm">Jude 1:5</a>, etc. It is plain from these words that St. Peter, at the end of the last chapter, was speaking of the prophets of the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies.</span> By the false teachers, again (the word <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is peculiar to St. Peter), may be meant men whose teaching was false, or men who falsely claimed the teacher's office. St. Peter describes them as such as (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) shall bring in damnable heresies. The verb (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is found only here in the New Testament; the adjective derived from it is used by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>, "false brethren unawares brought in." It means "to bring in by the side of," as if these false teachers brought in their errors by the side of the true doctrine; it implies also the secondary notion of secrecy. Compare St. Jude's use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, compounded with the same prepositions (verse 4); and notice the difference of tenses - St. Jude using the past where St. Peter looks forward to the future; but St. Peter passes to the present tense in verse 10, and maintains it for the rest of the chapter. We may, perhaps, infer that the false teaching referred to was already beginning to affect the Churches of Asia Minor; but the errors were not so much developed there, the' false teachers had not gained so much influence as it seems they had in the Churches which St. Jude had principally in his thoughts. The literal translation of the words rendered "damnable heresies" is "heresies of destruction," the last word being the same which occurs again at the end of the verse. These heresies destroy the soul; they bring ruin both to those who are led astray and to the false teachers themselves. The word for "heresy"(<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), meaning originally "choice," became the name for a party, sect, or school, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>, "the sect of the Sadducees;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>," the sect of the Pharisees;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a> (in the mouth of Tertullus). "the sect of the Nazarenes;" then, by a natural transition, it came to be used of the opinions held by a sect. The notion of self-will, deliberate separation, led to its being employed generally in a bad sense (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10</a>, "A man that is a heretic, (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>)")<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Even denying the Lord that bought them;</span> literally, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">denying even the Master that bought them.</span> The word for "Master" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) implies that the deniers stand to the Lord in the relation of slaves, bondservants. The Lord had bought them; they were not their own, but his, bought with a price, "not with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; see also the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>). These words plainly assert the universality of the Lord's redemption. He "tasted death for every man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>), even for those false teachers who denied him. The denial referred to may have been doctrinal or practical; most of the ancient forms of heresy involved some grave error as to the Person of Christ; and the germs of these errors appeared very early in the Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22, 23</a>), denying sometimes the Godhead of our Lord, sometimes the truth of his humanity. But St. Peter may mean the practical denial of Christ evinced in an ungodly and licentious life. The latter form of denial appears most prominent in this chapter; probably the apostle intended to warn his readers against both. It is touching to remember that he had himself denied the Lord, though indeed the price with which our souls were bought had not then been paid; but his denial was at once followed by a deep and true repentance. The Lord's loving look recalled him to himself; his bitter tears proved the sincerity of his contrition. <span class="cmt_word">And bring upon themselves swift destruction;</span> literally, <span class="accented">bringing.</span> The participial construction unites the two clauses closely; the latter expresses the consequence of the former: they bring heresies of destruction into the Church, and by so doing bring upon themselves swift destruction. The word for "swift" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is used by no other New Testament writer. There is an apparent allusion to this verso in Justin Martyr ('Cum Tryph.,' 82), and the first clause of it is quoted in a homily ascribed to Hippolytus of Portus. Notice St. Peter's habit of repetition, he repeats the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> three times in verses 1-3; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> three times in verses 7, 8; the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> three times in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12-14</a>, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Though the way of error is a hurtful way, many are always ready to walk therein. Let us take care we give no occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the holy name whereby we are called, or to speak evil of the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. These seducers used feigned words, they deceived the hearts of their followers. Such are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides upon them. God's usual method of proceeding is shown by examples. Angels were cast down from all their glory and dignity, for their disobedience. If creatures sin, even in heaven, they must suffer in hell. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin. See how God dealt with the old world. The number of offenders no more procures favour, than their quality. If the sin be universal, the punishment shall likewise extend to all. If in a fruitful soil the people abound in sin, God can at once turn a fruitful land into barrenness, and a well-watered country into ashes. No plans or politics can keep off judgments from a sinful people. He who keeps fire and water from hurting his people, Isa 43:2, can make either destroy his enemies; they are never safe. When God sends destruction on the ungodly, he commands deliverance for the righteous. In bad company we cannot but get either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others be troubles to us. Yet it is possible for the children of the Lord, living among the most profane, to retain their integrity; there being more power in the grace of Christ, and his dwelling in them, than in the temptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, with all their terrors or allurements. In our intentions and inclinations to commit sin, we meet with strange hinderances, if we mark them When we intend mischief, God sends many stops to hinder us, as if to say, Take heed what you do. His wisdom and power will surely effect the purposes of his love, and the engagements of his truth; while wicked men often escape suffering here, because they are kept to the day of judgment, to be punished with the devil and his angels.</body></html>
