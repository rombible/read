Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.">John 4:6</a>. These men are like dried-up watering-places in the desert, which entice and mock the thirsty traveller; perhaps leading him into danger also by drawing him from places where there is water. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm" title="For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-3.htm" title="And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.">Jeremiah 14:3</a>.) The parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12-13</a>, is much more full than the one before us, and is more like an amplification of this than this a condensation of that--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>would a simile so admirably suitable to false guides as "wandering stars" have been neglected by the writer of our Epistle? A Hebrew word which occurs only twice in the Old Testament is translated by the LXX. in the one place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-6.htm" title="But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.">Genesis 2:6</a>) by the word here used for "well," and in the other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-27.htm" title="For he makes small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof:">Job 36:27</a>) by the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>, for "cloud." Thus the same Hebrew might have produced "wells without water" here and "clouds without water" in Jude. This is one of the arguments used in favour of a Hebrew original of both these Epistles. Coincidences of this kind, which may easily be mere accidents of language, must be shown to be numerous before a solid argument can be based upon them. Moreover, we must remember that the writers in both cases were Jews, writing in Greek, while thinking probably in Hebrew, so that the same Hebrew thought might suggest a different Greek expression in the two cases. When we have deducted all that might easily be accounted for in this way, and also all that is perhaps purely accidental, from the not very numerous instances of a similar kind that have been collected, we shall not find much on which to build the hypothesis of these Epistles being translations from Hebrew originals. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction to Jude, </span>II.)<p><span class= "bld">Clouds that are carried with a tempest.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">mists driven by the storm-wind.</span> Wiclif has "myistis." The words for "clouds" and "carried about" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>, are quite different, so that our version creates a false impression of great similarity. The idea is not very different from that of the "wells without water." These mists promise refreshment to the thirsty soil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-6.htm" title="But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.">Genesis 2:6</a>), and are so flimsy that they are blown away before they do any good. So these false teachers deceived those who were thirsting for the knowledge and liberty promised them by raising hopes which they could not satisfy.<p><span class= "bld">To whom the mist of darkness.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for whom the gloom of darkness.</span> (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm" title="And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.">Jude 1:6</a>.) "For ever" is wanting in authority; the words have probably been inserted from the parallel passage in Jude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are wells without water.</span> St. Peter has spoken of the vices of the false teachers; he goes on to describe the unprofitableness of their teaching. They are like wells without water; they deceive men with a promise which they do not fulfill. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm">Jude 1:12</a> there is a slight difference - "clouds without water" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clouds that are carried with a tempest;</span> better, <span class="accented">mists driven by a tempest.</span> The best manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, mists, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, clouds; they are driven along by the tempest; they give no water to the thirsty land, but only bring darkness and obscurity. The Greek word for "tempest" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span>) is used by St. Mark and St. Luke in their account of the tempest on the Sea of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">To whom the mist of darkness is reserved for over;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the blackness of darkness.</span> The words are the same as those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-13.htm">Jude 1:13</a> (comp. verse 4 of this chapter; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>, where the same verb is used of the inheritance <span class="accented">reserved</span> in heaven for the saints). The words "for ever" are omitted in the Vatican and Sinaitic Manuscripts; it is possible that they may have been inserted from the parallel passage in St. Jude; but they are well supported here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:17-22 The word of truth is the water of life, which refreshes the souls that receive it; but deceivers spread and promote error, and are set forth as empty, because there is no truth in them. As clouds hinder the light of the sun, so do these darken counsel by words wherein there is no truth. Seeing that these men increase darkness in this world, it is very just that the mist ofdarkness should be their portion in the next. In the midst of their talk of liberty, these men are the vilest slaves; their own lusts gain a complete victory over them, and they are actually in bondage. When men are entangled, they are easily overcome; therefore Christians should keep close to the word of God, and watch against all who seek to bewilder them. A state of apostacy is worse than a state of ignorance. To bring an evil report upon the good way of God, and a false charge against the way of truth, must expose to the heaviest condemnation. How dreadful is the state here described! Yet though such a case is deplorable, it is not utterly hopeless; the leper may be made clean, and even the dead may be raised. Is thy backsliding a grief to thee? Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.</body></html>
