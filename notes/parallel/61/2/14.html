If "deceits" be the right reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>, this clause throws some light on it. In any case, the metaphor from fishing, twice in this Epistle and only once elsewhere, may point to a fisherman of Galilee. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-27.htm" title="Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go you to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first comes up; and when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a piece of money: that take, and give to them for me and you.">Matthew 17:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">With covetous practices</span>.--Better, <span class= "ital">in covetousness.</span> The word is singular, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2Peter 2:3</a>, according to all the best MSS. and versions.<p><span class= "bld">Cursed children</span>.--Rather, <span class= "ital">children of malediction.</span> So Rheims; Wiclif has "sones of cursynge." They are devoted to execration; malediction has adopted them as its own. (Comp. "son of perdition," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin;</span> literally, <span class="accented">of an adulteress.</span> Compare our Lord's words in the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>), which may have been in St. Peter's thoughts. For the second clause, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-1.htm">1 Peter 4:1</a>, "He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin." <span class="cmt_word">Beguiling unstable souls;</span> rather, enticing. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>, a bait, belongs to the art of the fowler or fisherman, and would naturally occur to St. Peter's mind. He uses it again in verse 18 of this chapter (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a>). The word for "unstable" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16</a>. It is a word of peculiar significance in the mouth of St. Peter, conscious, as he must have been, of his own want of stability in times past. He would remember also the charge once given to him, "When thou art converted, strengthen (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) thy brethren" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An heart they have exercised with covetous practices;</span> rather, <span class="accented">trained in covetousness</span>, according to the reading of the best manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. This is the third vice laid to the charge of the false teachers. They had practiced it so long that their very heart was trained in the habitual pursuit of gain by all unrighteous means. Cursed children; rather, <span class="accented">children of curse.</span> Like "the son of perdition," "children of wrath," "children of disobedience," "son of Belial," etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up to their own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.</body></html>
