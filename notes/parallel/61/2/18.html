Wiclif has "scapen a litil;" Rheims "escape a litle." The word translated "scarcely" occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; that translated here "clean," and elsewhere "indeed," or "certainly," is frequent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-32.htm" title="But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.">Mark 11:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-47.htm" title="Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.">Luke 23:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-34.htm" title="Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.">Luke 24:34</a>, &c. &c). Hence the change, an unfamiliar word being, by a slight alteration, turned into a familiar one. The two Greek words are much alike.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For when they speak great swelling words of vanity;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for speaking.</span> "Great swelling words" is expressed by one word in the Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, St. Jude has the same word in verse 16; it is used in the classical writers of great bulk of any kind, literal or figurative. The genitive is descriptive - the words are swelling, high-sounding; but they are only words, vain and meaningless; they have nothing but emptiness behind them. <span class="cmt_word">They allure through the lusts of the flesh,</span> through much wantonness; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they entice</span> (as in verse 14) <span class="accented">in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness.</span> The preposition "in" denotes the sphere in which these men live, their condition, habits of life. The dative <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, literally "by lasciviousnesses," that is, by acts of lasciviousness, is the dative of the instrument; it states the means by which they entice men. <span class="cmt_word">Those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.</span> The Authorized Version follows the T.R., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; but most of the best manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. This last reading gives a better sense, "Those who are just escaping." The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> may be understood of time, or, perhaps better, of measure - "escaping by a little, a little way." Those who were "clean escaped "would not be so easily enticed by the false teachers. These are only beginning to escape; they have heard the word with joy, but have no root in themselves; they put their hand to the plough, but they look back. They "that live in error" are the heathen; the unhappy men who are led astray by the false teachers are just escaping from the heathen and from their mode of life. It is possible to understand these last words as a coordinate clause, a further description of those who are just escaping. The false teachers entice "those who are just escaping, those who live in error." But the common rendering seems better. The verb translated "live" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) is a favourite word with St. Peter (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1, 2, 16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:17-22 The word of truth is the water of life, which refreshes the souls that receive it; but deceivers spread and promote error, and are set forth as empty, because there is no truth in them. As clouds hinder the light of the sun, so do these darken counsel by words wherein there is no truth. Seeing that these men increase darkness in this world, it is very just that the mist ofdarkness should be their portion in the next. In the midst of their talk of liberty, these men are the vilest slaves; their own lusts gain a complete victory over them, and they are actually in bondage. When men are entangled, they are easily overcome; therefore Christians should keep close to the word of God, and watch against all who seek to bewilder them. A state of apostacy is worse than a state of ignorance. To bring an evil report upon the good way of God, and a false charge against the way of truth, must expose to the heaviest condemnation. How dreadful is the state here described! Yet though such a case is deplorable, it is not utterly hopeless; the leper may be made clean, and even the dead may be raised. Is thy backsliding a grief to thee? Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.</body></html>
