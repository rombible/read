It has been objected that not the ass but the angel forbad Balaam from proceeding. But it was the ass which hindered the infatuation of Balaam from hurrying him to his own destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-33.htm" title="And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain you, and saved her alive.">Numbers 22:33</a>). The word for "madness" is probably chosen for the sake of alliteration with "prophet<span class= "ital">"--prophetou paraphronian.</span> It is a very rare formation, perhaps coined by the writer himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But was rebuked for his iniquity;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but had a rebuke for his own transgression.</span> The word for "rebuke" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) Occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The guilt of offering the wages of unrighteousness rested with Balak; Balaam's own transgression lay in his readiness to accept them - in his willingness to break the law of God by cursing, for filthy lucre's sake, those whom God had not cursed. The dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbade the madness of the prophet. The word for "ass" is literally "beast of burden" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>). "Dumb" is literally "without voice;" naturally without voice, it spake with the voice of man. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, rendered "forbade," is rather "checked," or "stayed." The word for "madness" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The ass checked the prophet's folly by her shrinking from the angel, and by the miracle that followed; the angel, while permitting Balaam to expose himself to the danger into which he had fallen by tempting the Lord, forbade any deviation from the word to be put into his mouth by God. Balaam obeyed in the letter; but afterwards the madness which had been checked for the moment led him into deadly sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). We observe that St. Peter assumes the truthfulness of the narrative in the Book of Numbers (see Mr. Clark's note in the 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up to their own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. They walk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase to greater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise those whom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour. Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promise themselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who are bold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine grace and mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of the restraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations to obey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.</body></html>
