These repetitions of the same word, of which there are several examples in this Epistle ("destruction" thrice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1-3</a>; various repetitions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10-12</a>; "look for" thrice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2Peter 3:12-14</a>, &c), and which have been stigmatised as showing poverty of language, are perfectly natural in St. Peter, and not like the laboured efforts of a writer endeavouring to personate him. A person writing under strong emotion does not stop to pick his words; he uses the same word over and over again if it expresses what he means and no other word at once occurs to him. This is still more likely to be the case when a person is writing in a foreign language. The fact that such repetitions are frequent in the Second Epistle, but not in the First, is not only fully explained by the circumstances, but, as being so entirely in harmony with them, may be regarded as a mark of genuineness. "Delivered righteous Lot." Here, as in the case of the Flood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2Peter 2:5</a>), the destruction of the guilty suggests the preservation of the innocent. Is it fanciful to think that these lights in a dark picture are characteristic of one who had himself "denied the Master who bought him," and yet had been preserved like Noah and rescued like Lot? This brighter side is wanting in Jude, so that in the strictly historical illustrations this Epistle is more full than the other (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>); it is where apocryphal books seem to be alluded to that St. Jude has more detail.<p><span class= "bld">The filthy conversation.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">behaviour in wantonness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2Peter 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2Peter 2:18</a>)--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>licentious mode of life. The word for "conversation," or "behaviour," is a favourite one with St. Peter--six times in the First Epistle, twice in this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-11.htm" title="Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness,">2Peter 3:11</a>); elsewhere in the New Testament only five times.<p><span class= "bld">Of the wicked.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of the lawless</span>--a word peculiar to this Epistle; we have it again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-17.htm" title="You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.">2Peter 3:17</a>. The word translated "abominable" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-3.htm" title="For the time past of our life may suffice us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, parties, and abominable idolatries:">1Peter 4:3</a> is closely allied to it.<p>The judgment on Sodom and Gomorrha forms a fitting complement to that of the Flood as an instance of God's vengeance, a judgment by fire being regarded as more awful than a judgment by flood, as is more distinctly shown in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-6.htm" title="Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:">2Peter 3:6-7</a>, where the total destruction of the world by fire is contrasted with the transformation of it wrought by the Flood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and delivered righteous Lot, who was being worn out</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-24.htm">Acts 7:24</a>, the only other place of the New Testament where the word occurs) <span class="accented">with the behaviour of the lawless in licentiousness.</span> The word translated "lawless" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is found only in one other place of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a>); but it is near akin to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("abominable") of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-3.htm">1 Peter 4:3</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Though the way of error is a hurtful way, many are always ready to walk therein. Let us take care we give no occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the holy name whereby we are called, or to speak evil of the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. These seducers used feigned words, they deceived the hearts of their followers. Such are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides upon them. God's usual method of proceeding is shown by examples. Angels were cast down from all their glory and dignity, for their disobedience. If creatures sin, even in heaven, they must suffer in hell. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin. See how God dealt with the old world. The number of offenders no more procures favour, than their quality. If the sin be universal, the punishment shall likewise extend to all. If in a fruitful soil the people abound in sin, God can at once turn a fruitful land into barrenness, and a well-watered country into ashes. No plans or politics can keep off judgments from a sinful people. He who keeps fire and water from hurting his people, Isa 43:2, can make either destroy his enemies; they are never safe. When God sends destruction on the ungodly, he commands deliverance for the righteous. In bad company we cannot but get either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others be troubles to us. Yet it is possible for the children of the Lord, living among the most profane, to retain their integrity; there being more power in the grace of Christ, and his dwelling in them, than in the temptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, with all their terrors or allurements. In our intentions and inclinations to commit sin, we meet with strange hinderances, if we mark them When we intend mischief, God sends many stops to hinder us, as if to say, Take heed what you do. His wisdom and power will surely effect the purposes of his love, and the engagements of his truth; while wicked men often escape suffering here, because they are kept to the day of judgment, to be punished with the devil and his angels.</body></html>
