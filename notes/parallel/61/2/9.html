But the construction is disjointed, owing to the eagerness of the writer, and the main clause does not fit on to the introductory clauses very smoothly. Even the main clause itself is interrupted by the insertion of "to deliver the godly out of temptations." What the writer <span class= "ital">specially</span> wishes to prove is that "the Lord knoweth how to reserve the ungodly unto the day of judgment under punishment," as is shown by the "for" connecting <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2Peter 2:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To be punished.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">being punished, </span>or <span class= "ital">under punishment.</span> They are already suffering punishment while waiting for their final doom. The error in our version is parallel to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm" title="Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.">Acts 2:47</a>, where "such as should be saved" stands instead of "those who were being saved." The participle is present, not future.<p>The same double moral--that God will save the righteous and punish the ungodly--is drawn from the same historical instance by Clement of Rome (<span class= "ital">Epistle to the Corinthians, </span>xi.): "For his hospitality and godliness Lot was saved from Sodom, when all the country round was judged by fire and brimstone; the Master having thus foreshown that He forsaketh not them who set their hope on Him, but appointeth unto punishment and torment them who swerve aside." <span class= "greekheb"></span> possible, but not a certain, reference to our Epistle. (See Note below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.</span> We have here the apodosis corresponding with the conditional sentence beginning at verse 4. The three examples cited by St. Peter show that the Lord knows (and with the Lord knowledge involves power) how to deliver the righteous and to punish the wicked. The Greek words for "godly" and "unjust" are both without the article. The word rendered "to be punished" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) is a present participle, not future, and is better rendered, as in the Revised Version, "under punishment." The wicked are already under punishment while awaiting the judgment; the Lord had taught this in the parable of Dives and Lazarus (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6, 7</a>, and verse 4 of this chapter). Aristotle makes a distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the first being "chastisement inflicted for the good of those chastised;" the second, "punishment inflicted on the incorrigible for the satisfaction of justice" (see 'Rhet.,' 1:10); but it is doubtful whether this distinction exists in the New Testament (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>). Therefore it seems dangerous to lay much stress on the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> here (comp. Clement, I, 11.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Though the way of error is a hurtful way, many are always ready to walk therein. Let us take care we give no occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the holy name whereby we are called, or to speak evil of the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. These seducers used feigned words, they deceived the hearts of their followers. Such are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides upon them. God's usual method of proceeding is shown by examples. Angels were cast down from all their glory and dignity, for their disobedience. If creatures sin, even in heaven, they must suffer in hell. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin. See how God dealt with the old world. The number of offenders no more procures favour, than their quality. If the sin be universal, the punishment shall likewise extend to all. If in a fruitful soil the people abound in sin, God can at once turn a fruitful land into barrenness, and a well-watered country into ashes. No plans or politics can keep off judgments from a sinful people. He who keeps fire and water from hurting his people, Isa 43:2, can make either destroy his enemies; they are never safe. When God sends destruction on the ungodly, he commands deliverance for the righteous. In bad company we cannot but get either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others be troubles to us. Yet it is possible for the children of the Lord, living among the most profane, to retain their integrity; there being more power in the grace of Christ, and his dwelling in them, than in the temptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, with all their terrors or allurements. In our intentions and inclinations to commit sin, we meet with strange hinderances, if we mark them When we intend mischief, God sends many stops to hinder us, as if to say, Take heed what you do. His wisdom and power will surely effect the purposes of his love, and the engagements of his truth; while wicked men often escape suffering here, because they are kept to the day of judgment, to be punished with the devil and his angels.</body></html>
