But "righteous is a relative term; and in this case we must look at Lot both in comparison with the defective morality of the age and also with the licentiousness of those with whom he is here contrasted. Moreover, in the midst of this corruption he preserves some of the brighter features of his purer nomad life, especially that "chivalrous hospitality" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/19-2.htm" title="And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and you shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, No; but we will abide in the street all night.">Genesis 19:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-8.htm" title="Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do you to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.">Genesis 19:8</a>) to which the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews seems to point as a model: "Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-2.htm" title="And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.">Genesis 13:2</a>). Add to this the fact of God's rescuing him and his family, especially in connexion with the declaration that ten "righteous" people would have saved the whole city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-32.htm" title="And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.">Genesis 18:32</a>), and his ready belief and obedience when told to leave all, and also the fact that Zoar was saved at his intercession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-21.htm" title="And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.">Genesis 19:21</a>), and we must then admit that the epithet "righteous" as applied to Lot is by no means without warrant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For that righteous man dwelling among them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for the righteous man.</span> It was through his own choice that he dwelt among the people of Sodom. The recollection of this grave mistake must have added bitterness to the daily distress caused by the sins of his neighbours (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-11.htm">Genesis 13:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds.</span> The words, "in seeing and hearing," are best connected with the verb that follows, not with "righteous" according to the Vulgate (though this would be the natural connection, if with the Vatican Manuscript we omit the article), nor with "dwelling among them." The literal translation is, "was tormenting his righteous soul." The sight of lawless deeds and the sound of wicked words were a daily grief to Lot. He distressed himself; he felt the guilt and danger of his neighbours, the dishonour done to God, and his own unhappy choice. St. Peter cannot mean (as OEcumenius and Theophylact suppose) that Lot's affliction was caused by the sustained effort to resist the temptation of falling into the like vices himself. The Greek words for "seeing" and "dwelling among" occur only here in the New Testament. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Though the way of error is a hurtful way, many are always ready to walk therein. Let us take care we give no occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the holy name whereby we are called, or to speak evil of the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. These seducers used feigned words, they deceived the hearts of their followers. Such are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides upon them. God's usual method of proceeding is shown by examples. Angels were cast down from all their glory and dignity, for their disobedience. If creatures sin, even in heaven, they must suffer in hell. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin. See how God dealt with the old world. The number of offenders no more procures favour, than their quality. If the sin be universal, the punishment shall likewise extend to all. If in a fruitful soil the people abound in sin, God can at once turn a fruitful land into barrenness, and a well-watered country into ashes. No plans or politics can keep off judgments from a sinful people. He who keeps fire and water from hurting his people, Isa 43:2, can make either destroy his enemies; they are never safe. When God sends destruction on the ungodly, he commands deliverance for the righteous. In bad company we cannot but get either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others be troubles to us. Yet it is possible for the children of the Lord, living among the most profane, to retain their integrity; there being more power in the grace of Christ, and his dwelling in them, than in the temptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, with all their terrors or allurements. In our intentions and inclinations to commit sin, we meet with strange hinderances, if we mark them When we intend mischief, God sends many stops to hinder us, as if to say, Take heed what you do. His wisdom and power will surely effect the purposes of his love, and the engagements of his truth; while wicked men often escape suffering here, because they are kept to the day of judgment, to be punished with the devil and his angels.</body></html>
