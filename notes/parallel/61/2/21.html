To have loved a great truth, to have loved a high principle, and after all to lose them, is what often causes the shipwreck of a life. To have loved Jesus Christ and lost Him is to make shipwreck of eternal life.<p><span class= "bld">The way of righteousness.</span>--The life of the Christian. That which from a doctrinal point of view is "the way of truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2Peter 2:2</a>), from a moral point of view is "the way of righteousness." So also "the faith delivered to the saints" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm" title="Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you, and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.">Jude 1:3</a>, is the doctrinal equivalent of "the holy commandment delivered unto them" of this verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness;</span> better, as in the Revised <span class="accented">Version, for it were better.</span> (For this use of the imperfect indicative, see Winer, 3:41, 2, a.) The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to have known," here, and the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "after they have known," in the next clause, correspond with the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of the preceding, and, like that, imply that these unhappy men once had the full knowledge of Christ. (For "the way, of righteousness," compare "the way of truth" in verse 2, and note there.) <span class="cmt_word">Than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</span> The manuscripts exhibit some slight variations here: the Sinaitic and Alexandrine give "to turn back." By "the holy commandment" St. Peter means the whole moral Law, which the Lord enforced and widened in his sermon on the mount; from this the false teachers turned away. For the word "delivered" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>.

As clouds hinder the light of the sun, so do these darken counsel by words wherein there is no truth. Seeing that these men increase darkness in this world, it is very just that the mist ofdarkness should be their portion in the next. In the midst of their talk of liberty, these men are the vilest slaves; their own lusts gain a complete victory over them, and they are actually in bondage. When men are entangled, they are easily overcome; therefore Christians should keep close to the word of God, and watch against all who seek to bewilder them. A state of apostacy is worse than a state of ignorance. To bring an evil report upon the good way of God, and a false charge against the way of truth, must expose to the heaviest condemnation. How dreadful is the state here described! Yet though such a case is deplorable, it is not utterly hopeless; the leper may be made clean, and even the dead may be raised. Is thy backsliding a grief to thee? Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.</body></html>
