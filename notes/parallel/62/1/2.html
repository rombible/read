The main thought of verses 1 and 3 is, "We declare to you a Being both eternal and yet seen and known by us." That of verse 2 is, "This Being, in his character of the Life, became visible, and in him are centered all the relations between God and man." Quite in St. John's style, verse 2 takes up and develops a portion of verse 1, using its last word as the basis of a new departure (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> gives the same fact as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> from another point of view). <span class="cmt_word">Became flesh</span> is the fact in itself; the incarnation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. "Was manifested" is the fact in reference to mankind; their admission to the knowledge of it. The union of "see" with "bear witness" recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>; and here, again, verse 2 resumes and develops part of verse 1. <span class="cmt_word">Have seen</span> sums up the four verbs in verse 1; for in all languages sight is used of experience generally. <span class="cmt_word">Bear witness and declare</span> carries us a stage further - the communication of the experience. It is doubtful whether <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the object of all four verbs or of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> only. Note the double article: <span class="cmt_word">the life, the eternal life.</span> The Epistle begins and ends with this theme (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>).

The apostles had seen Him while they witnessed his wisdom and holiness, his miracles, and love and mercy, during some years, till they saw him crucified for sinners, and afterwards risen from the dead. They touched him, so as to have full proof of his resurrection. This Divine Person, the Word of life, the Word of God, appeared in human nature, that he might be the Author and Giver of eternal life to mankind, through the redemption of his blood, and the influence of his new-creating Spirit. The apostles declared what they had seen and heard, that believers might share their comforts and everlasting advantages. They had free access to God the Father. They had a happy experience of the truth in their souls, and showed its excellence in their lives. This communion of believers with the Father and the Son, is begun and kept up by the influences of the Holy Spirit. The benefits Christ bestows, are not like the scanty possessions of the world, causing jealousies in others; but the joy and happiness of communion with God is all-sufficient, so that any number may partake of it; and all who are warranted to say, that truly their fellowship is with the Father, will desire to lead others to partake of the same blessedness.</body></html>
