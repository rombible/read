Not the exact opposite, "if we confess <span class="accented">that we have sin</span>;" but "if we confess our sins." It is easy to say, "I am a sinner;" but if confession is to have value it must state the definite acts of sin. The context ("deceive <span class="accented">ourselves</span>... <span class="accented">he</span> is faithful") shows that confession at the bar of the conscience and of God is meant. Circumstances must decide whether confession to man is required also, and this St. John neither forbids nor enjoins. Note the asyndeton; there is no <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, as in verse 7. <span class="cmt_word">He is faithful and righteous,</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> must be rendered "righteous" rather than "just," to mark the contrast with unrighteousness <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, and the connexion with "Jesus Christ the <span class="accented">Righteous"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>). To forgive... to cleanse. As explained in verse 7, the one refers to freeing us from the penalties of sin, justification; the other to freeing us from its contamination, sanctification. The sense of <span class="accented">purpose</span> is not wholly to be surrendered. No doubt <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, like other particles, becomes weakened in later Greek; but even in later classical Greek the notion of purpose is mixed up with that of consequence. Much more is this the case in the New Testament, and especially in St. John, where what seems to us to be mere result is really design; and this higher aspect of the sequence of facts is indicated by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>. It is God's nature to be faithful and righteous; but it is also his <span class="accented">purpose</span> to exhibit these attributes towards us; and this purpose is expressed in <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 A message from the Lord Jesus, the Word of life, the eternal Word, we should all gladly receive. The great God should be represented to this dark world, as pure and perfect light. As this is the nature of God, his doctrines and precepts must be such. And as his perfect happiness cannot be separated from his perfect holiness, so our happiness will be in proportion to our being made holy. To walk in darkness, is to live and act against religion. God holds no heavenly fellowship or intercourse with unholy souls. There is no truth in their profession; their practice shows its folly and falsehood. The eternal Life, the eternal Son, put on flesh and blood, and died to wash us from our sins in his own blood, and procures for us the sacred influences by which sin is to be subdued more and more, till it is quite done away. While the necessity of a holy walk is insisted upon, as the effect and evidence of the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, the opposite error of self-righteous pride is guarded against with equal care. All who walk near to God, in holiness and righteousness, are sensible that their best days and duties are mixed with sin. God has given testimony to the sinfulness of the world, by providing a sufficient, effectual Sacrifice for sin, needed in all ages; and the sinfulness of believers themselves is shown, by requiring them continually to confess their sins, and to apply by faith to the blood of that Sacrifice. Let us plead guilty before God, be humble, and willing to know the worst of our case. Let us honestly confess all our sins in their full extent, relying wholly on his mercy and truth through the righteousness of Christ, for a free and full forgiveness, and our deliverance from the power and practice of sin.</body></html>
