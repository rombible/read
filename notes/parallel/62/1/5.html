The attention is aroused, as by the silence before the thunderstorm, to expect a central and fundamental notion of the utmost importance.<p><span class= "bld">That God is light.</span>--Here is the essence of Christian theology, the truth about the Deity as opposed to all the imperfect conceptions of Him which had embittered the minds of the wise. To the heathen, Deity had meant angry, malevolent beings, worshipped best by the secrecy of outrageous vice; to the Greeks and Romans, forces of nature transformed into superhuman men and women, powerful and impure; to the philosophers, an abstraction either moral or physical; to the Gnostics it was a remote idea, equal and contending forces of good and evil, recognisable only through less and less perfect deputies. All this John, summing up what the Old Testament and our Lord had said about the Almighty Father, sweeps away in one simple declaration of truth. Light was God's garment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm" title="Who cover yourself with light as with a garment: who stretch out the heavens like a curtain:">Psalm 104:2</a>; to Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a>), the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord was brightness; to Habakkuk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.">1John 3:3</a>), His brightness was as the light; Christ had called the sons of God children of the light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-36.htm" title="While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.">John 12:36</a>), and announced Himself as the Light of the World (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>); in the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>), Christ was the refracted ray of the Father's glory, "the express image of His person;" to James, the Almighty was the Father of all lights (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">James 1:17</a>); to Paul, He dwells "in the light that no man can approach unto" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1Timothy 6:16</a>); to St. Peter, the Christian state is an admission "into His marvellous light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a>). These ideas John comprehends: God is Light. Light physical, because (1) it was He who called everything first out of darkness, and (2) from whom proceeds all health and perfection; light intellectual, because (1) He is the source of all wisdom and knowledge, and (2) in His mind exist the ideals after which all things strive; light moral, because (1) His perfection shows that the difference between good and evil is not merely a question of degree, but fundamental and final, and (2) the life of Christ had exhibited that contrast sharply: once for all. Thus, on this declaration depends the whole doctrine of sin: sin is not merely imperfection; it is enmity to God. There can be no shades of progression, uniting good and evil: in Him is no darkness at all. Good and evil may be mixed in an individual: in themselves they are contrary.<p>(2) (6) <span class= "bld">If we say</span>.--A favourite form with John, expressing sympathetic delicacy.<p><span class= "bld">That we have fellowship with him. . . .</span>--Some of the Gnostics (like the Anabaptists) said that on account of their spiritual knowledge they were free to act as they liked, without committing sin. For walking as a description of the spiritual state, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-6.htm" title="And this is love, that we walk after his commandments.

At the same time, wherever such characteristics of Divine Light are found, there He is particularly present.<p><span class= "bld">We have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</span>--The antithesis to "lying and doing not the truth," presented under the twofold aspect of (1) the brotherly result of walking with God, (2) its purifying influence. Each human being that comes near us becomes the object of our friendly sympathy; and the sacrifice of Christ has both put away the sin of the world and prevents sin from reigning in our mortal bodies; it obtains forgiveness for us, and by reminding us that it was sin that brought Jesus to the cross, has a continually purifying power over us, through the Spirit of Christ and of the Father. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19-23</a>.)<p>(3) (8) <span class= "bld">If we say that we have no sin.</span>--The preceding words had reminded St. John that even mature Christians, though certainly not "walking in darkness," yet have sinful tendencies in themselves: sensuous impulses, non-spiritual inclinations, lack of self-knowledge, a lowered standard, principles and views borrowed partly from the world, wavering of will, and hence even graver faults. Not to admit this would be to mislead ourselves, and in us the power and energy of light, searching the very corners of the heart, would not be working. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-18.htm" title="For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.">Romans 7:18-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>.)<p>(9) <span class= "bld">If we confess our sins.</span>--An advance in the thought from the general "having sin." Confession to God must recognise and measure each particular fault. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-5.htm" title="I acknowledge my sin to you, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the LORD; and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-3.htm" title="For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.">Psalm 51:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-13.htm" title="He that covers his sins shall not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.">Proverbs 28:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-21.htm" title="And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight, and am no more worthy to be called your son.">Luke 15:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</span>--He, from the context, cannot possibly be any other than God. Here another grand progression of thought meets us: not merely "we are in the truth," but the actual and glorious result on God's side; faithful and just on account of Christ's sacrifice and our repentance. For the double notion of forgiving and cleansing, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1John 1:7</a>. The Romish interpreters, in their arbitrary way, limit the cleansing here to purgatory.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">If we say that we have not sinned.</span>--The argument of the passage equally excludes the interpretation "freedom from guilt since conversion" as "innocence during the whole life." St. John is here repeating, in a more emphatic form, the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1John 1:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">We make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</span>--Stronger far than "we lie," or "the truth is not in us." Our foolish presumption is regarded in its worst aspect: an impiety against God, whose word, revelation, appeal to our conscience, and witness by the Spirit, are thus blasphemously contradicted. Parallel to "we do not the truth" and "the truth is not in us," the practical result here is that we cannot be regarded as having in any sense received God's revelation into our hearts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5-<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>.</span> - 2.

The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-25.htm">1 John 2:25</a>, and frequent in the New Testament) must be rejected here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11</a> in favour of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament), on overwhelming evidence. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament means "promise," which would be almost meaningless here. The change from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (verses 2, 3) to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is noteworthy: the one is "declare," the other "announce." The message received from Christ, the apostle announces or <span class="accented">reports</span> (<span class="accented">renunciat</span>) to his readers. He does not <span class="accented">name</span> Christ <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; he is so full of the thought of Christ that he omits to name him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7, 9, 15</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is used of <span class="accented">authoritative</span> announcements; of priests and Levites in the LXX; of the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>); of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13, 14, 15</a>); of the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). St. John speaks with authority. <span class="cmt_word">God is light;</span> not <span class="accented">the</span> Light, nor a light, but light; that is his <span class="accented">nature.</span> This sums up the Divine essence on its intellectual side, as "God is love" on its moral side. In neither case has the predicate the article: <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. Light and love are not attributes of God, but himself. The connexion between this message and the introduction is not at first obvious. But St. John writes with his Gospel before him, and the prologue to that supplies the link. There, as here, three ideas follow in order: <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. There, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> immediately suggests its opposite, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. It is on the revelation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, and the consequent struggle between <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, that the Gospel is based. And this revelation is the highest: men alone are competent to receive or reject it. Other organisms exhibit the creative power as life: none but men can recognize it as light. And to know the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as light is to know the Father as light; for the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the Revelation of the Father's nature. That God is, in his very nature, light, is an announcement peculiar to St. John. Others tell us that he is the Father of lights (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>), the Possessor of light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), dwelling in light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); but not that he is light. To the heathen God is a God of darkness, an unknown Being; a Power to be blindly propitiated, not a Person to be known and loved. To the philosopher he is an abstraction, an idea, not directly cognizable by man. To the Jews he is a God who hideth himself; not light, but a consuming fire. To the Christian alone he is revealed as light, absolutely free from everything impure, material, obscure, and gloomy. Light was the first product of the Divine creative energy, the earnest and condition of order, beauty, life, growth, and joy. Of all phenomena it best represents the elements of all perfection. "This word 'light' is at once the simplest and the fullest and the deepest which can be used in human discourse. It is addressed to every man who has eyes and who has ever looked on the sun." It tells not only "of a Goodness and Truth without flaw; it tells of a Goodness and Truth that are always seeking to spread themselves, to send forth rays that shall penetrate everywhere, and scatter the darkness which opposes them" (Maurice). In like manner, darkness sums up the elements of evil - foulness, secrecy, repulsiveness, and gloom. In all but the lowest forms of existence it inevitably produces decay and death. Everything of the kind is excluded from the nature of God. And hence St. John, in his characteristic manner, immediately emphasizes the great announcement with an equivalent negative statement: <span class="cmt_word">Darkness in him there is not any at all</span> (comp. verse 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 23, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2, 3, 6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>). He does not say, "in his presence," but "in him." Darkness exists, physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual; there is abundance of obscurity, error, depravity, sin, and its consequence, death. But not a shade of these is "in him." The Divine Light is subject to no spots, no eclipse, no twilight, no night; as a Source of light it cannot in any degree fail. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 A message from the Lord Jesus, the Word of life, the eternal Word, we should all gladly receive. The great God should be represented to this dark world, as pure and perfect light. As this is the nature of God, his doctrines and precepts must be such. And as his perfect happiness cannot be separated from his perfect holiness, so our happiness will be in proportion to our being made holy. To walk in darkness, is to live and act against religion. God holds no heavenly fellowship or intercourse with unholy souls. There is no truth in their profession; their practice shows its folly and falsehood. The eternal Life, the eternal Son, put on flesh and blood, and died to wash us from our sins in his own blood, and procures for us the sacred influences by which sin is to be subdued more and more, till it is quite done away. While the necessity of a holy walk is insisted upon, as the effect and evidence of the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, the opposite error of self-righteous pride is guarded against with equal care. All who walk near to God, in holiness and righteousness, are sensible that their best days and duties are mixed with sin. God has given testimony to the sinfulness of the world, by providing a sufficient, effectual Sacrifice for sin, needed in all ages; and the sinfulness of believers themselves is shown, by requiring them continually to confess their sins, and to apply by faith to the blood of that Sacrifice. Let us plead guilty before God, be humble, and willing to know the worst of our case. Let us honestly confess all our sins in their full extent, relying wholly on his mercy and truth through the righteousness of Christ, for a free and full forgiveness, and our deliverance from the power and practice of sin.</body></html>
