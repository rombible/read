There it was calm contemplation of the height and depth of Christ's existence; here he vehemently insists on the personal relation between the Word and those to whom He had been revealed.<p>As in the Gospel, he starts with the grandeur of an indefiniteness beyond which no eye can pierce: At the beginning of all that concerns us, be it world or universe or all creation, there was----that which we are announcing. "That which," not "Him who," because it is not merely the Person of Christ which he is going to declare, but also His Being, all that relates to Him, His gospel, the treasures of wisdom that lay in Him, His truth, all that could be known about Him by human ken.<p>The vibrating eloquence of the passage makes the construction at first sight obscure. But take "that declare we unto you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1John 1:3</a>) as the principal verb, set aside <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1John 1:2</a> as a parenthesis, notice the rising climax of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a> (heard, seen, looked upon, handled), pause at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a> to sum up the results of this climax in the words "of (or, <span class= "ital">that which concerns</span>) the Word of life," and at the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1John 1:3</a> resume the thoughts interrupted by the parenthesis, and all is at once clear.<p><span class= "bld">Which we have heard.</span>--All those gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth, enough to fill countless books could they have been noted down. St. John has given us more of these than any other of the Evangelists; and their effect upon him was such that it is almost the same as if he had written down nothing at all of his own; for the thought and style of Him who had loved him more intimately than others, had moulded his own thought and style into a strikingly close resemblance. "We" includes ail the eye-witnesses. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-2.htm" title="Even as they delivered them to us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;">Luke 1:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Which we have seen.</span>--All that is meant by the Word of God in its fullest sense had been seen in the human Person of Jesus of Nazareth during His earthly sojourn, and especially during the three years' ministry. In a similar sense Jesus Himself said, "He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?">John 14:9</a>.

There is a change of tense implying emphasis on the historic fact, "which in those days we gazed upon."<p><span class= "bld">And our hands have handled.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-49.htm" title="And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.">Matthew 26:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm" title="Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.">Luke 24:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm" title="Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.">John 20:27</a>. This and the foregoing expressions might be directed against Cerinthus and the Doketists--those that held that Christ was only a phantom.<p><span class= "bld">Of the Word of life.</span>--<span class= "ital">All that concerns the Word of the true Life, </span>the Reason, or Son, or Express Image of God, in whom was inherent all life, material as well as moral or religious.

After the manner of St. John, the word "life" at the end of the last sentence suggests the form of the phrasing in the new sentence: Jesus was that <span class= "ital">Eternal Life</span> which was at the side of the Father, in communion with Him, in equal intercourse with Him; that Life on which all other existence, physical and spiritual, depend (1) for its license to exist, (2) for its fulfilment of the end for which it was created. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The first clause states what or how the object is in itself; the next three state St. John's relation to it; "which," in the first clause nominative, in the others is accusative. The neuter (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span>) expresses a collective and comprehensive whole (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, etc.); the attributes of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> rather than the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> himself are indicated. Or, as Jelf expresses it, "the neuter gender denotes immaterial personality, the masculine or feminine material personality." <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning</span> is not quite the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; there St. John tells us that the Word was in existence before the world was created; here that he was in existence before he was manifested. Thus far all is indefinite; the philosopher, about to expound a law of nature, might begin, "That which was from the beginning declare we unto you." What follows is in a climax, making the meaning clearer at each step: seeing is more than hearing, and handling than seeing. The climax is in two pairs, of perfects and of aorists; the aorists giving the past acts, the perfects the permanent results. Together they sum up the apostolic experience of that boundless activity of Christ, of which the world could not contain the full account (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beheld</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> is more than <span class="cmt_word">have seen</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Seeing might be momentary; beholding implies that steady contemplation, for which the beloved disciple had large and abundantly used opportunities. <span class="cmt_word">In our hands handled</span> we may see a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>, where the same verb is used <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; and still more to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>, where the demanded test of handling is offered to St. Thomas, provoking the confession of faith to which the whole Gospel leads up, "My Lord and my God!" Had St. John merely said "heard," we might have thought that he meant a doctrine. Had he merely said "heard and seen," we might have understood it of the effects of Christ's doctrine. But "our hands handled" shows clearly that <span class="accented">the attributes of the Word become flesh</span> are what St. John insists on, and probably as a contradiction of Docetism. "Those who read his letter could have no doubt that he was referring to the time when he saw the face of Jesus Christ, when he heard his discourses, when he grasped his hand, when he leaned upon his breast" (Maurice). Between the first clause and what follows lies the tremendous fact of the Incarnation; and St. John piles verb on verb, and clause on clause, to show that he speaks with the authority of full knowledge, and that there is no possible room for Ebionite or Cerinthian error. The first clause assures us that Jesus was no mere man; the others assure us that he was really man. Precisely that Being who was in existence from the beginning is that of whom St. John and others have had, and still possess, knowledge by all the means through which knowledge can have access to the mind of man. (For "seeing with the eyes," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30</a>; for <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of contemplating with delight [Stark 16:11, 14], <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Concerning the Word of life.</span> "Concerning" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> may depend on "have heard," and, by a kind of zengma, on the other three verbs also; or on the main verb," we declare." "The Word of life" means "the Word who is the Life," like "the city of Rome,... the Book of Genesis;" the genitive case is "the characterizing or identifying genitive." The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> is strongly against the interpretation, "the word of life," i.e., the life-giving gospel. Had St. John meant this, he would probably have written <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-43.htm">John 8:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-24.htm">John 14:24</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> is very frequent of persons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 8, 15, 22, 30, 48</a>, etc.). Moreover, the evident connexion between the introductions to his Gospel and Epistle compels us to understand <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the same sense in both (see on John 1:1 in this Commentary, and in the 'Cambridge Greek Testament' or 'Bible for Schools'). What St. John has to announce is his own experience of the Eternal Word incarnate, the Eternal Life made manifest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>); his hearing of his words, his seeing with his own eyes his Messianic works, his contemplation of the Divinity which shone through both; his handling of the body of the risen Redeemer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 That essential Good, that uncreated Excellence, which had been from the beginning, from eternity, as equal with the Father, and which at length appeared in human nature for the salvation of sinners, was the great subject concerning which the apostle wrote to his brethren. The apostles had seen Him while they witnessed his wisdom and holiness, his miracles, and love and mercy, during some years, till they saw him crucified for sinners, and afterwards risen from the dead. They touched him, so as to have full proof of his resurrection. This Divine Person, the Word of life, the Word of God, appeared in human nature, that he might be the Author and Giver of eternal life to mankind, through the redemption of his blood, and the influence of his new-creating Spirit. The apostles declared what they had seen and heard, that believers might share their comforts and everlasting advantages. They had free access to God the Father. They had a happy experience of the truth in their souls, and showed its excellence in their lives. This communion of believers with the Father and the Son, is begun and kept up by the influences of the Holy Spirit. The benefits Christ bestows, are not like the scanty possessions of the world, causing jealousies in others; but the joy and happiness of communion with God is all-sufficient, so that any number may partake of it; and all who are warranted to say, that truly their fellowship is with the Father, will desire to lead others to partake of the same blessedness.</body></html>
