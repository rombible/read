He again speaks conditionally <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, and does so until <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a>; after which the participial substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> represents the conditional clause. The change of verbs is significant: we <span class="accented">walk</span>, God <span class="accented">is</span>, in the light. We move through time; he is in eternity. Our activity involves change; his does not. Like the sun, he both is Light and dwells in the light; and <span class="cmt_word">if we walk in the light,</span> which is his atmosphere, <span class="cmt_word">we have fellowship one with another.</span> Darkness is an <span class="accented">unsocial</span> condition, and this the light expels. From verse 6 we might have expected, "we have fellowship with him;" and some inferior authorities read <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. But St. John's repetitions are not mere repetitions: the thought is always recur or reset to carry us a step further (cf. verses 3, 4). Having fellowship with one another is a sure result of that fellowship with God which is involved in walking in the light. "Here is a reply to those who would restrain Catholic communion to their own sect" (Wordsworth). Another result of walking in the light is that the blood of Jesus (his sacrificial death) cleanses us day by day continually (present tense) from our frequent sins of frailty. This cleansing is not the same as forgiveness of sins (verse 9). The latter is the case of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the man that is bathed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>); the former is the frequent washing of the feet (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-14.htm">Revelation 22:14</a>). The expression, <span class="cmt_word">the blood of Jesus,</span> in Christian theology, "is dogma with pathos.... It implies, as no other word could do, the reality <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the human body of Jesus, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of his sufferings, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of his sacrifice." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By his blood new life-blood is infused into human nature. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 A message from the Lord Jesus, the Word of life, the eternal Word, we should all gladly receive. The great God should be represented to this dark world, as pure and perfect light. As this is the nature of God, his doctrines and precepts must be such. And as his perfect happiness cannot be separated from his perfect holiness, so our happiness will be in proportion to our being made holy. To walk in darkness, is to live and act against religion. God holds no heavenly fellowship or intercourse with unholy souls. There is no truth in their profession; their practice shows its folly and falsehood. The eternal Life, the eternal Son, put on flesh and blood, and died to wash us from our sins in his own blood, and procures for us the sacred influences by which sin is to be subdued more and more, till it is quite done away. While the necessity of a holy walk is insisted upon, as the effect and evidence of the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, the opposite error of self-righteous pride is guarded against with equal care. All who walk near to God, in holiness and righteousness, are sensible that their best days and duties are mixed with sin. God has given testimony to the sinfulness of the world, by providing a sufficient, effectual Sacrifice for sin, needed in all ages; and the sinfulness of believers themselves is shown, by requiring them continually to confess their sins, and to apply by faith to the blood of that Sacrifice. Let us plead guilty before God, be humble, and willing to know the worst of our case. Let us honestly confess all our sins in their full extent, relying wholly on his mercy and truth through the righteousness of Christ, for a free and full forgiveness, and our deliverance from the power and practice of sin.</body></html>
