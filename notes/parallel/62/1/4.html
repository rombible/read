The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> seems preferable to <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> are not coordinate: <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is the apostolic "we;" <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> means "your joy as well as mine." This verse takes the place of the usual "grace and peace" in the opening of other Epistles; and as verse 3 recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>, so this recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-13.htm">John 17:13</a>. The joy is that of knowing that, though in the world, they are not of it, but are one with one another, and with the Father and with the Son. The gospel is always joy: "Rejoice alway" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>); "Rejoice in the Lord alway" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>). To know that the Eternal Life has been manifested, that we have communion with him, and through him with the Father, must be joy. Whereas Gnosticism, by denying the atonement, and "the personal office of God in the salvation of the world," cuts off one great sphere of God's love, and consequently one great cause of the believer's joy. To sum up this introduction: St. John gives his Gospel to the Church <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in order that all may share in the union for which Christ prayed; and to the Gospel he adds this Epistle <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, that all may realize the joy resulting from this union - <span class="cmt_word">that our joy may be fulfilled.</span> In this introduction we find the following expressions which are characteristic of St. John, serving to show the common authorship of the Gospel and Epistle, and in some cases of the Revelation also: <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. It is among the many excellences of the Revised Version that characteristic expressions are marked by a uniform translation; whereas in the Authorized Version they are obscured by capriciously varying the translation: <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is rendered in <span class="accented">four</span> different ways - "bear witness," "bear record," "give record," "testify" (cf. page 10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 That essential Good, that uncreated Excellence, which had been from the beginning, from eternity, as equal with the Father, and which at length appeared in human nature for the salvation of sinners, was the great subject concerning which the apostle wrote to his brethren. The apostles had seen Him while they witnessed his wisdom and holiness, his miracles, and love and mercy, during some years, till they saw him crucified for sinners, and afterwards risen from the dead. They touched him, so as to have full proof of his resurrection. This Divine Person, the Word of life, the Word of God, appeared in human nature, that he might be the Author and Giver of eternal life to mankind, through the redemption of his blood, and the influence of his new-creating Spirit. The apostles declared what they had seen and heard, that believers might share their comforts and everlasting advantages. They had free access to God the Father. They had a happy experience of the truth in their souls, and showed its excellence in their lives. This communion of believers with the Father and the Son, is begun and kept up by the influences of the Holy Spirit. The benefits Christ bestows, are not like the scanty possessions of the world, causing jealousies in others; but the joy and happiness of communion with God is all-sufficient, so that any number may partake of it; and all who are warranted to say, that truly their fellowship is with the Father, will desire to lead others to partake of the same blessedness.</body></html>
