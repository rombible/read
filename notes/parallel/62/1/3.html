Of course, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, must be rendered alike in both verses "we declare." To what does it refer? Not to this Epistle, which does not contain the writer's experience of the Word of life manifested to mankind, but to his Gospel, which the Epistle is to accompany. The parallel between the two writings must often be noted, especially between the Epistle and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17.htm">John 17</a>. Compare this verse with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>. St. John's aim in writing his Gospel is that the great High Priest's prayer may be fulfilled - that believers may be one in that communion of which the unity between the Father and the Son is the pattern and the basis; may "be joined together in the same body, the same belief, the same knowledge, the same sins, the same hopes, the same destinies" (Jelf). Communion with Christians is shown to mean a great deal - no less than communion with the Father and with the Son. Note the double <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> St. John's writings teem with indications of the unity and yet distinctness between the Father and the Son. Communion with the one, so far from absorbing and canceling communion with the other, implies it as a separate bliss. The clause <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>., does not depend on <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, as the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> shows; we must supply <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1fc7;</span>. (For <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>, where, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> is the leading conjunction; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-16.htm">John 8:16, 17</a> and John 15:27, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> leads.) <span class="accented">"Blessed</span> <span class="accented">are they that see not and yet believe.</span> It is <span class="accented">we</span> who are here described, <span class="accented">we</span> who are designated. Then let the blessedness take place in us, of which the Lord predicted that it should take place. Let us firmly hold that which we see not, because those tell us who have seen" (St. Augustine, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 That essential Good, that uncreated Excellence, which had been from the beginning, from eternity, as equal with the Father, and which at length appeared in human nature for the salvation of sinners, was the great subject concerning which the apostle wrote to his brethren. The apostles had seen Him while they witnessed his wisdom and holiness, his miracles, and love and mercy, during some years, till they saw him crucified for sinners, and afterwards risen from the dead. They touched him, so as to have full proof of his resurrection. This Divine Person, the Word of life, the Word of God, appeared in human nature, that he might be the Author and Giver of eternal life to mankind, through the redemption of his blood, and the influence of his new-creating Spirit. The apostles declared what they had seen and heard, that believers might share their comforts and everlasting advantages. They had free access to God the Father. They had a happy experience of the truth in their souls, and showed its excellence in their lives. This communion of believers with the Father and the Son, is begun and kept up by the influences of the Holy Spirit. The benefits Christ bestows, are not like the scanty possessions of the world, causing jealousies in others; but the joy and happiness of communion with God is all-sufficient, so that any number may partake of it; and all who are warranted to say, that truly their fellowship is with the Father, will desire to lead others to partake of the same blessedness.</body></html>
