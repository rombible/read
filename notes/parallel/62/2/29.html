The coming of Christ suggests the righteousness of Christ; for it is as the righteous Judge that he is coming, and those who would not be ashamed to meet him at his coming must be righteous also. Once more (verse 27) we are in doubt between indicative and imperative: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, in spite of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and following <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is probably indicative. To know that God (not Christ; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>) is righteous is to perceive that every doer of his <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> righteousness is a son of God (not of Christ; we are nowhere in Scripture said to be born of Christ). To partake of that righteousness which is God's nature is proof of birth from him. With <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, compare <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>). Righteousness must be shown in <span class="accented">conduct</span>; mere desire to be righteous will not suffice. And the conduct must be <span class="accented">habitual</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; a single act of righteousness will not suffice. Note the change from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. To know (intuitively) that God is righteous is to come to know (by experience) that whoever habitually acts righteously is God's offspring. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:24-29 The truth of Christ, abiding in us, is a means to sever from sin, and unites us to the Son of God, Joh 15:3,4. What value should we put upon gospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. The promise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. The apostle repeats the kind words, little children; which denotes his affection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige to gospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. The new spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born from above, from the Lord Christ.
