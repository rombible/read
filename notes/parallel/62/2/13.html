Apparently a primary word; a 'father'.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because ye know</span> (literally, <span class="accented">have come to know</span>, as in verses 3, 4) him that is from the beginning <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. The context respecting Christ's Name and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>) show that the Word and not the Father is meant. A more perfect knowledge of Jesus as the Eternal Word, and no mere aeon or emanation from the Deity, is the special prerogative of the aged Christian; and such are fit recipients of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the apostle. No less fit, but for a different reason, are the younger among his readers. To fight is the lot of the young soldier; and a victorious warfare against Satan is the distinction of youthful Christians. They have got the better of that evil one in whose power the whole world lies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>). Not that the warfare is over, but that it is henceforth warfare with a defeated enemy. Hence they also have a right to share in the apostolic message. I wrote (or, <span class="accented">have written</span>) to you, children, because ye know (or, <span class="accented">have come to know</span>) the Father. The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> must be preferred to <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span>, on overwhelming evidence, both external and internal. The second triplet begins here, and this sentence should have been given to verse 14. It is difficult to determine what is meant by the change from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs once with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (verse 1), and six times without <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the Epistle, and once in the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>), the probable source of this form of address. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs in verse 18 (see note) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-5.htm">John 21:5</a>, and nowhere else in the New Testament as a form of address. Probably both words are applied to the whole of St. John's readers. Some would limit <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to actual children; but in that case we should expect a different order - children, young men, fathers; or fathers, young men, children. These "children" know the Father to whom they have been reconciled by forgiveness of sins; they have become his <span class="accented">adopted</span> sons through the Name of his <span class="accented">own</span> Son (verse 12). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-14 As Christians have their peculiar states, so they have peculiar duties; but there are precepts and obedience common to all, particularly mutual love, and contempt of the world. The youngest sincere disciple is pardoned: the communion of saints is attended with the forgiveness of sins. Those of the longest standing in Christ's school need further advice and instruction. Even fathers must be written unto, and preached unto; none are too old to learn. But especially young men in Christ Jesus, though they are arrived at strength of spirit and sound sense, and have successfully resisted first trials and temptations, breaking off bad habits and connexions, and entered in at the strait gate of true conversion. The different descriptions of Christians are again addressed. Children in Christ know that God is their Father; it is wisdom. Those advanced believers, who know Him that was from the beginning, before this world was made, may well be led thereby to give up this world. It will be the glory of young persons to be strong in Christ, and his grace. By the word of God they overcome the wicked one.</body></html>
