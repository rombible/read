"What St. John would have us feel is this, that there can be no promise to compare with this - that we should share the eternal life, the life of God.... We often speak as if people were to be paid for being good; not as if the being good were itself God's highest gift and blessing" (Maurice). The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (B) for <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is worthy of notice. In verses 16, 17 St. John gives two reasons for shunning the world: because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the world is alien to the Father; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is passing away. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So here he gives two for holding fast the truth originally delivered to them: because the truth leads <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to fellowship with God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to eternal life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:24-29 The truth of Christ, abiding in us, is a means to sever from sin, and unites us to the Son of God, Joh 15:3,4. What value should we put upon gospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. The promise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. The apostle repeats the kind words, little children; which denotes his affection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige to gospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. The new spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born from above, from the Lord Christ. Then, let us beware of holding the truth in unrighteousness, remembering that those only are born of God, who bear his holy image, and walk in his most righteous ways.</body></html>
