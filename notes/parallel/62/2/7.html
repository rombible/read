To this section verses 7, 8 form an introduction, as chapter 1 John 1:5, 7 to the positive side. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beloved;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, is the true reading. Addresses of this kind commonly introduce a fresh division of the subject, main or subordinate. Thus <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1, 7</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-13.htm">1 John 3:13</a>). Sometimes, however, they introduce an earnest conclusion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> introduces a conclusion which serves as a fresh starting-point. Not a fresh commandment do I write to you, but an old commandment. Where it can be conveniently done, it is worth while distinguishing <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "fresh," as opposed to "worn out," "obsolete," from <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "new," as opposed to "old, aged." "New wine must be put into <span class="accented">fresh</span> skins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-22.htm">Mark 2:22</a>). Are two commandments meant - one to cultivate brotherly love, the other to walk as Christ walked? Or is there only one, which from different points of view may be regarded as either new or old? Commentators are divided; but the latter seems better. Then what is the commandment which is at once new and old? The whole gospel, or the command to love one another? <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a> and John 15:2 will incline us to the latter view. The command was old, for" Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) was part of the Mosaic Law. But the <span class="accented">standard</span> was new: "Even as I loved you;" "Even as he also walked;" and the <span class="accented">motive</span> was new: because "God so loved us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>). Brotherly love, enforced by such an example, and based on such a fact, was a new command as compared with the cold injunction of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">From the beginning</span> may have either of two senses: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from of old, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, long before the Gospel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the beginning of your career as Christians. This new and yet old command sums up the practical side of the gospel which had been preached to them from the first. The second <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> it spurious. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:3-11 What knowledge of Christ can that be, which sees not that he is most worthy of our entire obedience? And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.</body></html>
