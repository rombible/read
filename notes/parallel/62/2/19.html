The emphatic repetition of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, five times in one verse, is quite in St. John's style. The "no doubt" of the Authorized Version, rightly omitted in the Revised Version, probably represents the <span class="accented">utique</span> of the Vulgate, which is a mistaken attempt to give a separate word to translate <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span> (compare <span class="accented">forsitan</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-46.htm">John 5:46</a>.

This can hardly be right. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "That all of them are not of us;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, are aliens (verse 21; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-20.htm">Mark 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>).

This seems preferable. The renegade and apostate was all along only nominally a Christian. Of the true Christian the declaration remains true, "No one snatcheth them out of his hand." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 Every man is an antichrist, who denies the Person, or any of the offices of Christ; and in denying the Son, he denies the Father also, and has no part in his favour while he rejects his great salvation. Let this prophecy that seducers would rise in the Christian world, keep us from being seduced. The church knows not well who are its true members, and who are not, but thus true Christians were proved, and rendered more watchful and humble. True Christians are anointed ones; their names expresses this: they are anointed with grace, with gifts and spiritual privileges, by the Holy Spirit of grace. The great and most hurtful lies that the father of lies spreads in the world, usually are falsehoods and errors relating to the person of Christ. The unction from the Holy One, alone can keep us from delusions. While we judge favourably of all who trust in Christ as the Divine Saviour, and obey his word, and seek to live in union with them, let us pity and pray for those who deny the Godhead of Christ, or his atonement, and the new-creating work of the Holy Ghost. Let us protest against such antichristian doctrine, and keep from them as much as we may.</body></html>
