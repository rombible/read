The emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> again marks the emphatic contrast between St. John's readers and the antichrists. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> means "from Christ" (verse 20). The indicative <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> states what <span class="accented">ought</span> to be true of them, and is a delicate equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> (verse 24). The anointing of Christ <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> abides with them as a permanent gift, and renders further apostolic teaching unnecessary. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the superfluous teaching refers to the antichrists. The ideal to which the Christian must aspire is the being led into all truth by the Spirit; he will need no human teachers then (see the remarkable parallel to this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, and the quotation of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10, 11</a>). The construction in the middle of the verse is amphibolous. We may take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> either as the apodosis of <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you... so it is true") or as a continuation of the protasis, which is resumed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you... and is true... and even as"). Thereafter is better. The emphatic "and is no lie" is thoroughly Johannine (see on verse 23). The conclusion of the verse is doubtful also. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is certainly preferable to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> may be indicative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in the first clause, or imperative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in the next verse. The latter is more probable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:24-29 The truth of Christ, abiding in us, is a means to sever from sin, and unites us to the Son of God, Joh 15:3,4. What value should we put upon gospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. The promise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. The apostle repeats the kind words, little children; which denotes his affection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige to gospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. The new spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born from above, from the Lord Christ. Then, let us beware of holding the truth in unrighteousness, remembering that those only are born of God, who bear his holy image, and walk in his most righteous ways.</body></html>
