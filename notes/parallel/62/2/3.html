The test is, "obedience to the commandments, especially in brotherly love."<p>(3) Hereby means, <span class= "ital">by what follows.</span><p><span class= "bld">That we know him.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">have known Him</span> (so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1John 2:4</a>, <span class= "ital">I have known Him</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> that we have not grasped a shadow, but have been in intercourse with the living God, who reveals Himself not through speculation, but through a true inward life of man.<p><span class= "bld">If we keep his commandments.</span>--Christ's--because of the reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm" title="If you love me, keep my commandments.">John 14:15</a>. "Keep" like a precious heirloom, watching them against the inroads of our lower nature. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.">Matthew 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.

If each man's conscience was the standard of practice, confusion would again reign in morals as it reigned in the days of the Sophists at Athens. (Compare Plato's <span class= "ital">Republic, </span>Bk. 2, Jowett's translation.) A code and an example fitted for all times and all circumstances have been given by our Lord.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">He that saith . . .</span>--In particularising the general proposition according to his custom, St. John rejects the first person plural as shocking, unreal, and artificial, and throws the blasphemy on some third person. So "is a liar" is stronger than "we lie," and "we deceive ourselves;" in such a case the lie has entered thoroughly into the man's nature.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">But whoso keepeth his word.</span>--The revelation of the will of God, looked at as a whole.<p><span class= "bld">In him verily is the love of God perfected.</span>--St. John has before his mind an ideal of a man so filled with the Spirit that in all things he embodies the will of God; the love that such a man has for God is indeed complete. But he knows that the best of the human race can only approach such an ideal in different degrees, at a great distance; and the perfection of the love which they bear to God will vary in the same degree. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.">1John 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1John 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time.

"In him verily;" rather, <span class= "ital">Truly in him.</span> It is most emphatic, and refers back "the truth is not in him," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1John 2:4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Hereby know we that we are in him.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1John 2:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1John 1:6</a>; without such a test there Could be no happiness in religion.

In the terms of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1John 2:3-5</a> there is a double gradation: on the one hand, knowing Him, being in Him, remaining in Him; on the other, keeping His commandments, keeping His word, walking even as He walked. The last expression is the strongest of the latter three, as it views the Christian in action. The walk of Christ was the walk in the light (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1John 1:7</a>); divine love the secret spring developing itself in a new virtue for every variety of circumstance. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1John 2:7-11</a> brotherly love is introduced as the special manifestation of this obedience that springs from the walk in the light. At a superficial glance it might have been thought that the personal address introduced a new paragraph; it is really only like the "Verily, verily," of our Lord, breaking in to emphasize a message to be brought directly home to the hearts of the readers. The life of obedience, the walk in light, is nothing else but the life of brotherly love: "This is my commandment, that ye love one another" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-12.htm" title="This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.">John 15:12</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34-35</a>).<p>(7) <span class= "bld">I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., "</span>I am preparing to give you a special direction, which has been implied already by the walk in light. If you look at it from the point of view of your first entrance into Christ's kingdom it is old, because it was the chief point of His moral teaching which you then heard. If you look at its effect in you it is new, because (1) it had never been taught so forcibly and clearly before Christ; (2) you are so imperfect that you are always liable to forget it; (3) your obedience to the command can never be complete, but will always require fresh growth; (4) it can never be permanent without continual renewal by Christ's presence." "Ye" is therefore his present Christian audience; "<span class= "ital">from the beginning"</span> implies the time of their conversion; "<span class= "ital">the word"</span> is here less wide than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1John 2:6</a>, and means rather Christ's teaching on this point. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm" title="And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.">2John 1:5</a>; Leviticus 19, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-24.htm" title="Defile not you yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:">Leviticus 18:24</a>.)<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Which thing is true in him and in you.</span>--The commandment might have hung in the air and remained "old," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, confined to the definite point of time of its promulgation, had it not been embodied for ever (1) in the living example of Christ during His life on earth; (2) in His active presence and power since His resurrection; (3) in the conduct and character of His people, radically renewed by His Spirit and continually growing after His image. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1John 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">is passing away</span>; <span class= "ital">already shineth.</span> Here he gives the reason why he announces as new what he says is already truly realised in Christ and in process of realisation in His people. A visible change, a notable renovation, is going on; the gross darkness that covered the face of the earth is being rent away in the circle of the apostolic preaching; the life of the Lord, which gleamed forth for three-and-thirty years in the cities and on the hill-sides of Judaea and Samaria and Galilee, is now bursting far and wide into ever-increasing brightness; wondrously quick is the spread of the rays of His glory; multitudes in every known land are gathered into His kingdom. Old things are passing away as the Apostle looks round, and all things are becoming new. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm" title="For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:">Ephesians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" title="But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.">1Thessalonians 5:4-5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-6.</span> - Thirdly, walking in the light involves obedience. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And herein we perceive that we know him, if we keep his commandments</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, we come to know, we recognize; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, we have come to know, we know). The token of our having this knowledge is stated hypothetically; not <span class="accented">because</span>, but if, we obey. To serve under another and obey him is one of the best ways of knowing his character. The knowledge is no mere intellectual apprehension, such as the Gnostic, postulated, but a moral and spiritual affection and activity. It is possible to know and hate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm">John 16:24</a>). Again, the knowledge is not a mere emotional appreciation. Christianity knows nothing of piety without morality. To know Christ is to love him, and to love him is to obey and imitate him. By "keep" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is recant "keep the eye fixed upon, <span class="accented">observe."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:3-11 What knowledge of Christ can that be, which sees not that he is most worthy of our entire obedience? And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.</body></html>
