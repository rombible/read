From the lie St. John passes on to the utterer of it. "Ye readily distinguish any lie from the truth. Who, then, is the liar?" "The liar" does not mean the liar <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, as if this denial constituted the very acme of falsehood. To deny the very existence of God is surely a worse lie. Still less can we say that "the context leaves no doubt that 'the liar' is the same with 'the antichrist.'" The article <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> refers to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4, 5</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>. The very form of sentence is the same: <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> and there <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> cannot mean the victor, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, who is Christ, and not the believer. So that the Authorized Version is not so very inaccurate in rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> "a liar." "Who tells lies, if not he who denies (and says) that Jesus is not the Christ?" This was the great Gnostic lie to which St. John's Gospel and Epistle give the answer. The antichrist is this, he who denieth the Father and the Son. "The antichrist" here is not the great adversary, but one having similar characteristics. He denies the Messiahship of Jesus, and thus virtually denies both the Father and Son (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>). This truth St. John proceeds to restate and develop. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 Every man is an antichrist, who denies the Person, or any of the offices of Christ; and in denying the Son, he denies the Father also, and has no part in his favour while he rejects his great salvation. Let this prophecy that seducers would rise in the Christian world, keep us from being seduced. The church knows not well who are its true members, and who are not, but thus true Christians were proved, and rendered more watchful and humble. True Christians are anointed ones; their names expresses this: they are anointed with grace, with gifts and spiritual privileges, by the Holy Spirit of grace. The great and most hurtful lies that the father of lies spreads in the world, usually are falsehoods and errors relating to the person of Christ. The unction from the Holy One, alone can keep us from delusions. While we judge favourably of all who trust in Christ as the Divine Saviour, and obey his word, and seek to live in union with them, let us pity and pray for those who deny the Godhead of Christ, or his atonement, and the new-creating work of the Holy Ghost. Let us protest against such antichristian doctrine, and keep from them as much as we may.</body></html>
