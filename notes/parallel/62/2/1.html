It is the doctrine of Reconciliation and Redemption. St. John does not wish them to contemplate with complacency the probability of sinning; but to remember gratefully, in spite of falls, that the Author and Restorer of Light has provided a remedy both for the offence before God, and for its effect on themselves. First comes the principle that we must not sin; second, the admission that we do sin; third, the consolation for actual sin when it is in spite of sincere zeal for sanctification.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">My little children.</span>--Six times in the letter occurs this diminutive of tender and caressing love: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1John 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1John 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.">1John 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm" title="You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.">1John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm" title="Little children, keep yourselves from idols.

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>.) The thought of the shame and misery of sin melted his heart. "My child" was what he called out to the lapsed youth, according to Eusebius (<span class= "ital">H.

It has two meanings; one, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm" title="I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are you all.">Job 16:2</a>, he who comforts, or exhorts; the other, as here, he who is appealed to--a proxy, or attorney. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.">Romans 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>.) The Redeemer, the Word made flesh, and reascended with His human nature, is that part of the Deity which assures us of the ever-active vitality of divine love. If the justice of God is connected most with the Father, the mercy is pledged by the Son. He has exalted our nature, undertaken our interests, presents our prayers, and will one day be surrounded by the countless millions of His human brothers whom He has rescued, wearing the same nature as Himself. He is represented as continuing our advocate, because otherwise His work might appear a mere separate earthly manifestation; "righteous," because Christ, the only blameless example of human nature, can alone intercede for it with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8-10</a>). The Armenian translation actually adds "and blameless." Augustine remarks that St. John did not set forth any apostle or saint as intercessor (here, if anywhere, he would have done so), but only Christ. "We" is not the Church corporately, but merely another instance of St. John's kindly delicacy, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1John 1:6</a>, &c.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">And he is the propitiation for our sins.</span>--On the word "propitiation," see the Introduction.

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1John 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-5.htm" title="Thomas said to him, Lord, we know not where you go; and how can we know the way?">John 14:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;">2Corinthians 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-20.htm" title="By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;">Hebrews 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21-24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</span>--This statement must not be limited. Its scope is that Christ's redemption was offered for the whole of mankind, from Adam to the last man. Who lay hold of the redemption, must be determined on other considerations. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-14.htm" title="And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.">1John 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-42.htm" title="And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.">John 4:42</a>.) Multitudes may be saved through this redemption who never heard of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14-15</a>). St. John's object in introducing this truth here is to rebuke the arrogance of those Christians who looked down on the non-Christian world as outside the Fatherhood and mercies of God. Such an error might be seen, for example, in the heated partisanship of a Crusader or persecutor for a civilisation politically Christian against one outside his own sympathies. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/3-2.htm" title="To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness to all men.">Titus 3:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - Moreover, walking in the light involves accepting the propitiation wrought through Jesus Christ the Righteous.

The word occurs only once outside this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>), and it was, perhaps, from Christ's use of it then that St. John adopted it (verses 12, 28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a> the reading is doubtful Cf. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>; in the beautiful story of St. John and the young robber (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' III. 23:17). As distinct from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-13.htm">1 John 2:13, 18</a>), the word seems to imply spiritual fatherhood. <span class="cmt_word">These things</span> (the section, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5-10</a>) <span class="cmt_word">I write to you, that ye may not sin.</span> The aorist forbids the rendering, "continue in sin;" as before, those who are walking in light and yet sin through frailty are addressed. Two apparently contradictory principles have been set forth: you must walk in light; you must confess that you sin. St. John now goes on to reconcile them. I write <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to charge you not to sin; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> [to tell you that] if we sin, we have an Advocate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Instead of understanding "to tell you that," we may take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> as "and yet" - a frequent use in St. John. There are two seemingly opposite truths - sin is wholly alien from the Christian, and the Christian is never wholly free from sin; and St. John struggles to give them their right balance, not in the dialectical manner of St. Paul, but by stating them alternately, side by side, varying the point of view. <span class="cmt_word">We have an Advocate.</span> The possession of the Advocate is as continual <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as of the sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>). Every one feels that "a <span class="accented">Comforter</span> with the Father" is an impossible rendering. But St. John alone uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, four times in his Gospel of the Spirit (see on John 14:16), and once here of Christ. Is it likely that he would use so unusual and important a word <span class="accented">in two different senses</span>, and that in two writings intended as <span class="accented">companions to one another?</span> The rendering "Advocate," necessary here, carries with it the rendering "Advocate" in the Gospel. Moreover, what is the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, if Christ is an <span class="accented">Advocate</span>, but the Spirit a <span class="accented">Comforter?</span> If Christ is one Advocate and the Spirit "another Advocate," all is intelligible. Philo frequently uses <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the high priest as intercessor for the people, and also of the Divine <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. There is a difference, however, between "Paraclete" as used of the Spirit and as used of Christ. It is applied to the Spirit in his relation to the disciples; to Christ in his relation to the Father. Christ is our Advocate <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>: his advocacy <span class="accented">turns towards</span> the Father to propitiate him. And not in vain; for he is himself "righteous." A sinner could not reconcile God to sinners; but a righteous Advocate can, for his character is a warrant for the righteousness of his cause. Thus, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the set-off to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>. One who has sinned needs an advocate; one who has not sinned can best undertake the office. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> at the end, without the article, is gently suggestive of the plea, "Jesus Christ, <span class="accented">a Righteous One."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1,2 When have an Advocate with the Father; one who has undertaken, and is fully able, to plead in behalf of every one who applies for pardon and salvation in his name, depending on his pleading for them. He is Jesus, the Saviour, and Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed. He alone is the Righteous One, who received his nature pure from sin, and as our Surety perfectly obeyed the law of God, and so fulfilled all righteousness. All men, in every land, and through successive generations, are invited to come to God through this all-sufficient atonement, and by this new and living way. The gospel, when rightly understood and received, sets the heart against all sin, and stops the allowed practice of it; at the same time it gives blessed relief to the wounded consciences of those who have sinned.</body></html>
