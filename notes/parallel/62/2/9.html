And as He, by being the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, had declared the universality of God's family and kingdom, so the sympathy of believers would extend in different degrees as far as the whole human race; to those first who were conscious of the same hopes as themselves; to those next who might be brought to share them; to those, perhaps, in a less degree, who in every nation feared God and worked righteousness without knowing the Saviour personally; and so on, finally, to all who did not wilfully excommunicate themselves. But the brotherly love would be chiefly amongst Christian friends, else it would be diffused into nothingness.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">He that saith . . .</span>--The whole history of religious rancour has been a deplorable illustration of these words. Controversy for principles honestly and reasonably held is one thing: prejudice, spite, private censures and condemnations, harsh words, suspicions, jealousies, misunderstandings and misrepresentations are the chief props of the kingdom of darkness among Christian churches and nations. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-12.htm" title="This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.">John 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-7.htm" title="And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.">2Peter 1:7-9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Hateth</span> means not merely the absence of love, but the presence, in ever so small a degree, of dislike or any of the feelings already described, or those kindred to them.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">He that loveth</span>.--From the associations connected with love in poetry and romance this saying sounds strange. But all such love is tinged with passion, and the desire of satisfying some personal lack; this is the pure disinterested seeking for another's welfare, of which Christ was the great example. It is that which the modern scientific non-Christian world is trying to make its religion; but without the Christian motive, and cultivated for its own sake instead of by the working of the Spirit of God, it seems artificial and powerless.<p><span class= "bld">Occasion of stumbling.</span>--<span class= "ital">Stumbling</span> - <span class= "ital">blok.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-165.htm" title="Great peace have they which love your law: and nothing shall offend them.">Psalm 119:165</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

These verses set forth in a variety of forms the affinity between love and light, hatred and darkness, and the consequent incompatibility between hatred and light. "Hate" <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is not to be watered down into "neglect" or "fail to love." St. John knows nothing of such compromises. Love is love, and hate is hate, and between the two there is no neutral ground, any more than between life and death, or between Christ and antichrist. "He that is not with me is against me." "Love is the moral counterpart of intellectual light. It is a modern fashion to represent these two tempers as necessarily opposed. But St. John is at once earnestly dogmatic and earnestly philanthropic; for the Incarnation has taught him both the preciousness of man and the preciousness of truth" (Liddon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that saith.</span> For the fifth time St. John points out a glaring inconsistency which is possible between profession and fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6, 8, 10</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4</a>.9); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>. In all these passages the case is put hypothetically; but in some of the Gnostic teaching of the age this inconsistency existed beyond a doubt. Is in darkness even until now. His supposing that hatred is compatible with light proves the darkness in which he is. Nay, more, it shows that, in spite of his having nominally entered the company of the children of light, he has really never left the darkness. "If ye loved only your brethren, ye would not yet be perfect; but if ye hate your brethren, what are ye? where are ye?" (St. Augustine). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:3-11 What knowledge of Christ can that be, which sees not that he is most worthy of our entire obedience? And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.</body></html>
