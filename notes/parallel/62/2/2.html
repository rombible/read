St. Paul's word is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-11.htm">Romans 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm">Romans 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18, 19</a>). They are not equivalents; <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> has reference to the one party to be propitiated, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> to the two parties to be reconciled. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a third word expressing yet another aspect of the atonement - the redemption of the offending party by payment of his debt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>, etc.). Although <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> does not necessarily include the idea of sacrifice, yet the use of the word in the LXX, and of <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (Hebrews 2:27) and <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>) in the New Testament, points to the expiation wrought by the great High Priest by the sacrifice of himself. It is <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and not <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, because the prominent fact is Christ as an Offering rather than as One who offers. With the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-46.htm">John 8:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>. Our sins are the <span class="accented">subject-matter</span> of his propitiatory work. <span class="cmt_word">And not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.</span> Again we seem to have an echo of the prayer of the great High Priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20, 24</a>). The propitiation is for all, not for the first band of believers only. The sins of the whole world are expiated; and if the expiation does not effect the salvation of the sinner, it is because he rejects it, loving the darkness rather than the light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>). No man - Christian, Jew, or Gentile - is outside the mercy of God, unless he places himself there deliberately. "It seems clear that the sacrifice of Christ, though peculiarly and completely available only for those who were called, does in some particulars benefit the whole world, and release it from the evil in which the whole creation was travailing" (Jelf). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1,2 When have an Advocate with the Father; one who has undertaken, and is fully able, to plead in behalf of every one who applies for pardon and salvation in his name, depending on his pleading for them. He is Jesus, the Saviour, and Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed. He alone is the Righteous One, who received his nature pure from sin, and as our Surety perfectly obeyed the law of God, and so fulfilled all righteousness. All men, in every land, and through successive generations, are invited to come to God through this all-sufficient atonement, and by this new and living way. The gospel, when rightly understood and received, sets the heart against all sin, and stops the allowed practice of it; at the same time it gives blessed relief to the wounded consciences of those who have sinned.</body></html>
