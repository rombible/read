"These things" refers to what precedes, especially verses 18-23, as distinct from what now follows. The present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> indicates the continual attempt of these false teachers to lead the "little children" astray. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>, as in verse 21, is the "epistolary aorist" (see on 2 John 1:4). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:24-29 The truth of Christ, abiding in us, is a means to sever from sin, and unites us to the Son of God, Joh 15:3,4. What value should we put upon gospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. The promise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. The apostle repeats the kind words, little children; which denotes his affection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige to gospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. The new spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born from above, from the Lord Christ. Then, let us beware of holding the truth in unrighteousness, remembering that those only are born of God, who bear his holy image, and walk in his most righteous ways.</body></html>
