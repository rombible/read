"He who says that he abides in God is by his words morally bound to walk even as his Son, the incarnate Revelation of his will, walked." The change from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> confirms the view that <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> mean the Father; but St. John's use of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to recall with emphasis a previous subject (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8, 18, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-11.htm">John 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>) makes this argument inconclusive. To be or abide in God or in Christ implies an <span class="accented">habitual condition</span>, not isolated apprehensions of his presence. Obedience, not feeling, is the test of union; and the Christian who is really such has least to tell of "experiences" of special visitations. He who is ever in the light has few sensible illuminations to record. Note the strong <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">even as</span> (not merely <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>, as); nothing less than "the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>) is to be aimed at. "Ye therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:3-11 What knowledge of Christ can that be, which sees not that he is most worthy of our entire obedience? And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.</body></html>
