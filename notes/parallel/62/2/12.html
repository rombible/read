He cannot bear even to seem to suggest that his "dear little children" are shrouded in the gloomy horrors of moral darkness, haunted by the faithful memories of their sins, and enticed hither and thither by the malevolent spirits of evil. He will warn them with the most tender and pitiful affection against the wicked one, the world, the flesh, the follies and vanities of the human heart; but first he will show them frankly what he thinks of them, what he hopes of them, the trust he places in them, the grounds which he takes for granted in writing to them.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">I write unto you, little children.</span>--The arrangement of these triplets should be prefaced by saying that the last "I write," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.">1John 2:13</a>, is, according to the best reading, "I wrote," or "I have written;" and that the "little children" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1John 2:12</a> is the same word as that which he used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1John 2:1</a> for the whole class of his readers, and is therefore quite general, but that the "little children" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.">1John 2:13</a> is a different, word, meaning children in age. So we get:--<p><span class= "ital">I write.</span><p><span class= "ital">I wrote.</span><p>1.All readers.<p>1.Children in age. [Suggested, according to the perfect simplicity of St. John's style, by the term used in the first set for his readers generally<span class= "ital">.</span>]<p>2.Fathers.<p>2.Fathers.<p>3.Youths.<p>3.Youths.<p><span class= "ital">Reasons.</span><p>1.Forgiveness.<p>1.Knowledge of the Father.<p>2.Knowledge of Christ.<p>2.Knowledge of Christ.<p>3.Victory.<p>3.Strength, perseverance, victory.<p>Some have thought the second triplet an explanatory note that has crept into the text; others that "I write refers to what he is doing at the moment, "I wrote" the view they would take when they read what he had written. It seems better, however, if we allow the Gospel to have been written first, to refer "I am writing" to the Epistle; "I did write" to the Gospel.<p><span class= "bld">Because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">have been forgiven.</span> When Christ expired on the cross, the sins of all were forgiven who should in after-time believe and carry on their repentance towards perfection. The process is realised in the soul when it wakes up to a sense of love of the Saviour through faith.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Fathers.</span>--The heads of families.<p><span class= "bld">Him that is from the beginning.</span>--There can be little doubt that this means the same Person as the subject of "His name's sake." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; Knowledge of Christ is assigned in both cases as the reason for addressing the elder members of his audience, because fully to understand the work, the doctrine, the example of Christ, is a work fitted for mature thought. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1Corinthians 3:1-2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Young men.</span>--They might be regarded more as still engaged in the work of settling their character, forming their habits, disciplining their inclinations, confirming the choice which all must make for themselves between good and evil. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm" title="Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.">2Timothy 2:22</a>.) St. John is not here addressing those who have failed in the struggle and not repented, but those who have got the better of such temptations, or are in process of getting it.<p><span class= "bld">The wicked one.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.">1John 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1John 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-19.htm" title="When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, then comes the wicked one, and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.">Matthew 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a>.)<p>(14) <span class= "bld">Because ye have known</span>.--To those who have once begun to understand Christ, the topic must always be delightful and interesting.<p><span class= "bld">Because ye are strong.</span>--For the reasons mentioned before, young men have more special need of strength. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-9.htm" title="Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to your word.">Psalm 119:9</a>.) This power can only come through the presence of the message and teaching of God in their hearts, which will be brought by faith in Christ, acceptance of His redemption, and reverential study of His example. When Christ has thus dwelt in their minds, then the victory is won, and the spirits of evil can no longer entice them.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Love not the world.</span>--Having thus affectionately expressed his hopes about each class of them, the last of the Apostles is freer to express that warning which was suggested to his mind by the mournful picture of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1John 2:11</a>. If they would not walk in darkness--if they would be where the true Light shineth--then they must not love the world. What does "the world" mean? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-24.htm" title="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;">Acts 17:24</a> it meant the universe; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>, perhaps more distinctly, the earth; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a> the sum total of mankind; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.">John 8:23</a> that moral order, to be found in this spot of creation, which is antagonistic to God. Thus it became a phrase for all such inventions, plans, customs, thoughts, and estimates of mankind as are not in harmony with the will and purpose of God. It is ridiculous to suppose that St. John intended to condemn the love either of natural philosophy; or of the scenery of that creation which God saw to be very good, and which sin has been unable to injure; or of all mankind, who are His children. No created thing is evil in itself; the evil lies in the use which man makes of it. We must remember that our Lord said, "I am the Light of the World" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>), so that none of the phases of the meaning of the word can be essentially evil, except where it implies man's own ungodly creations. The world which is not to be loved is the sphere of rebellion, caprice, ambition, vanity, pride, avarice, forgetfulness of God, self-pleasing, sensuous desires and interests, connivance with standards of thought and action antagonistic to the will of God. To take one example: Christ declared all Christians brothers; any respect for rank and wealth beyond a conscientious "bowing in the house of Rimmon" is a sign of the forbidden affection.<p><span class= "bld">The love of the Father</span> is the true posture of the soul towards God. If the soul is evenly balanced between love of God and of the world it is negative and colourless. If the balance incline towards the things that distract from the pure and simple walk with God, then the emotion for Him has died away; if the balance be for Him, "the expulsive power of the new affection" makes the contrary attractions insignificant and increasingly powerless.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">All that is in the world.</span>--The essence, the kernel of this sphere showing itself in countless ways.<p><span class= "bld">The lust of the flesh</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, that proceeds from the earthly nature; all desire taking possession of the soul as a motive for thought and action which does not arise from principles in harmony with the will of God.<p><span class= "bld">The lust of the eyes</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of which the eyes are the seat; all delight in objects living or inanimate apart from their moral and religious importance; personal beauty, for instance, considered otherwise than as an index of a Christ-like soul.

Our Lord's, introspection was of moral qualities in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-21.htm" title="Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.">Mark 10:21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The pride of life.</span>--The Greek word is only used besides in the New Testament in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-16.htm" title="But now you rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.">James 4:16</a>. The phrase means a boastful, ostentatious attitude in regard to the good things of this life allotted by God to be spent in His service. All living up to a supposed social position instead of as the responsible steward of undeserved bounties, is hereby condemned. Of this any social organism existing for pleasure instead of for moral or religious ends might be considered illustrative.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">The world passeth away.</span>--No reasonable man can set his affections on what is in its very essence perishable; for the perishable must be ever disappointing, and can in no sense satisfy. It is only passion, and the madness of folly, and the contagion of accumulated examples, that influence the soul towards what can only create the agonising ache of a growing void.<p><span class= "bld">And the lust thereof.</span>--Of all the long succession of impulses excited by the world, nothing remains but the injury which they have inflicted.<p><span class= "bld">But he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever</span>.--There is no permanence but that of defeat and failure in what is in rebellion to the Supreme Author and Ruler of all things. But that which has continuously derived all its sustenance from Him, must have absorbed from Him the "bright shoots" of that "everlastingness" which is His. Everything that is good is a part of Him, and can no more fade than He can. It is by being in harmony with this undeviating tendency of righteousness to victory that real happiness discovers its own secret.

This suggests several questions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">What is the difference between</span> "I <span class="accented">write"</span> (<span class="accented">or</span>, "am writing") and "I <span class="accented">wrote"</span> (or, "have <span class="accented">written</span>;" for this is a case where the English perfect may represent the Greek aorist)? Five answers are given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The change is made for <span class="accented">emphasis:</span> "I write; I wrote; there is nothing more to be said." But in this case the past tense should come first: "I wrote; I write it again." Moreover, we should expect the perfect rather than the aorist, as in <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "I write" refers to what <span class="accented">follows</span>; "I wrote," to <span class="accented">what precedes.</span> And some have even tried to find out the three different portions in each part of the Epistle; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "I <span class="accented">write to</span> you, little children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15-17</a>); "to you, fathers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18-27</a>); "to you, young men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28-3:22</a>): "I <span class="accented">wrote</span> to you, children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5-7</a>); "to you, fathers" (chapter 1:8-2:2); "to you, young men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-11</a>). But this is fanciful and very arbitrary; and in this case also the past tense should come first: "I have written thus far to you; again I proceed to write to you." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "I write" refers to the <span class="accented">whole Epistle</span>; "I wrote," to what <span class="accented">precedes.</span> This answer has the sanction of the 'Speaker's Commentary;' but it seems to be quite frivolous. What could induce St. John first of all to tell each class that he writes the <span class="accented">whole</span> Epistle to them, and then to tell them that he wrote the <span class="accented">first part of it</span> to them? There would be little enough sense in first saying that he wrote the beginning to them, and then that he writes the whole to them; but there is no sense in the former statement if it comes after the latter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> "I am writing" is <span class="accented">from St. John's point of view</span>, as he pens the growing letter. "I wrote" is from <span class="accented">the readers' point of view</span>, as they peruse the completed letter. But what is gained by this change of standpoint? Is it probable that St. John would make three distinct addresses in the position of the writer of the Epistle, and then solemnly repeat them in the position of the recipients of it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The Epistle is written as a companion to the Gospel: therefore "I write" refers <span class="accented">to the Epistle</span>, which he is in the act of composing; "I wrote," to <span class="accented">the Gospel</span>, which lies completed before him, and on which the Epistle serves as a commentary. This seems to be the most satisfactory explanation (see on chapter 1 John 1:4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Who are indicated by the three classes?</span> In the first triplet, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as elsewhere in the Epistle (verses 1, 28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4, 5, 21</a>), refers to his readers as a whole, of whom <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> are two component divisions. This is probably the case in the second triplet also, although the change from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> renders this a little doubtful (see on verse 13). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Does the difference between "fathers" and</span> "young <span class="accented">men" refer to age as men or age as Christians?</span> Probably the former. In both Gospel and Epistle St. John writes to mature and well-instructed Christians. The following table will illustrate the view taken: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">I write this Epistle</span>: ? <span class="accented">Reasons for writing it</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To all of you. ? You have been forgiven.<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To the old among you ? You have knowledge of the Word.<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To the young among you. ? You have conquered the evil one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">I wrote my Gospel</span>: ? <span class="accented">Reasons for writing it</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To all of you (?). ? You have knowledge of the Father.<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To the old among you ? You have knowledge of the Word.<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To the young among you. ? You have strength, have God's revelation in your hearts, and have conquered the evil one. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am writing to you, little children</span> (see on verse 1), because, etc. Beyond reasonable doubt, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, is "because," not "that," in verses 12-14; it gives the reason for his writing, not the substance of what he has to say (cf. verse 21). For his Name's sake must refer to Christ, not only because of the context, but also of the instrumental <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-13.htm">1 John 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>); and Christ's Name means his character, especially as Saviour. Because they have already partaken of the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (verse 2), and have had their sins washed away in the blood of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>), therefore he writes to them this Epistle. Note the perfects throughout, indicating the permanent result of past action: <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x2e;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-14 As Christians have their peculiar states, so they have peculiar duties; but there are precepts and obedience common to all, particularly mutual love, and contempt of the world. The youngest sincere disciple is pardoned: the communion of saints is attended with the forgiveness of sins. Those of the longest standing in Christ's school need further advice and instruction. Even fathers must be written unto, and preached unto; none are too old to learn. But especially young men in Christ Jesus, though they are arrived at strength of spirit and sound sense, and have successfully resisted first trials and temptations, breaking off bad habits and connexions, and entered in at the strait gate of true conversion. The different descriptions of Christians are again addressed. Children in Christ know that God is their Father; it is wisdom. Those advanced believers, who know Him that was from the beginning, before this world was made, may well be led thereby to give up this world. It will be the glory of young persons to be strong in Christ, and his grace. By the word of God they overcome the wicked one.</body></html>
