From the particle au; the reflexive pronoun self, used of the third person, and of the other persons.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Once more (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7, 9</a>) the opposite is stated and the thought carried further. <span class="cmt_word">But whoso keepeth his word</span> (his doctrine as a whole, including the separate commandments), <span class="cmt_word">of a truth in him hath the love of God been perfected;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as an accomplished fact; the relation of love has been established. In St. John <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> is no mere expletive; it expresses reality, and reality that is <span class="accented">known.</span> From verse 4 we might have expected "of a truth <span class="accented">he knoweth God</span>;" but the apostle goes beyond this, and shows that really knowing God involves loving him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>). The context shows that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is objective - his love of God rather than God's love of him. The insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> here, and the drift of the Epistle thus far, are in favour of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in verses 3-5 meaning God rather than Christ, although <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in verse 2 tells the other way. The last clause sums up and reaffirms, but as usual with a new turn of thought, the whole section (verses 3-5), which begins and ends with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Knowing God implies keeping his Word; and keeping his Word involves loving him; and all this implies being in him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, having that fellowship with him and his Son in which the Christian's life (which is eternal life) consists, and to promote which St. John publishes his Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3, 4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:3-11 What knowledge of Christ can that be, which sees not that he is most worthy of our entire obedience? And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.</body></html>
