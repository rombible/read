"The false teachers have the spirit of antichrist; ye have a chrism from the Christ." The Johannine <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> places the two antithetical groups side by side, while the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>) accentuates the contrast. And ye have an anointing from the Holy One. The unction or chrism is the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27</a>). As Christ was anointed with the Spirit in all fullness, so each Christian is anointed with him in his measure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-21.htm">2 Corinthians 1:21, 22</a>). The twenty-first 'Catechetical Lecture' of St. Cyril, "On the Holy Chrism," should be read in illustration of this verse. "In apostolic language, each Christian is in due measure himself a Christ, empowered by the gift of the Holy Spirit to announce the truth which he has learnt, to apply the atonement which he has received, to establish the kingdom which he believes to be universal" (Westcott). The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> depends on <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, not on <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The Holy One is Jesus Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-69.htm">John 6:69</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7, 13</a>). It is hard to decide between three readings: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "and ye know all things" necessary to salvation, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "the truth" (verse 21; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "and ye all know" that ye have this anointing; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>," ye all know - I did not write to you because ye know not the truth." There is evidence of a fourth variation, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> "ye know all" the antichrists. If <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> be right, it does not mean that the Christian is omniscient, but that he has the basis of all knowledge; he can see things in their right proportions. The <span class="accented">apostle's</span> own disciple, St. Polycarp, writes to the Philippians <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 Every man is an antichrist, who denies the Person, or any of the offices of Christ; and in denying the Son, he denies the Father also, and has no part in his favour while he rejects his great salvation. Let this prophecy that seducers would rise in the Christian world, keep us from being seduced. The church knows not well who are its true members, and who are not, but thus true Christians were proved, and rendered more watchful and humble. True Christians are anointed ones; their names expresses this: they are anointed with grace, with gifts and spiritual privileges, by the Holy Spirit of grace. The great and most hurtful lies that the father of lies spreads in the world, usually are falsehoods and errors relating to the person of Christ. The unction from the Holy One, alone can keep us from delusions. While we judge favourably of all who trust in Christ as the Divine Saviour, and obey his word, and seek to live in union with them, let us pity and pray for those who deny the Godhead of Christ, or his atonement, and the new-creating work of the Holy Ghost. Let us protest against such antichristian doctrine, and keep from them as much as we may.</body></html>
