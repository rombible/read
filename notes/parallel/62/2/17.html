Not the former, for its object is already passing away; while not only does the Father abide for ever, but he who loves him and does his will abides for ever also. The antithesis, as usual, is a progress; it carries us beyond the limits of the original statement. The world is passing away like a dissolving view. It has its sentence of death in itself; its decay has begun. And even if it were not passing away, our capacity for enjoying it would none the less certainly come to an end. "The sensualist does not know what the delights of sense are; he is out of temper when he is denied them; he is out of temper when he possesses them" (Maurice). To love the world is to lose everything, including the thing loved. To love God is to gain him and his kingdom. Some men would have it that the external world is the one thing that is certain and permanent, while religion is based on a mere hypothesis, and is ever changing its form. St. John assures us that the very reverse is the case. The world is waning: it is God alone and his faithful servants who abide. As St. Augustine says, "What can the world promise? Let it promise what you will, it makes the promise, perhaps, to one who tomorrow will die." <span class="cmt_word">The will of God</span> is the exact antithesis of "all that is in the world." The one is the good power "that makes for righteousness;" the other is the sum of the evil powers which make for sin. Abideth for ever is literally, <span class="accented">abideth unto the age</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). The notion of endlessness is, perhaps, not distinctly included; for that we should rather have had <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>). The contrast is not between "passing away" and "lasting <span class="accented">forever,"</span> but between "passing away" and <span class="accented">abiding</span> till "the age" comes. But as "the age" is the age of eternity as distinguished from this age of time, the rendering "abideth for ever" is justified. The Jews used" this age" and" the age to come" to distinguish the periods before and after the coming of the Messiah. Christians adopted the same phrases to indicate the periods before and after Christ's second coming; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm">Luke 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>), as opposed to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>), and very frequently, as here and throughout St. John's Gospel and Epistles, simply <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>.

The exact meaning here, therefore, is "abideth unto the age," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the coming of Christ's eternal kingdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-17 The things of the world may be desired and possessed for the uses and purposes which God intended, and they are to be used by his grace, and to his glory; but believers must not seek or value them for those purposes to which sin abuses them. The world draws the heart from God; and the more the love of the world prevails, the more the love of God decays. The things of the world are classed according to the three ruling inclinations of depraved nature. 1. The lust of the flesh, of the body: wrong desires of the heart, the appetite of indulging all things that excite and inflame sensual pleasures. 2. The lust of the eyes: the eyes are delighted with riches and rich possessions; this is the lust of covetousness. 3. The pride of life: a vain man craves the grandeur and pomp of a vain-glorious life; this includes thirst after honour and applause. The things of the world quickly fade and die away; desire itself will ere long fail and cease, but holy affection is not like the lust that passes away. The love of God shall never fail. Many vain efforts have been made to evade the force of this passage by limitations, distinctions, or exceptions. Many have tried to show how far we may be carnally-minded, and love the world; but the plain meaning of these verses cannot easily be mistaken. Unless this victory over the world is begun in the heart, a man has no root in himself, but will fall away, or at most remain an unfruitful professor. Yet these vanities are so alluring to the corruption in our hearts, that without constant watching and prayer, we cannot escape the world, or obtain victory over the god and prince of it.</body></html>
