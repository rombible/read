This is another form of darkness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Love not the world.</span> Obviously, both "love" and "the world" are used in a different sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where it is said that "God loved the world." The one love is selfish, the other unselfish. In the one case "the world" means the sinful elements of human life, in the other the human race. It is most important to distinguish the different meanings of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the New Testament. Connected with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="accented">comere</span>, it means <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> ornament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the ordered universe, <span class="accented">mundus</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the inhabitants of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <span class="accented">all that is alienated from God</span>, as here and frequently in St. John's writings. <span class="cmt_word">The things of the world</span> are not those things in the world which may become objects of sinful affection, such as wealth or honour, still less such as scenery or physical objects. St. John is not condemning a love of those material advantages which are God's gifts, nor of nature, which is God's work. He is forbidding those things the love of which rivals and excludes the love of God - all those immoral tendencies and pursuits which give the world its evil character. The world <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is order; the things in the world are the elements of disorder - those things which arise from each man making himself the center of the world, or of some little world of his own creation. These rival centers clash with one another, and also with the one true Center. All this St. John forbids. With <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-25.htm">John 2:25</a>). Note the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), <span class="accented">nor yet:</span> "Love not the world; no, nor any of its ways." As so often, St. John goes on to enforce his words by a negative statement of similar but not identical import. Love of the world absolutely excludes the love of the Father. "Ye cannot serve God and mammon." Some important authorities have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; the balance is decidedly for the latter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-17 The things of the world may be desired and possessed for the uses and purposes which God intended, and they are to be used by his grace, and to his glory; but believers must not seek or value them for those purposes to which sin abuses them. The world draws the heart from God; and the more the love of the world prevails, the more the love of God decays. The things of the world are classed according to the three ruling inclinations of depraved nature. 1. The lust of the flesh, of the body: wrong desires of the heart, the appetite of indulging all things that excite and inflame sensual pleasures. 2. The lust of the eyes: the eyes are delighted with riches and rich possessions; this is the lust of covetousness. 3. The pride of life: a vain man craves the grandeur and pomp of a vain-glorious life; this includes thirst after honour and applause. The things of the world quickly fade and die away; desire itself will ere long fail and cease, but holy affection is not like the lust that passes away. The love of God shall never fail. Many vain efforts have been made to evade the force of this passage by limitations, distinctions, or exceptions. Many have tried to show how far we may be carnally-minded, and love the world; but the plain meaning of these verses cannot easily be mistaken. Unless this victory over the world is begun in the heart, a man has no root in himself, but will fall away, or at most remain an unfruitful professor. Yet these vanities are so alluring to the corruption in our hearts, that without constant watching and prayer, we cannot escape the world, or obtain victory over the god and prince of it.</body></html>
