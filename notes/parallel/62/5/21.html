The aorist, rather than the present imperative, is used to make the command more forcible, although the guarding is not momentary, but will have to continue (Compare <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). What is the meaning of "the idols" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> here? In answering this question it will be well to hold fast to the common canon of exegesis, that <span class="accented">where the literal interpretation makes good sense, the literal interpretation is probably right.</span> Here the literal interpretation makes excellent sense. Ephesus was famous for its idols. To be "temple-keeper of the great Artemis" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>) was its pride. The moral evils which had resulted from the abuse of the right of sanctuary had caused the Roman senate to cite the Ephesians and other states to submit their charters to the government for inspection. Ephesus had been the first to answer to the summons, and had strenuously defended its claims. It was famous, moreover, for its charms and incantations; and folly of this kind had found its way into the Christian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13-20</a>). As so often happens with converts from a religion full of gross superstition, a good many of the superstitious observances survived the adoption of Christianity. With facts such as these before us, we can hardly be wrong in interpreting "the idols" quite literally. The apostle's "little children" could not live in Ephesus without coming constantly in contact with these polluting but attractive influences. They must have absolutely nothing to do with them: "Guard yourselves and abjure <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> them." Of course, this literal interpretation places no limit on the <span class="accented">application</span> of the text. To a Christian anything is an idol which <span class="accented">usurps</span> the place of God in the heart, whether this be a person, or a system, or a project, or wealth, or what not. All such usurpations come within the sweep of the apostle's injunction, "Guard yourselves from your idols." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:18-21 All mankind are divided into two parties or dominions; that which belongs to God, and that which belongs to the wicked one. True believers belong to God: they are of God, and from him, and to him, and for him; while the rest, by far the greater number, are in the power of the wicked one; they do his works, and support his cause. This general declaration includes all unbelievers, whatever their profession, station, or situation, or by whatever name they may be called. The Son leads believers to the Father, and they are in the love and favour of both; in union with both, by the indwelling and working of the Holy Spirit. Happy are those to whom it is given to know that the Son of God is come, and to have a heart to trust in and rely on him that is true! May this be our privilege; we shall thus be kept from all idols and false doctrines, and from the idolatrous love of worldly objects, and be kept by the power of God, through faith, unto eternal salvation. To this living and true God, be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</body></html>
