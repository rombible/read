But there is another faculty which has to regulate, purify, direct, and stir up our weak and imperfect loving powers, and that is, faith. Without faith we cannot be certain about the quality of our love. He begins very simply with a position already laid down: genuine faith in Christ is the genuine birth from God. From that faith, through that birth, will come the proper love, as in a family: the love of our spiritual brothers and sisters. (This is specially sympathy with real Christians; but it does not exclude the more general love before inculcated.) If we are doubtful about the quality of our love, or are not sure whether any earthly elements may be mingled with it, we have only to ask ourselves whether we are loving God and keeping His commandments: the true work of faith. The love of God does, indeed, actually consist in keeping His commandments (and none can complain that they are tyrannical, vexatious, or capricious). The very object of the divine birth is the conquest of all that is opposed to God and to His commandments, and the instrument of the conquest is faith. There can be no victory over these elements that are opposed to God, and, consequently, no pure, true, God-like love, except through faith.<p>(8 b<span class= "ital">.</span>) Having left the discussion about the effect of faith on love with the same thought which began it--belief in Jesus Christ--he is led to state the grounds on which that faith rests. These are here stated to be three: water, or Christ's baptism, symbolising the complete fulfilment of the Law in His own perfect purity, and thus appealing to the Old Testament; blood, or His meritorious cross and passion, symbolising His own special work of atonement and reconciliation; and the Spirit, embracing all those demonstrable proofs of His kingdom which were from day to day forcing themselves on the attention of believers. If we accept human testimony on proper grounds, far more should we receive this divine testimony of God to His Son--the witness of the Old Testament, of the work of Christ, and of the Spirit. This witness is not far to seek, for it is actually within the true believer.<p>(8 <span class= "ital">c.</span>) The contents of the record which God has thus given us are at once most simple and most comprehensive: the gift of eternal life in His Son. The presence of the Word of God in the heart is the sole condition of life.<p>(8 <span class= "ital">a.</span>) (1) <span class= "bld">Whosoever believeth . . .</span>--What may be the works of God among those who have not heard of His Son we do not here inquire. Enough that those who have this privilege are sons if they accept the message.<p><span class= "bld">Begotten.</span>--Of those who have the new birth, in a general sense: quite distinct from "only-begotten."<p>(2) <span class= "bld">By this we know . . .</span>--Love and obedience to God will assure us of the truth of our love to others. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1John 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?">1John 4:20-21</a>, obedience to God and love to our fellows were the signs of knowledge of God and love to Him. The two are really inseparable. If love of God is absent, then our love of our fellows is not genuine--is earthly, is a mockery. If love of our fellows is absent, then we have no love for God. All friendship must be tested by loyalty to God; all love to Him must be tested by charity.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">For this is . . .</span>--These words are introduced to show that what were treated as two separate qualities in the last verse are in reality the same thing.<p><span class= "bld">And his commandments are not grievous.</span>--A transitional thought, introduced for encouragement, and forming a bridge to the next statement. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-30.htm" title="For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.">Matthew 11:30</a>.) God has commanded us nothing for His own sake, but everything for our own highest profit and happiness. Were we perfect, we should not find them commands at all, for they would be our natural impulses. The more sincerely we serve God, the more enjoyment we shall derive from them. Only to those whose inclinations are distorted, perverted, and corrupted by sin can God's laws seem irksome.<p>(4) The difficulty experienced by some in keeping God's commands arises from the influence of all that is opposed to Him in our surroundings. But he who is born of God--the true child of God--fights with this only as a conqueror, because, as far as he is born again, God is in him. God overcame the world in Christ, and is still ever conquering through Him in His sons: so that to such the commands are congenial. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1John 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm" title="You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.">1John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm" title="These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.">John 16:33</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And this is</span> <span class= "bld">the victory . . .</span>--A new thought, suitable to the tenor of the passage, which lays down that faith is the measure of love. As the conquest that is overcoming the world is wrought by human instruments, its agent may be regarded as our faith, which appropriates Christ's work, and carries it out for Him and through Him. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning.

If there be any besides the disciples of Jesus who have vanquished all that is opposed to God, where are they? God has declared that He will not harshly judge the Pagan world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>); but salvation by uncovenanted mercies is a very different thing from the glories of the illuminated and victorious Christian heart. Where are they? Not Socrates, with his want of the sense of sin and his tolerance of evil; not Cicero, with his tormenting vanity; not the Gnostics, with their questionable lives: only those in whom had dawned the bright and morning Star.<p>(8 b.) (6) <span class= "bld">This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ.</span>--"Water" and "blood" are referred to as two of the three great witnesses, or sets of evidence, for Christ. They are symbols, and look back to two of the most characteristic and significant acts of His personal history. The one is His baptism, the other His cross. Why His baptism? The baptism of John was the seal of the Law. It was the outward sign by which those who repented at his preaching showed their determination to keep the Law no longer in the letter only, but also in the spirit. Jesus, too, showed this determination. Baptism in water was His outward sign and seal to the Old Testament: that He had not come to destroy but to fulfil the Law; not to supersede the prophecies, but to claim them. It was to show that in Him the righteousness and purification which the Law intended was to be a reality, and through Him to be the law of His kingdom. Thus it pointed to all the evidence which the Old Testament could possibly afford Him; and, through the Old Testament, it pointed to the dispensation of the Father. Thus, when this most symbolic act was complete, the Almighty Giver of the old Law or covenant was heard saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."<p>"Blood." in the same way, refers to the special work of Christ Himself--the work of reconciliation and atonement by His death and passion, the realisation of all that the sacrifices and types of the former state of religion had meant. That He was the true sacrifice was proved by the perfection of His life, by the signs and wonders with which He had attracted and convinced His followers, by the fulfilment of prophecy, by the marvels of His teaching, by the amazing events which had happened at the different crises of His life, by His resurrection and ascension, and by the confession of all who knew Him well that He was the Word made flesh, full of grace and truth, and with the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father.<p><span class= "bld">Not by water only.</span>--John the Baptist might have been said to come by water only: he came preaching the washing away of the personal results of sin through turning again to the truth and spirit of the Law; Jesus came by blood also, for His sacrifice atoned for sin as rebellion against God.<p><span class= "bld">And it is the Spirit that beareth witness.</span>--The Holy Spirit had descended on Jesus at His baptism, had proved Him to be the Son of God in every word and act of His life, had raised Him up on the third day, and glorified His body till it could no longer be seen on earth. He had made new men of His disciples on the Day of Pentecost, had laid far and wide the foundations of the new kingdom, and was daily demonstrating Himself in the renewed life in all parts of the world. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-32.htm" title="And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.">John 1:32-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm" title="For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.">John 3:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Because the Spirit is truth.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the truth</span>; the sum and substance of God's revelation in all its fulness, regarded as personally proceeding from the divine throne, teaching the prophets their message, accompanying the Son on His human pilgrimage, and bringing all things afterwards to the remembrance of His disciples.<p>(7) For the reasons why this verse cannot be retained in the text, see the <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span><p>(8) The text of this verse is properly, <span class= "ital">For there are</span> <span class= "ital">three that bear witness; the Spirit, and the water, and</span> <span class= "ital">the blood.</span> It is a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.">1John 5:6</a> for the purpose of emphasis. The fact that the three that bear witness are in the masculine gender bears out the interpretation given of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.">1John 5:6</a>; that they imply the Holy Spirit, the author of the Law, and the author of Redemption. It also explains how <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm" title="For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.">1John 5:7</a> crept in as a gloss.<p><span class= "bld">And these three agree in one.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">make for the one.</span> The old dispensation, of which the Baptist's preaching was the last message, had no other moaning than the preparation for the Messiah; the sacrifice of Calvary was the consummation of the Messiah's mission; the kingdom of the Spirit, starting from that mission, was the seal of it. The three witnesses to Christ have their counterparts in the Christian soul: "baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God;" "the blood of Christ purging our conscience from dead works to serve the living God;" and "the baptism with the Holy Ghost and with fire."<p>(9) <span class= "bld">If we receive the witness of men</span>.--Any human testimony, provided it is logically binding on our understandings, to establish common facts or to prove opinions. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you.

St. John considers the threefold witness from God to convey a certainty which no human evidence could claim.<p><span class= "bld">For this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.</span>--Such witness from God there is: for this three-fold testimony is what He has said to us about His Son. If any should doubt whether the carpenter, Jesus of Nazareth, was in reality God, St. John would refer them to the righteousness and predictions of the Law and the prophets all fulfilled, to the life and death of Christ which spoke for themselves, and to manifest inauguration of the reign of the Spirit. Under these three heads would come all possible evidence for Christian truth.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself</span> .--To the real believer the three-fold testimony of God no longer remains merely an outward object of thought to be contemplated and grasped: it has become part of his own nature. The three separate messages have each produced their proper result in him, and he can no more doubt them than he can doubt himself. The water has assured him that he is no longer under the Law, but under grace, and has taught him the necessity of the new birth unto righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>). The blood has shown him that he cannot face God unless his sins are forgiven; and it has enabled him to feel that they are forgiven, that he is being daily cleansed, and that he has in himself the beginnings of eternal life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1John 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53</a>). And the Spirit, which has had part in both these, is daily making him grow in grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm" title="(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)">Ephesians 5:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He that believeth not God hath made him a liar.</span>--The negative contrast, as usual, to strengthen the affirmative. St. John regards the evidence as so certain, that he to whom it is brought and who rejects it seems as if he was boldly asserting that what God had said was false. The sceptical reply that the message did not really come from God at all it is not St. John's purpose to consider; his object is to warn his friends of the real light in which they ought to regard the opponents of the truth. There should be no complacent condoning; from the point of view of the Christians themselves, such unbelievers were throwing the truth back in God's face.<p>(8 <span class= "ital">c.</span>) <span class= "ital">What Faith contains</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.">1John 5:11-12</a>).<p>(11) <span class= "bld">This is the record.</span>--This is the substance of the witness of God. The Christian creed is here reduced to a very small compass: the gift of eternal life and the dependence of that life upon His Son. Eternal life does not here mean the mere continuance of life after death, whether for good or evil; it is the expression used throughout St. John's writings for that life in God, thought of without reference to time, which can have no end, which implies heaven and every possible variety of blessedness, and which consists in believing in God the Father and in His Son. Its opposite is not annihilation, but the second death: existence in exclusion from God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-25.htm" title="And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life.">1John 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2Timothy 1:10</a>.)<p>(12) <span class= "bld">He that hath the Son hath life.</span>--The emphatic word here is "hath." As this sentence is addressed to the faithful, there is no need to say "the Son of God." "Having the Son" is His dwelling in the heart by faith: a conscious difference to human life which transforms its whole character. "Having life" is the birth of the new man within which can never die.<p><span class= "bld">He that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</span>--As this is contemplating unbelievers, the words "of God" are added, to show them what they have lost.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - Faith is the source of love. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The verse is a sorites.

The same Holy Spirit that taught the love, will have taught obedience also; and that man cannot truly love the children of God, who, by habit, commits sin or neglects known duty. As God's commands are holy, just, and good rules of liberty and happiness, so those who are born of God and love him, do not count them grievous, but lament that they cannot serve him more perfectly. Self-denial is required, but true Christians have a principle which carries them above all hinderances. Though the conflict often is sharp, and the regenerate may be cast down, yet he will rise up and renew his combat with resolution. But all, except believers in Christ, are enslaved in some respect or other, to the customs, opinions, or interests of the world. Faith is the cause of victory, the means, the instrument, the spiritual armour by which we overcome. In and by faith we cleave to Christ, in contempt of, and in opposition to the world. Faith sanctifies the heart, and purifies it from those sensual lusts by which the world obtains sway and dominion over souls. It has the indwelling Spirit of grace, which is greater than he who dwells in the world. The real Christian overcomes the world by faith; he sees, in and by the life and conduct of the Lord Jesus on earth, that this world is to be renounced and overcome. He cannot be satisfied with this world, but looks beyond it, and is still tending, striving, and pressing toward heaven. We must all, after Christ's example, overcome the world, or it will overcome us to our ruin.</body></html>
