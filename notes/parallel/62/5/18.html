Each begins with "We know."<p>(18) <span class= "bld">Sinneth not.</span>--There is no reason to supply "unto death." (Comp. the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1John 3:9</a>.) St. John means strongly to insist, in this the solemn close of his Letter, that the true ideal Christian frame is the absence of wilful sin. Stumbles there may be, even such as need the prayers of friends, but intentional lawlessness there cannot be.<p><span class= "bld">But he that is begotten of God keepeth himself.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">he that is begotten of God keepeth him</span>: that is, the Son of God preserves him. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-15.htm" title="I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.">John 17:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And that wicked one toucheth him not.</span>--The last mention of the devil was in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1John 3:10</a>.

This spiritual faculty of discernment was one of the gifts of that Spirit which Christ was to send. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1John 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1John 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Him that is true.</span>--The personality of God. Amid all the deceptions and fluctuations of the world, St. John felt, with the most absolute and penetrating and thankful conviction, that the followers of Christ were rooted and grounded in perfect, unshakable, unassailable truth. This could not be unless they were resting on the living Son and holding fast to Him.<p><span class= "bld">This is the true God, and eternal life.</span>--A most solemn and emphatic crown to the whole Epistle. "This God, <span class= "ital">as seen in His Son, </span>is the true God." If the Word had not been God, God could not have been seen in Him. "And God, seen in His Son, is eternal life." This is only another way of putting <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.">1John 5:11-13</a>.) To make "this is the true God" refer only to the Son is equally admissible by grammar, but hardly suits the argument so well.<p>(4) LAST WARNING (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm" title="Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.">1John 5:21</a>).<p>(21) <span class= "bld">Little children, keep yourselves from idols.</span>--This parting word is suggested by the thought of "the true God." Every scheme of thought, every object of affection, which is not of Him, is a rival of His empire, a false god, a delusive appearance only, without solidity or truth. We cannot conclude better than in the words of Ebrard: "This idea is a general and very comprehensive one: it embraces all things and everything which may be opposed to the God revealed in Christ and to His worship in spirit and in truth. Pre-eminently, therefore, it embraces the delusive and vain idols of the Corinthian Gnosticism, whether ancient or modern; but it includes also the idols and false mediators of superstition, to whom the confidence is transferred which is due only to God in Christ--be their name Madonna, or saints, or Pope, or priesthood, or good works, or pictures, or office, or church, or sacraments. The One Being in whom we have 'the life eternal' is <span class= "ital">Christ. . . .</span> And this Christ we possess through the <span class= "ital">Spirit of God, </span>whose marks and tokens are not priestly vestments, but faith and love. In this meaning, the Apostle's cry sounds forth through all the ages, in the ears of all Christians, 'LITTLE CHILDREN, KEEP YOURSELVES FROM IDOLS!' The holiest things may become a snare if their letter is regarded and not their spirit. Every Christian Church has a tendency to worship its own brazen serpents. Happy are they who have a Hezekiah to call them Nehushtan!"<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-21.</span> - With three solemn asseverations and one equally solemn charge the Epistle is brought to a close. "Can we be certain of any principles in ethics? St. John declares that we can. He says that he has not been making probable guesses about the grounds of human actions, the relations of man to God, the nature of God himself. These are firings that he <span class="accented">knows.</span> Nay, he is not content with claiming this knowledge himself. He uses the plural pronoun; he declares that his disciples, his little children, <span class="accented">know</span> that which he knows" (Maurice). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We know;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2, 14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>, which should be compared with this passage. These expressions of Christian certitude explain the undialectical character of St. John's Epistles as compared with those of St. Paul. What need to argue and prove when both he and his readers already knew and believed? We must have <span class="accented">"begotten"</span> in both clauses, as in the Revised Version, not <span class="accented">"born"</span> in one and <span class="accented">"begotten"</span> in the other, as in the Authorized Version. In the Greek there is a change of tense <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, but no change of verb. The whole should run, "We know that whosoever is <span class="cmt_word">begotten</span> of God sinneth not, but <span class="cmt_word">the Begotten</span> of God keepeth <span class="cmt_word">him</span>." For the perfect participle, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6, 8</a>: it expresses him who has come to be, and still continues to be, a son of God. The aorist participle occurs nowhere else in St. John: it expresses him who, without relation to time past or present, is the Son of God. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is preferable to <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">conservat eum</span>, not <span class="accented">conserver seipsum</span>, which Calvin adopts. The eternal Son of the Father preserves the frail children of the Father from the common foe, so that <span class="cmt_word">the evil one</span> toucheth them not. The verb for "touch <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is the same as in "Touch me not" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). In both cases "touch" is somewhat too weak a rendering; the meaning is rather, "lay hold of," "hold fast." The Magdalene wished, not merely to touch, but to hold the Lord fast, so as to have his bodily presence continually. And here the meaning is that, though the evil one may attack the children of God, yet he cannot get them into his power. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:18-21 All mankind are divided into two parties or dominions; that which belongs to God, and that which belongs to the wicked one. True believers belong to God: they are of God, and from him, and to him, and for him; while the rest, by far the greater number, are in the power of the wicked one; they do his works, and support his cause. This general declaration includes all unbelievers, whatever their profession, station, or situation, or by whatever name they may be called. The Son leads believers to the Father, and they are in the love and favour of both; in union with both, by the indwelling and working of the Holy Spirit. Happy are those to whom it is given to know that the Son of God is come, and to have a heart to trust in and rely on him that is true! May this be our privilege; we shall thus be kept from all idols and false doctrines, and from the idolatrous love of worldly objects, and be kept by the power of God, through faith, unto eternal salvation. To this living and true God, be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</body></html>
