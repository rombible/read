Amen.">1John 5:21</a>).]<p>St. John, thinking perhaps of the close of his Gospel, where he states the same purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-31.htm" title="But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.">John 20:31</a>), and reminded by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.">1John 5:11</a> of the supreme importance of having eternal life, and of the necessity of finding this in the Son, sums up the object of his Letter in these two ideas. He tells his friends again that he writes to them because they believe on the name of the Son of God, and explains his wish to be that, by the thoughts which he has put before them, they may feel certain that the eternal life which ought to be theirs is theirs already, and that their belief may not cease, but may be really vital. Thinking then of those who would be deceiving themselves if they pretended to any such hopeful assurance, he reminds the faithful of the power of prayer. Beginning with the general statement that confidence in God means that He hears us, he goes on to show that hearing must imply that our petitions are granted; and next, that it would be a petition quite in accordance with God's will, and therefore likely to be heard, if a believer were to pray for a sinning brother. At the same time it must be recollected that there is such a state of wilful, hard-hearted rebellion that it is past praying for. Meantime they must remember again that as far as they were born of God they could not wilfully sin; that if they were what St. John thought them they had ample proofs that they were of God, and must not forget that the whole world was corrupted; and that there could not be any doubt that the Son of God was come, and had given them the spiritual sense necessary to discerning the true God. In that true God they were, through His Son. The God of whom the Son had spoken was that true God, and to know Him as such in His Son was eternal life. The last request was, that they should strictly guard themselves against any appearance or tendency whatsoever which might claim their sympathy or allegiance apart from God.<p>(1) FRESH STATEMENT OF PURPOSE (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1John 5:13</a>).<p>(13) Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-31.htm" title="But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.">John 20:31</a>. The expression here is more positive than in the Gospel: there, "that ye might believe, and that believing ye might have life;" here, "that ye may know that ye have." He wishes to produce in them a good hope. The specific object at the beginning of the Epistle was the communication of joy through fellowship with the Apostles the knowledge of possessing eternal life and the continuance of their faith would be precisely that joy.<p>(2) WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT COME UP TO THE STANDARD ASSUMED (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-14.htm" title="And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:">1John 5:14-17</a>).<p>(14) <span class= "bld">And this is the confidence.--</span>The assurance intended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1John 5:13</a> implies confidence, and confidence means the conviction that God is not deaf to our prayers. But these must not be contrary to His will. The Lord's Prayer reminds us that the Person referred to here is the Father.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">That we have the petitions.</span>--The goodness of God as Light and Love is so fully established that if our petitions are according to His will it follows necessarily that He grants them.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death.</span>--Here are meant such stumblings as do not imply any distinct, wilful, deliberate severance from the faith of Christ. To divide sins, on the authority of this passage, into venial and mortal is to misunderstand the whole argument of the Epistle and to seduce the conscience. St. John only means that though prayer can do much for an erring brother, there is a wilfulness against which it would be powerless: for even prayer is not stronger than freewill. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1John 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-31.htm" title="And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:">Luke 22:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-9.htm" title="I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you have given me; for they are yours.">John 17:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And he shall give.</span>--The interceding Christian is regarded as gaining life for the erring brother and handing it on to him.<p><span class= "bld">There is a sin unto death.</span>--The limit of intercession is now given: such conscious and determined sin as shows a loss of all hold on Christ. Such a state would be a sign of spiritual death. Hardened obstinacy would be invincible; and as it would not be according to the will of God that prayers, by the nature of the case in vain, should be offered to Him, St. John thinks that intercession ought to stop here. At the same time, he is careful not categorically to forbid it; he only says that in such cases he does not recommend intercessory prayer. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-31.htm" title="Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.">Matthew 12:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-29.htm" title="But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.">Mark 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm" title="For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,">Hebrews 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm" title="If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.">Hebrews 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-26.htm" title="For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,">Hebrews 10:26-27</a>.) "His brother" is here, of course, a nominal Christian.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">All unrighteousness is sin.</span>--Here St. John reminds them that all Christians might, at one time or another, stand in need of intercessory prayer, even those who, on the whole, might be considered as "sinning not" (because their permanent will was against sin, and for holiness), because every declension from the perfect righteousness of God is error or sin. Nothing that was not hopelessly deliberate need be considered a sign of absolute spiritual death. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm" title="Whoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.">1John 3:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-21.</span> - 4. CONCLUSION OF EPISTLE; without, however, any marked break between this section and the last On the contrary, the prominent thought of <span class="accented">eternal life through faith in the Son of God</span> is continued for final development. This topic is the main idea alike of the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>) and of the Epistle, with this difference - in the Gospel the purpose is that we may <span class="accented">have</span> eternal life; in the Epistle, that we may <span class="accented">know</span> that we have eternal life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things I have written to you</span> sums up the Epistle as a whole. At the outset the apostle said, "These things we write, that our joy [yours as well as mine] may be fulfilled;" and now, as he draws to a close, he says the same thing in other words. Their joy is the knowledge that they have eternal life through belief in the Son of God. There is considerable variety of reading in this verse, but that of the T.R., represented by the Authorized Version, is a manifest simplification. That represented by the Revised Version is probably right. The awkwardness of the last clause produced various alterations with a view to greater smoothness. The verse, both as regards construction and meaning, should be carefully compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>. In both we have the epexegetic addition at the end. In both we have St. John's favourite <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, expressing the very strongest belief; motion to and repose upon the object of belief. In both we have the remarkable expression, "believe on his <span class="accented">Name."</span> This is no mere periphrasis for "believe on him." Names in Jewish history were so often significant, being sometimes given by God himself, that they served not merely to distinguish one man from another, but to indicate his character. So also with the Divine Name: it suggests the Divine attributes. "To believe on the Name of the Son of God" is to give entire adhesion to him as having the qualities of the Divine Son. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:13-17 Upon all this evidence, it is but right that we believe on the name of the Son of God. Believers have eternal life in the covenant of the gospel. Then let us thankfully receive the record of Scripture. Always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord. The Lord Christ invites us to come to him in all circumstances, with our supplications and requests, notwithstanding the sin that besets us. Our prayers must always be offered in submission to the will of God. In some things they are speedily answered; in others they are granted in the best manner, though not as requested. We ought to pray for others, as well as for ourselves. There are sins that war against spiritual life in the soul, and the life above. We cannot pray that the sins of the impenitent and unbelieving should, while they are such, be forgiven them; or that mercy, which supposes the forgiveness of sins, should be granted to them, while they wilfully continue such. But we may pray for their repentance, for their being enriched with faith in Christ, and thereupon for all other saving mercies. We should pray for others, as well as for ourselves, beseeching the Lord to pardon and recover the fallen, as well as to relieve the tempted and afflicted. And let us be truly thankful that no sin, of which any one truly repents, is unto death.</body></html>
