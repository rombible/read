He then restates the motive in a new form both positively and negatively. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Little children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> being spurious). This address, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>, introduces the summing up of the section. It may be doubted whether the absence of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> with the first pair <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> and its presence with the second <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> indicates any marked difference, as if <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> expressed the instrument, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> the element or sphere. This introduces a false antithesis, like "Do not dig with a stick, but dig in the earth." (For the Hebraic <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> to express the instrument, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-10.htm">Revelation 13:10</a>.) "Nor yet with the tongue" is not a tautological addition. One may love in <span class="accented">word</span> only, and yet the affectionate words may be quite sincere; and this is a common case. People say kind things which they mean at the moment, but afterwards they do not take the trouble to act kindly. But to love <span class="accented">with the tongue</span> only is far worse. This is to say kind things which one does not mean, and which one knows to be unreal. Deeds are needed to complete the kind word; truth is needed to correct the insincere tongue. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-21 Here is the condescension, the miracle, the mystery of Divine love, that God would redeem the church with his own blood. Surely we should love those whom God has loved, and so loved. The Holy Spirit, grieved at selfishness, will leave the selfish heart without comfort, and full of darkness and terror. By what can it be known that a man has a true sense of the love of Christ for perishing sinners, or that the love of God has been planted in his heart by the Holy Spirit, if the love of the world and its good overcomes the feelings of compassion to a perishing brother? Every instance of this selfishness must weaken the evidences of a man's conversion; when habitual and allowed, it must decide against him. If conscience condemn us in known sin, or the neglect of known duty, God does so too. Let conscience therefore be well-informed, be heard, and diligently attended to.</body></html>
