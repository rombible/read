We can believe a document (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>), or a statement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a>), or a person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37, 38</a>); but how can we believe a name? By believing those truths which the name implies: in the present case by believing that Jesus is the Saviour, is the Messiah, is the Son of God. To produce this belief and its consequence, eternal life, is the purpose of St. John's Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>); it is also the will of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>), and the command of his Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>). This belief will inevitably produce as its fruit that we "love one another [present tense of what is habitual], even as Christ gave us commandment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12, 17</a>). Throughout the Epistle, and especially in this passage (verses 22-24), the references to Christ's farewell discourses in the Gospel are frequent. Here the main ideas of those discourses are represented - obedience to the Divine commands, particularly as to faith and love; promised answer to prayer, abiding in God; the gift of the Spirit (see on 1 John 4:5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-24 When believers had confidence towards God, through the Spirit of adoption, and by faith in the great High Priest, they might ask what they would of their reconciled Father. They would receive it, if good for them. And as good-will to men was proclaimed from heaven, so good-will to men, particularly to the brethren, must be in the hearts of those who go to God and heaven. He who thus follows Christ, dwells in Him as his ark, refuge, and rest, and in the Father through him. This union between Christ and the souls of believers, is by the Spirit he has given them. A man may believe that God is gracious before he knows it; yet when faith has laid hold on the promises, it sets reason to work. This Spirit of God works a change; in all true Christians it changes from the power of Satan to the power of God. Consider, believer, how it changes thy heart. Dost not thou long for peace with God? Wouldst thou not forego all the world for it? No profit, pleasure, or preferment shall hinder thee from following Christ. This salvation is built upon Divine testimony, even the Spirit of God.</body></html>
