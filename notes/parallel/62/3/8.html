The devil <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the great <span class="accented">accuser</span> or <span class="accented">slanderer, as</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1.htm">Job 1</a> and 2 (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2, 10</a>). The devil sinneth from the beginning <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. From the beginning of what? From the beginning of sin. The devil was the first sinner, and has never ceased to sin. Other answers are: from the beginning <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the devil, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of the creation, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of human history. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some of these are scarcely in harmony with Scripture; none, perhaps, fit the context so well as the explanation adopted. If the devil committed the first sin, and has sinned unceasingly ever since, then whoever sins is akin to him, is morally his offspring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). There is the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the evil one, and man cannot find or make a third domain; if he is not in the one he is in the other. This verse, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, seems to be conclusive as to the personal existence of the devil. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> balances <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: if the one is a mere personification of a tendency, why not the other? Both should be personal or neither. "It is not true that St. John speaks so confidently of a devil because he was a Jew and was filled with Hebrew opinions. For once that the devil is introduced in the Law, the Psalms, and the Prophets, he is spoken of twenty times in any Gospel or Epistle" (Maurice), and not least in the Gentile Luke. With the latter half of verse 8. comp, verse 5. Christ's act in removing our sins from us destroys the devil's works; for by the manifestation of the Light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>) the darkness is dispersed and destroyed. Our sins are the evil one's works: what is sin in us is his natural occupation. (For <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of unbinding or dissolving, and therefore destroying - a use specially frequent in St. John - comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-23.htm">John 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>.) The <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> includes the whole work of Christ on earth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:3-10 The sons of God know that their Lord is of purer eyes than to allow any thing unholy and impure to dwell with him. It is the hope of hypocrites, not of the sons of God, that makes allowance for gratifying impure desires and lusts. May we be followers of him as his dear children, thus show our sense of his unspeakable mercy, and express that obedient, grateful, humble mind which becomes us. Sin is the rejecting the Divine law. In him, that is, in Christ, was no sin. All the sinless weaknesses that were consequences of the fall, he took; that is, all those infirmities of mind or body which subject man to suffering, and expose him to temptation. But our moral infirmities, our proneness to sin, he had not. He that abides in Christ, continues not in the practice of sin. Renouncing sin is the great proof of spiritual union with, continuance in, and saving knowledge of the Lord Christ. Beware of self-deceit. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, and to be a follower of Christ, shows an interest by faith in his obedience and sufferings. But a man cannot act like the devil, and at the same time be a disciple of Christ Jesus. Let us not serve or indulge what the Son of God came to destroy. To be born of God is to be inwardly renewed by the power of the Spirit of God. Renewing grace is an abiding principle. Religion is not an art, a matter of dexterity and skill, but a new nature. And the regenerate person cannot sin as he did before he was born of God, and as others do who are not born again. There is that light in his mind, which shows him the evil and malignity of sin. There is that bias upon his heart, which disposes him to loathe and hate sin. There is the spiritual principle that opposes sinful acts. And there is repentance for sin, if committed. It goes against him to sin with forethought. The children of God and the children of the devil have their distinct characters. The seed of the serpent are known by neglect of religion, and by their hating real Christians. He only is righteous before God, as a justified believer, who is taught and disposed to righteousness by the Holy Spirit. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. May all professors of the gospel lay these truths to heart, and try themselves by them.</body></html>
