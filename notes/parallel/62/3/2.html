Again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27, 29</a>), we are in doubt about the construction. What is the nominative to "shall be manifested" <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>, "he" or "it"? The context is strongly in favour of "it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "if it shall be manifested <span class="accented">what we shall be</span>;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a> seems to favour "he," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "if <span class="accented">Christ</span> shall be manifested." The context must prevail. "Our future state is not yet made manifest. We know that on its manifestation we shall find ourselves like God." The two things will be contemporaneous. The 'Speaker's Commentary' quotes the following anecdote: "When some heathen converts to Christianity were translating a Catechism into their own language, they came upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>. They stopped. 'No; it is too much,' they said; 'let us write that we shall be permitted to kiss his feet.'" Beware of inverting the meaning of the last clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>. It does not mean that the seeing God is a <span class="accented">proof</span> or <span class="accented">sign</span> of our being like him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>), but the <span class="accented">cause</span> of our being like him: "We shall be like him, <span class="accented">because we</span> shall see him." God is light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), and light is <span class="accented">seen.</span> In this life <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> we cannot see the light of the Divine nature "as it is," but only as it is reflected; and the reflected light cannot transmit to us the nature of the Divine original, though it prepares us to receive it. Hereafter the sight, "face to face" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>), of the Light itself will illuminate us through end through, and we shall become like it. Rothe takes "like him" to mean like Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16, 17, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1,2 Little does the world know of the happiness of the real followers of Christ. Little does the world think that these poor, humble, despised ones, are favourites of God, and will dwell in heaven. Let the followers of Christ be content with hard fare here, since they are in a land of strangers, where their Lord was so badly treated before them. The sons of God must walk by faith, and live by hope. They may well wait in faith, hope, and earnest desire, for the revelation of the Lord Jesus. The sons of God will be known, and be made manifest by likeness to their Head. They shall be transformed into the same image, by their view of him.</body></html>
