The former seems better on account of verse 22; but the latter may be right (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).

Hitherto St. John has mentioned only the Father and the Son; now the Spirit also (alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20, 27</a>) is introduced by name as a witness and test of the truth. The sentence forms the transition to the subject of the next section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-6</a>), which is a sort of digression, the subject of love being mentioned in verse 7. This verse is said to have been a favourite with Spinoza. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-24 When believers had confidence towards God, through the Spirit of adoption, and by faith in the great High Priest, they might ask what they would of their reconciled Father. They would receive it, if good for them. And as good-will to men was proclaimed from heaven, so good-will to men, particularly to the brethren, must be in the hearts of those who go to God and heaven. He who thus follows Christ, dwells in Him as his ark, refuge, and rest, and in the Father through him. This union between Christ and the souls of believers, is by the Spirit he has given them. A man may believe that God is gracious before he knows it; yet when faith has laid hold on the promises, it sets reason to work. This Spirit of God works a change; in all true Christians it changes from the power of Satan to the power of God. Consider, believer, how it changes thy heart. Dost not thou long for peace with God? Wouldst thou not forego all the world for it? No profit, pleasure, or preferment shall hinder thee from following Christ. This salvation is built upon Divine testimony, even the Spirit of God.</body></html>
