"And the goal of this love <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is that once for all (aorist) we have received the title 'children of God.'" And, whatever cavilers may say, the title is rightfully ours. (The words, "and (such) we are," are quite rightly inserted in the Revised Version after "children of God.") This is shown by the fact that the world does not recognize us as such, because from the first it did not recognize God. Had it known the Father, it would have known the children, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in St. John refers to what precedes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-16.htm">John 5:16, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-22.htm">John 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-18.htm">John 12:18, 27, 39</a>); it does not merely anticipate the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> which follows it. In logical phraseology we have here first the major premise, then the conclusion introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, then (to clench the argument) the minor premise introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <TAB>We are children of God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Therefore</span><TAB>the world knows us not; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">For</span><TAB>the world knows not God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But we must beware of supposing that every one who fails to recognize <span class="accented">our form</span> of Christianity is necessarily of the world. St. John invariably (but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-7.htm">Revelation 21:7</a>) speaks of "children of God" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, St. Paul generally of "sons of God", <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x2e;</span> The latter expression can apply to <span class="accented">adopted</span> sons; the former, strictly speaking, implies actual parentage. In saying <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, St. John appeals to the conscious nobility of Christians: we have this magnificent title with its corresponding dignity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1,2 Little does the world know of the happiness of the real followers of Christ. Little does the world think that these poor, humble, despised ones, are favourites of God, and will dwell in heaven. Let the followers of Christ be content with hard fare here, since they are in a land of strangers, where their Lord was so badly treated before them. The sons of God must walk by faith, and live by hope. They may well wait in faith, hope, and earnest desire, for the revelation of the Lord Jesus. The sons of God will be known, and be made manifest by likeness to their Head. They shall be transformed into the same image, by their view of him.</body></html>
