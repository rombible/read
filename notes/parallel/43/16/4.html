He strengthens them by forewarning them. When the persecution comes they will remember His word, and find in it support for their faith and evidence of His presence with them.<p><span class= "bld">These things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</span>--While with them, He would spare them, and it was against Himself that the hatred of His foes was directed. When He shall have left them they will represent Him, and must stand in the foreground of the battle.<p>These words seem to be opposed to Matthew 10 and parallel passages, where our Lord did tell the Apostles at the time of their call of the persecutions which awaited them. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-17.htm" title="Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said to us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?">John 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm" title="A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.">John 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-28.htm" title="I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.">John 16:28</a>.) The passages are not, however, really inconsistent, for "these things" in this verse (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm" title="And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.">John 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-1.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that you should not be offended.">John 16:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-21.htm" title="But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.">John 15:21</a>) refers to the full account He has given them of the world's hatred and the principles lying at the foot of it, and the manner in which it was to be met by the Spirit's witness and their witness of Him. These things which the infant Church would have to meet, and meet without His bodily presence, He told them not at the beginning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> - the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> suggests a kind of pause, as if he had said, "I will go into no further details" (Meyer) - <span class="cmt_word">these things</span> - these prophecies of approaching persecution - <span class="cmt_word">I have spoken to you, that</span> (here <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> has its proper relic force) <span class="cmt_word">when</span> [<span class="cmt_word">their</span>] <span class="cmt_word">hour is come, ye may remember</span> [<span class="cmt_word">them</span>] <span class="cmt_word">how that I told you</span>. This awkward form is that due to the perplexities of the position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in the text. Frequently our Lord thus prepared his disciples for the future, called upon them to remember his predictions as pledges of his Divine mission, but still more as consolations and supply of strength when they would most of all need it. <span class="cmt_word">These things I told you not from the beginning</span>; not "at the beginning," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;</span>, nor <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-21.htm">Isaiah 40:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a>), from the beginning of my ministry (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>), and continuously throughout it. If "these things" are restricted to the prediction of cruel persecution, they are certainly contradicted by the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17, 21, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>, etc.; Matthew 21:36; 24:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>, etc. The numerous explanations of the commentators, that Christ had now given a more detailed, particular, and tragic outlook, cannot be sustained. Nor does the supposition that John is here the corrector of the synoptic narrative satisfy (Meyer); nor that of Godet, that Matthew, in his tenth chapter, was gathering together all that Christ had said of this nature, antedating instructions that the Lord had given, at all explain the corresponding passages in Luke's Gospel. The language of the last clause, because <span class="cmt_word">I was with you</span>, throws more light upon it. This does not surely mean "because I was bearing for you the brunt of the opposition," - it would be unnecessary altogether to say that. All along <span class="accented">they</span> must have bitterly felt the antagonism which their Lord encountered. The difficulty is removed by including in the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of Ver. 4 what certainly is involved in the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of Ver. 1; and the reference is to the whole of his instructions touching his departure and the coming of the other Paraclete, and the principle from which the hatred of the world would spring; the explanation of the anticipated hostility which he had now offered, and the way in which they might overcome it. So long as he was with them they could not be made to understand the Divine riches of the consolation which was now so near. From the beginning he had not given all this class of instruction, because he was with them. While at their side, it was premature to speak of the special help they would require in their bereaved condition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-6 Our Lord Jesus, by giving his disciples notice of trouble, designed that the terror might not be a surprise to them. It is possible for those who are real enemies to God's service, to pretend zeal for it. This does not lessen the sin of the persecutors; villanies will never be changed by putting the name of God to them. As Jesus in his sufferings, so his followers in theirs, should look to the fulfilling of Scripture. He did not tell them sooner, because he was with them to teach, guide, and comfort them; they needed not then this promise of the Holy Spirit's presence. It will silence us to ask, Whence troubles come? It will satisfy us to ask, Whither go they? for we know they work for good. It is the common fault and folly of melancholy Christians to look only on the dark side of the cloud, and to turn a deaf ear to the voice of joy and gladness. That which filled the disciples' hearts with sorrow, was too great affection for this present life. Nothing more hinders our joy in God, than the love of the world, and the sorrow of the world which comes from it.</body></html>
