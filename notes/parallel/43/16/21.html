This figure was of frequent use in the prophets. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm" title="Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold on me, as the pangs of a woman that travails: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.">Isaiah 21:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/26-17.htm" title="Like as a woman with child, that draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and cries out in her pangs; so have we been in your sight, O LORD.">Isaiah 26:17-18</a>, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/66-7.htm" title="Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.">Isaiah 66:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-31.htm" title="For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that mourns herself, that spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.">Jeremiah 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm" title="O inhabitant of Lebanon, that make your nest in the cedars, how gracious shall you be when pangs come on you, the pain as of a woman in travail!">Jeremiah 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-6.htm" title="Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child? why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?">Jeremiah 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/13-13.htm" title="The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come on him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.">Hosea 13:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/4-9.htm" title="Now why do you cry out aloud? is there no king in you? is your counselor perished? for pangs have taken you as a woman in travail.">Micah 4:9-10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That a man is born into the world.</span>--The word is the wider word for "human being."

The thought is of the joy of maternity swallowing up the pangs of child-birth. These cease to exist, but that continues.

Meyer and others rebel against any meaning beyond that of the following of joy upon sorrow; but Tholuck, De Wette, Ebrard, and Moulton see here the obvious reference to those "travail-pangs of death" with which St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-24.htm">Acts 3:24</a>) said that the Holy One could not be restrained, agonies in which for a while every apostle must have wept and lamented, dying and being crucified with him, and to the glorious deliverance of all who suffered with him, when they live again in newness of life by the power of his resurrection. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:16-22 It is good to consider how near our seasons of grace are to an end, that we may be quickened to improve them. But the sorrows of the disciples would soon be turned into joy; as those of a mother, at the sight of her infant. The Holy Spirit would be their Comforter, and neither men nor devils, neither sufferings in life nor in death, would ever deprive them of their joy. Believers have joy or sorrow, according to their sight of Christ, and the tokens of his presence. Sorrow is coming on the ungodly, which nothing can lessen; the believer is an heir to joy which no one can take away. Where now is the joy of the murderers of our Lord, and the sorrow of his friends?</body></html>
