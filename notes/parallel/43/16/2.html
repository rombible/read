The word rendered "service" means the service of worship. This will be seen by a comparison of the other instances where it occurs in the New Testament--they are <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6</a>. A Rabbinic comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-13.htm" title="And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.">Numbers 25:13</a>, is, "Whosoever sheddeth the blood of the wicked is as he who offereth sacrifice." The martyrdom of Stephen, or St. Paul's account of himself as a persecutor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-9.htm" title="I truly thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.">Acts 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/1-13.htm" title="For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:">Galatians 1:13-14</a>), shows how these words were fulfilled in the first years of the Church's history, and such accounts are not absent from that history's latest page.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They</span> (used impersonally, as the German <span class="accented">man</span>, or the French <span class="accented">ou</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall make</span> (or, <span class="accented">declare</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>you excommunicate</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> "put you out of the synagogue," expel you from the fellowship of your country's worship (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a> and John 12:42) - <span class="cmt_word">nay, further</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> abruptly introduces a very much stronger assertion) <span class="cmt_word">an hour cometh, that</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is here, by Meyer and many others, said to involve a Divine order, purpose, or destiny, intended by the drawing on of the foreordained crisis; but it seems enough to convey by it the contemplated result (see Canon Evans, <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, 1882) - <span class="cmt_word">whosoever killeth you will deem that he is offering service</span> - sacrificial homage - to God (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; both these words are persistently used with this meaning. See, for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-4.htm">Matthew 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>). The well-known quotation from 'Bammidbar Rabba,' fol. 329. 1, "Every one shedding the blood of the wicked is equal to him who offers sacrifice," may throw light on the expression. The intensity of the fanaticism was well exhibited in the persecution in which Stephen fell, and which St. Paul deemed worthy service, and one which he ought to have rendered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-9.htm">Acts 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13, 14</a>). The curse was long and deep and tragic, and Christ explains it by the awful reiteration, <span class="cmt_word">These things will they do</span> <span class="cmt_word">because they have not known the Father, nor me</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a>, etc.). He reiterates the explanation already given of the manner and form as well as the fact of the world's hatred. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-6 Our Lord Jesus, by giving his disciples notice of trouble, designed that the terror might not be a surprise to them. It is possible for those who are real enemies to God's service, to pretend zeal for it. This does not lessen the sin of the persecutors; villanies will never be changed by putting the name of God to them. As Jesus in his sufferings, so his followers in theirs, should look to the fulfilling of Scripture. He did not tell them sooner, because he was with them to teach, guide, and comfort them; they needed not then this promise of the Holy Spirit's presence. It will silence us to ask, Whence troubles come? It will satisfy us to ask, Whither go they? for we know they work for good. It is the common fault and folly of melancholy Christians to look only on the dark side of the cloud, and to turn a deaf ear to the voice of joy and gladness. That which filled the disciples' hearts with sorrow, was too great affection for this present life. Nothing more hinders our joy in God, than the love of the world, and the sorrow of the world which comes from it.</body></html>
