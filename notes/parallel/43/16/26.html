Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-23.htm" title="And in that day you shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.">John 16:23-24</a>. When guided by the Paraclete, the life will be subject to the will of Christ, and the prayer will be in His name.<p><span class= "bld">And I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you.</span>--These words have often been taken to mean, "That I will pray the Father for you, is a matter of course, of which I need not tell you; but this sense is excluded by the following verse. The thought is rather, "I do not speak of praying for you, because in the presence of the Advocate you will yourselves be able to pray in My name to the Father." His prayer is thought of as not necessary for them, and yet the form of the words implies that He will pray for them if it should be needed. While their hearts are the temples of the Holy Ghost, and they maintain communion with the Father, they will need no other Advocate, but "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1John 2:1</a>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-9.htm" title="I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you have given me; for they are yours.">John 17:9</a>, which refer to the time which precedes the gift of the Holy Ghost.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span> - pointing to "the hour" of these open declarations - <span class="cmt_word">ye shall ask</span> (<span class="accented">make petitions</span>, not ask or demand of me, in the tone of equality) <span class="cmt_word">in my Name</span>. The opportunity will come when all my Name will be appreciated by you, and your spiritual reception of me will teach you to approach the Father, who is thus revealed to you. Calvin in these verses calls attention to the familiarity of Israel with the idea of a Mediator, one by whom they drew near to God, and that Christ places himself here in the stead of the whole propitiatory service and ritual of the temple. "His Name" was the Divine equivalent of all the work of the high priest from one Day of Atonement to another and for evermore. <span class="cmt_word">And I do not say to you, that I will make my request to the Father concerning you</span> (see note on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, Ver. 23, etc.). It will not do to argue, with Grotius, that this is just as if he had said, "To say nothing of my own intercessions for you," or, "You may take these for granted;" because the very next verse gives his reason for the assertion. Nor is it satisfactory to say, with Meyer, that the "prayers" of which he speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9, 20</a>) are <span class="accented">before</span> the gift of the Paraclete, and not inconsistent with the higher condition of the disciples after the Paraclete should have been given; because John had received the Paraclete when he wrote, "We have an Advocate with the Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>). Nor can we suppose that the great utterances of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-25.htm">Hebrews 9:25</a> are vain imaginations, and that there is no sense in which the Lord does augment and complete our prayers, taking them upon his heart and going in his high-priestly prerogative into the holy place with his own blood; but the words must nevertheless be pressed, and their meaning held to be compatible with what Paul and John say of the" intercession of Christ." They reveal the perfect access to the Father's heart which he has secured for his disciples, the full reconciliation effected as well as devised and consummated by the Father's own love (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>, "By Christ we both [Jew and Gentile] have access (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) in one <span class="accented">spirit to the Father"</span>). The end of the whole ministry of Christ is, in the power of the Holy Ghost's revelation of him, to bring men to the Father and let them know it. There is no need that Christ should (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) make special prayer to the Father, as though he were merciful and the Father needed to be appeased towards those for whom he had prepared so great a salvation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>, where Philippi, Calvin, and others show that Christ's <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is the effect of his own glorious and eternal work). His appearance in the presence of God for us is the perpetual pledge of the completeness of his sacrifice. These very passages in Hebrews and Romans have to be interpreted in harmony with this great statement of his own, viz. that there is no reason to ask the Father concerning them; all has been asked and answered, the intercession is complete; his whole work will have reconciled the Father with his children, and that by reason of the Father's own love. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:23-27 Asking of the Father shows a sense of spiritual wants, and a desire of spiritual blessings, with conviction that they are to be had from God only. Asking in Christ's name, is acknowledging our unworthiness to receive any favours from God, and shows full dependence upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness. Our Lord had hitherto spoken in short and weighty sentences, or in parables, the import of which the disciples did not fully understand, but after his resurrection he intended plainly to teach them such things as related to the Father and the way to him, through his intercession. And the frequency with which our Lord enforces offering up petitions in his name, shows that the great end of the mediation of Christ is to impress us with a deep sense of our sinfulness, and of the merit and power of his death, whereby we have access to God. And let us ever remember, that to address the Father in the name of Christ, or to address the Son as God dwelling in human nature, and reconciling the world to himself, are the same, as the Father and Son are one.</body></html>
