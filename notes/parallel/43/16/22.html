Their sorrow would be but temporary; their joy would be abiding. The point of comparison between their state, and the familiar illustration of a woman in travail, is the passage from extreme suffering to extreme joy. We are not justified in taking the illustration as a parable, and interpreting it of the death of Christ as the birth-pang of a perfect humanity. This is the general interpretation of the more mystical expositors, and has been unfolded with great truth and beauty; but it is not an exposition of the present text.<p><span class= "bld">But I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice.</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-19.htm" title="Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me?">John 16:19</a> He had said "Ye shall see." This is the obverse of the same truth. He will again. be with them, and see them as they will see Him. The words include too the thought of His deep sympathy with them. He sees them now in the depth of their sorrow, and feels with them in that. He will see them again in the time of their joy, and will rejoice with them in that.<p><span class= "bld">And your joy no man taketh from you.</span>--The reading is doubtful. Some of the better MSS. have the future ". . . shall take from you." "No man" is better rendered indefinitely, <span class= "ital">no one,</span> as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.">John 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-29.htm" title="My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.">John 10:29</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38-39</a>, and Notes there.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span>, so he continues, <span class="cmt_word">ye therefore</span> <span class="cmt_word">indeed now have sorrow</span> - your hearts are troubled, you weep and lament to-night, your desolation for "a little while" will be utter collapse and dismay - <span class="cmt_word">but I shall see you again.</span> He does not repeat, "Ye shall behold me" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>), but "I shall see you (<span class="greek">&#x1f54;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>)." The same word, however, is used repeatedly in the record of the resurrection, and in Ver. 19 he had said <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>. The point of the vision is his own consciousness of their human need filling all the forty days with its glory. The occasional manifestations of his Person during that interval helped them in a wonderful way to recognize the fact that he was ever watching them, and was at their side under all the circumstances of human life. <span class="cmt_word">And your heart shall rejoice, and this joy of yours no one taketh</span> (present in the full sense of a realized future) from you. The <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> lends itself to the larger conception which, by the gift of the Holy Ghost, they at length fully apprehended, that <span class="accented">he</span> was with them always, even to the end of the world. That conviction was forced upon them before Pentecost (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>, and the account in this Gospel of the spiration and communication of the Holy Ghost, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>), before he came as the sound of a rushing mighty wind, or sat in tongues of flame on their heads. Your joy in the sense of my constant presence no one, neither man nor devil, taketh away from you. That presence will not be any further exposed to Jewish malice or treachery, nor darkened by persecution, nor destroyed by death; though with bodily eyes ye see me not, yet, fully realizing that my eye is on you, "you will rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:16-22 It is good to consider how near our seasons of grace are to an end, that we may be quickened to improve them. But the sorrows of the disciples would soon be turned into joy; as those of a mother, at the sight of her infant. The Holy Spirit would be their Comforter, and neither men nor devils, neither sufferings in life nor in death, would ever deprive them of their joy. Believers have joy or sorrow, according to their sight of Christ, and the tokens of his presence. Sorrow is coming on the ungodly, which nothing can lessen; the believer is an heir to joy which no one can take away. Where now is the joy of the murderers of our Lord, and the sorrow of his friends?</body></html>
