The ground of this saying is in the fact that the Son is the Revealer of the Father, and that the fulness of the truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>) is given unto Him. The words appear from the context not to express the spiritual relation of the Son to the Father, but the fulness of the communication to Him in His human nature of the divine truth which He should reveal to man. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.">John 8:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2-3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">He taketh of Mine, and shall declare it unto you.</span> The present expresses the unchanging relation of the Spirit to the Son. It should be noted that in these verses (14 and 15) there is an implication of the following doctrinal truths. They are implied, let us remember, in the words of our Lord Himself, and that they are implied and not stated increases the force of their meaning:--(1) The divinity of the Son: "He shall glorify Me;" "All things that the Father hath are Mine." (2) The personality of the Holy Ghost: "He shall receive of Mine." The Greek word, <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>, expresses this in the most emphatic way. The word is used of the Holy Spirit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>. (3) The Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity: "the Father;" "I;" "He."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - In this verse our Lord makes a still more superlative claim. <span class="cmt_word">All things which the Father hath</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">are mine</span>. Perhaps no sentence recorded by St. John is more difficult to reconcile with the mere humanity of our Lord, even of the loftiest kind. The "mine" of the previous verse is declared to embrace something more than the mystery of his Person and sacrifice. "All that the Father hath," all his fullness of being, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, all the power, all the effulgence of the glory of the Father, of the human race, and of all things, "are mine." This makes a spiritual apprehension of Christ include a perfect revelation of all the Father's character and work. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore said</span> <span class="cmt_word">I, that he</span> (the Spirit of truth, in being your Guide into all the truth) <span class="cmt_word">taketh of mine, and will declare</span> (it) <span class="cmt_word">unto you</span>. Because "mine is the Father's, and the Father's is mine;" because, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he is the Center, and Agent, and Motive, and Force in all the Divine self-revelation, and because he possessed as his own this vast range, this infinite fullness of Divine operations, he promised them this spiritual teaching, and assured them that his highest glory was simply to be made known as he is. Calvin, "We see how the greater part of men deceive themselves; for they pass by Christ, and go out of the way to seek God by circuitous paths." In these verses we have a very abundant exhibition of the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, coupled with a very remarkable setting forth of the tri-personality. The Father "hath" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) that which is in very. essence the Son's (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>); and the Spirit, whose purpose is to glorify the Son by making him known to men (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), takes of "mine" and will declare it (see Stier, Schaff, note to Lange). Luthardt once thought with Stier, but now limits the reference, without giving any reason for it, to what he calls "the deposit of Divine truth in the humanity of Jesus." The sum of this astonishing assurance is that the Holy Spirit of truth, an essential element if not Personality in the Godhead, will lead these apostles into the fullness of truth, and of knowledge of the future, by taking up the essential realities of the Christ in the fullness of his being and work, and disclosing them by spiritual insight and supernatural quickening. These realities of the Christ will prove to be the fullness of the Father's heart - all that the Father hath. Again we ask - Does St. John even here travel beyond his prologue? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:7-15 Christ's departure was necessary to the Comforter's coming. Sending the Spirit was to be the fruit of Christ's death, which was his going away. His bodily presence could be only in one place at one time, but his Spirit is every where, in all places, at all times, wherever two or three are gathered together in his name. See here the office of the Spirit, first to reprove, or to convince. Convincing work is the Spirit's work; he can do it effectually, and none but he. It is the method the Holy Spirit takes, first to convince, and then to comfort. The Spirit shall convince the world, of sin; not merely tell them of it. The Spirit convinces of the fact of sin; of the fault of sin; of the folly of sin; of the filth of sin, that by it we are become hateful to God; of the fountain of sin, the corrupt nature; and lastly, of the fruit of sin, that the end thereof is death. The Holy Spirit proves that all the world is guilty before God. He convinces the world of righteousness; that Jesus of Nazareth was Christ the righteous. Also, of Christ's righteousness, imparted to us for justification and salvation. He will show them where it is to be had, and how they may be accepted as righteous in God's sight. Christ's ascension proves the ransom was accepted, and the righteousness finished, through which believers were to be justified. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. All will be well, when his power is broken, who made all the mischief. As Satan is subdued by Christ, this gives us confidence, for no other power can stand before him. And of the day of judgment. The coming of the Spirit would be of unspeakable advantage to the disciples. The Holy Spirit is our Guide, not only to show us the way, but to go with us by continued aids and influences. To be led into a truth is more than barely to know it; it is not only to have the notion of it in our heads, but the relish, and savour, and power of it in our hearts. He shall teach all truth, and keep back nothing profitable, for he will show things to come. All the gifts and graces of the Spirit, all the preaching, and all the writing of the apostles, under the influence of the Spirit, all the tongues, and miracles, were to glorify Christ. It behoves every one to ask, whether the Holy Spirit has begun a good work in his heart? Without clear discovery of our guilt and danger, we never shall understand the value of Christ's salvation; but when brought to know ourselves aright, we begin to see the value of the Redeemer. We should have fuller views of the Redeemer, and more lively affections to him, if we more prayed for, and depended on the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
