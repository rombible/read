In the world, indeed, tribulation, but this as conquered in Him, and not interrupting the true peace in Him." The thought is closely allied to that of the last verse, "Alone and not alone;" "Troubled, and yet having peace." He had spoken of this from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-1.htm" title="Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in me.">John 14:1</a> onwards, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm" title="If the world hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.">John 15:18</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-4.htm" title="But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not to you at the beginning, because I was with you.">John 16:4</a> specially of the tribulation which awaited them. (Comp. St. Paul's experience of these contrasts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;">2Corinthians 4:8</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">That in me ye might have peace.</span>--Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.">John 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-7.htm" title="If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you.">John 15:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">In the world ye shall have tribulation.</span>--The reading of the better MSS. is, "In the world ye have tribulation." It is the general statement of their relation to the world. The two clauses answer to each other--the one defining the origin of their inner, the other of their outer life. The life in the world is but the life as it is seen by others; the true life is that which is in communion with God through Christ, and that is one of never-failing peace, which no tribulation can ever affect. Peace is the Christian's birthright, and his joy no one taketh from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-22.htm" title="And you now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you.">John 16:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.">John 14:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">But be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.</span>--The pronoun is strongly emphatic, "<span class= "ital">I</span> have Myself overcome the world." He speaks of the assured victory as though it were already accomplished. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm" title="Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.">John 16:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-31.htm" title="Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.">John 13:31</a>.) Here is the reason why they should take courage and be of food cheer. He is the Captain of their salvation, and has already won the victory. The enemies they fear, the world in which they have tribulation, are already captives following in the Conqueror's train. They themselves have pledges of victory in and through His victory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things have I spoken</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>; all the farewell discourses. The tone of these last triumphant words reminds them of the finest and noblest of his previous assurances, his promises of peace, courage, and victory over all the evil and power of this world) <span class="cmt_word">to you, that in me ye might have peace</span> (see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27, 28</a>). The entire issue of the discourse is the conference on his disciples of his own secret of <span class="accented">peace - the</span> adequate support amid the crushing force and vehement hostility of the world (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2-4</a>, "Though the earth be removed.., there is a river," etc.). Peace is the balance of equilibrating forces; and man needs a Divine force behind and within him to encounter the tremendous odds arrayed against him, in mysteries of life, temptation of the devil, infirmity of the flesh, and antagonism of the world, so that we need not be surprised to hear him say, <span class="cmt_word">In the world ye have</span> <span class="cmt_word">tribulation</span>. It is the fundamental condition of Divine life in this world. Christ's disciples may take that for granted (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>), but the most striking and unique note of the true faith is that this sorrow is blended with an inward rapture which transforms it into peace. The blending of fear and love, of law with promise, of righteousness with mercy, of the sense of sin with that of pardon, of a great peace with a crushing tribulation, is one of the most constant tokens, signs, or marks of the mind of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">But be of good courage.</span> This is the practical uprising of the soul into the joy of the Lord (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 28</a>). (The word itself is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in John, though found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-49.htm">Mark 10:49</a>.) <span class="greek">&#x27;&#x391;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">I</span> - very emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">have overcome the world</span>. "A vous encore le combat, a mot des a present la victoire! Mats en mot la meme victoire a vous vous aussi" (Reuss). The royal sublimity of this last word, on the eve of the Passion, became one of the perpetually recurring thoughts of John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2, 3</a>, where the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is again and again referred to). Christ's victory already assured to him becomes theirs. So "by similar anticipation we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4</a>." The victory had been, however, already achieved over the world's temptations, and over the bitterness of internal treachery, and the vast sum of human ingratitude; and this may in part explain the use of the perfect tense, "I have overcome." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:28-33 Here is a plain declaration of Christ's coming from the Father, and his return to him. The Redeemer, in his entrance, was God manifest in the flesh, and in his departure was received up into glory. By this saying the disciples improved in knowledge. Also in faith; Now are we sure. Alas! they knew not their own weakness. The Divine nature did not desert the human nature, but supported it, and put comfort and value into Christ's sufferings. And while we have God's favourable presence, we are happy, and ought to be easy, though all the world forsake us. Peace in Christ is the only true peace, in him alone believers have it. Through him we have peace with God, and so in him we have peace in our own minds. We ought to be encouraged, because Christ has overcome the world before us. But while we think we stand, let us take heed lest we fall. We know not how we should act if brought into temptation; let us watch and pray without ceasing, that we may not be left to ourselves.</body></html>
