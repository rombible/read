The introduction of the thought again here reminds us that, although in the fulness of the higher spiritual life there is communion between the Father and the human spirit, because the Father Himself ever loveth the heart which can receive His love, this power to receive the love of the Father is itself the result of loving the Son, who has revealed Him. Our Lord is leading them to the fuller truths of spiritual communion with God, and even tells them that this will be independent of mediation; but the very words which tell them that it will be independent of mediation, tell them that all depends upon His own mediation and the manifestation of the love of God in His own person.<p><span class= "bld">And have believed that I came out from God.</span>--The reading is uncertain. Several of the better MSS. read, ". . . that I came forth from the Father." (Comp. the first words of the next verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-3.htm" title="Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;">John 13:3</a>.) The perfect tenses represent their love and faith as completed, and continuing in the present. It is striking that the order of the words makes faith' follow love. This order may be chosen to mark emphatically the connection between the Father's love for the disciples and their love for the Son; but it also suggests that their convictions were the result of having their hearts opened by love so that they received the truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Father himself loveth you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), with love of a fatherly affection, such as mine to you, <span class="cmt_word">because ye have loved me</span> (the perfect preterit, in the sense of the realized past in the present which shall then be), and have believed that I came forth from <span class="accented">the side of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the Father</span>. In their belief of this transcendent fact is the hope of the world. It was wrought in them by the strengthening pulses of a deepening love, and to this love God himself responds with a personal tender affection that encourages boundless prayer. The disciple and lover of Jesus, having Jesus in the heart, united to him by living faith, will find in Christ that there is a perpetual pledge of reciprocal love between the Father and himself. Christ will not (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) ask the Father, because his entire position as Mediator establishes a continual appeal, is a perpetual <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, a continuous drawing near and appeal to God on our account, a pledge and guarantee of our own fellowship with and access to the Father. Our English word "intercession," though apparently corresponding with the Latin and with the Greek word, does not now represent its original meaning. That meaning is by no means equivalent to the hind of prayer which is here excluded (Trench, 'Syn. N.T.,' &sect; 51.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:23-27 Asking of the Father shows a sense of spiritual wants, and a desire of spiritual blessings, with conviction that they are to be had from God only. Asking in Christ's name, is acknowledging our unworthiness to receive any favours from God, and shows full dependence upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness. Our Lord had hitherto spoken in short and weighty sentences, or in parables, the import of which the disciples did not fully understand, but after his resurrection he intended plainly to teach them such things as related to the Father and the way to him, through his intercession. And the frequency with which our Lord enforces offering up petitions in his name, shows that the great end of the mediation of Christ is to impress us with a deep sense of our sinfulness, and of the merit and power of his death, whereby we have access to God. And let us ever remember, that to address the Father in the name of Christ, or to address the Son as God dwelling in human nature, and reconciling the world to himself, are the same, as the Father and Son are one.</body></html>
