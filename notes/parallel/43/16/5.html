The work of His apostleship on earth was drawing to its close, and He was about to return to the Father from whom He had received it. This was to Him matter of joy, and if they had really loved Him would have been so to them. They would have thought of the future before Him, as He was then thinking, in the fulness of His love, of the future before them.<p><span class= "bld">And none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</span>--Peter had asked this very question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-36.htm" title="Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where go you? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.">John 13:36</a>), and Thomas had implied it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-5.htm" title="Thomas said to him, Lord, we know not where you go; and how can we know the way?">John 14:5</a>), but what the words here mean is, "None of you are out of love for Me asking about the place whither I am going. Your thoughts are not with Me. It is to you as nothing that I am returning to Him that sent Me."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> - at this very moment - <span class="cmt_word">I go away to him that sent me</span>. I have completed his work, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? This seems at variance with Peter's inquiry, "<span class="cmt_word">Whither goest thou</span>?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-36.htm">John 13:36</a>), and with Thomas's question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-5.htm">John 14:5</a>), "We know not whither thou goest," etc.? yet they are only opposed in appearance. Peter's question had obviously turned the whole matter back upon himself, and the way in which the Lord's departure affected his own duties and position; and the same may be said of Thomas. They had both lost sight of the "whither" in the pain and anguish of the departure. Our Lord had great difficulty in inducing them to realize the blessedness that would befall themselves from his own exaltation, and even now, after all that he had said about this great power and glory which awaited him, he added, <span class="cmt_word">Because I have spoken these things to you</span> - since all along you are taking the dark side, and looking on the anguish of my departure and desolateness of your own condition, instead of the grandeur of the new kingdom and dispensation of which you will be witnesses and organs - <span class="cmt_word">sorrow hath filled your heart</span>; the one heart which I throughout have been seeking to comfort. You are not looking on the <span class="accented">end</span> of my departure, or on the fullness of my glory, or on the addition to your own blessedness, but on your own loss, disappointment, and chagrin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-6 Our Lord Jesus, by giving his disciples notice of trouble, designed that the terror might not be a surprise to them. It is possible for those who are real enemies to God's service, to pretend zeal for it. This does not lessen the sin of the persecutors; villanies will never be changed by putting the name of God to them. As Jesus in his sufferings, so his followers in theirs, should look to the fulfilling of Scripture. He did not tell them sooner, because he was with them to teach, guide, and comfort them; they needed not then this promise of the Holy Spirit's presence. It will silence us to ask, Whence troubles come? It will satisfy us to ask, Whither go they? for we know they work for good. It is the common fault and folly of melancholy Christians to look only on the dark side of the cloud, and to turn a deaf ear to the voice of joy and gladness. That which filled the disciples' hearts with sorrow, was too great affection for this present life. Nothing more hinders our joy in God, than the love of the world, and the sorrow of the world which comes from it.</body></html>
