Heaven, and not earth, is My home. I leave the world again and return to the Father." They had accepted the truth of the Incarnation, but in this there was already implied the truth of the Ascension, and in the truth of the Ascension there was implied the gift of the Paraclete, and the spiritual return and constant presence of Christ in the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-14.htm" title="If you shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.">John 14:14-18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - In these words our Lord gathers sublimely up a record of his entire self-manifestation. <span class="cmt_word">I came forth out of the Father</span> (where <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>, is the new and better reading), as from the Divine Source of my pre-existent glory, <span class="cmt_word">I have come into the world</span>, incarnate in humanity, "the Word was made flesh," "the Light lighting every man has come into the world." <span class="cmt_word">Again, I am leaving the world</span> behind me, though for a little while you may behold me, <span class="cmt_word">and I am going</span> on a great mission, with a goal in view, <span class="cmt_word">to the Father</span>. "Recapitulationem maximam habet hic versus" (Bengel). Christ had said all this before, but they have never seen it as a whole. The several parts had been so impressive, that the whole truth had been concealed from them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:28-33 Here is a plain declaration of Christ's coming from the Father, and his return to him. The Redeemer, in his entrance, was God manifest in the flesh, and in his departure was received up into glory. By this saying the disciples improved in knowledge. Also in faith; Now are we sure. Alas! they knew not their own weakness. The Divine nature did not desert the human nature, but supported it, and put comfort and value into Christ's sufferings. And while we have God's favourable presence, we are happy, and ought to be easy, though all the world forsake us. Peace in Christ is the only true peace, in him alone believers have it. Through him we have peace with God, and so in him we have peace in our own minds. We ought to be encouraged, because Christ has overcome the world before us. But while we think we stand, let us take heed lest we fall. We know not how we should act if brought into temptation; let us watch and pray without ceasing, that we may not be left to ourselves.</body></html>
