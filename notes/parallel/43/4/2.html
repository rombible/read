The form of the report is quite natural. John did personally baptise, and when multitudes thronged him, it is probable that his disciples assisted. Greater numbers still (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-26.htm" title="And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.">John 3:26</a>) were thronging to the baptism administered ministerially by the disciples of Jesus. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-48.htm" title="And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.">Acts 10:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-5.htm" title="When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.">Acts 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.">1Corinthians 1:15-17</a>.) They had been drawn to Him by His teaching and miracles in Jerusalem and the country round about, and they spoke of receiving His baptism. But the writer cannot let the report appear in his Gospel without correction. There was a reason which they did not know for the fact that Jesus did not baptise with water, for it was He "which baptiseth with the Holy Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>). and this power His disciples had not yet received (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-3 Jesus applied himself more to preaching, which was the more excellent, 1Co 1:17, than to baptism. He would put honour upon his disciples, by employing them to baptize. He teaches us that the benefit of sacraments depends not on the hand that administers them.</body></html>
