This was the Shom?ron built by Omri, on a hill purchased from Shemer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/16-23.htm" title="In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.">1Kings 16:23-24</a>). The city was given by Augustus to Herod the Great, who rebuilt it, and called it after the Emperor, Sebaste, a name which survives in the modern village <span class= "ital">Sebustieh.</span><p><span class= "bld">Sychar</span> involves questions of greater uncertainty. The reading may be regarded as beyond doubt, the attempts to substitute "Sychem," or "Sichem" being obviously made to avoid the topographical difficulty. The older geographers, followed by many modern commentators, suppose the word to be an intentional variation of the word Sychem, by which the Jews expressed their contempt for the city of the Samaritans, the sound being very nearly that of the Hebrew words for "lie" and "drunken." Others suppose the change of termination is a natural dialectic variation. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Ben,</span> the Hebrew for son, as in <span class= "ital">Benjamin,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.">Genesis 35:18</a>, which in the later language became <span class= "ital">Bar,</span> as in Simon <span class= "ital">Bar-</span>Jona, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>.) These explanations assume that Sychar is the same place as Shechem; but it is very improbable that St. John would have spoken of a city so well known as Shechem with the prefix "which is called," or would have thought it necessary to define it as "near to the parcel of ground. . . ." The only other places with the same prefix are Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm" title="Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.">John 11:54</a>), the Pavement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-13.htm" title="When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.">John 19:13</a>), and Golgotha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-17.htm" title="And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:">John 19:17</a>), but in the latter instances, as in the mention of Thomas called Didymus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-16.htm" title="Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.">John 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-24.htm" title="But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.">John 20:24</a>), the words do not imply a soubriquet (comp. Farrar, <span class= "ital">Life of Christ,</span> i. 206, note, and Grove in Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of Bible,</span> "Sychar"), but are a citation of the names in Hebrew and Greek, for the benefit of Greek readers. To assert that Sychar is meant to convey a double meaning is to imply that this would be understood by readers for whom it is necessary to translate Gabbatha and Golgotha, Thomas and Cephas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-42.htm" title="And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.">John 1:42</a>), for whom Messias has been rendered in Greek in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>, and is to be again in this very discourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a>). Shechem, moreover, was then known by the Greek name Neapolis, which has become the present <span class= "ital">Napl-s</span> (see Ewald <span class= "ital">in loc.,</span> and comp. Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iv.), and this name would have been as natural in this Gospel as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> Tiberias, which is found in it only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.">John 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-23.htm" title="(However, there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)">John 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.">John 21:1</a>). Nor can it be said that Shechem was near to Jacob's well, for admitting that the old city extended considerably "farther eastward than at present," it must still have been more than a mile distant.<p>As early as the fourth century, Sychar was distinguished from Shechem by Eusebius, Jerome, and the Bordeaux Pilgrim, and the name also occurs in the Talmud. (See quotations in Wieseler's <span class= "ital">Synopsis,</span> p. 231 of the Eng. Trans.) It is still found in the modern village <span class= "ital">Askar,</span> about half a mile north from Jacob's well. A plan and description of the neighbourhood, by Dr. Rosen, Prussian Consul at Jerusalem, appeared in the <span class= "ital">Journal of the German Oriental Society</span> (xiv. 634), and the results of this are now accessible to the English reader in the translation of Caspari's <span class= "ital">Introduction</span> (p. 124). (Comp. Dr. Thomson's <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book,</span> John 31) The identification is accepted by Ewald, Godet, and Luthardt, among modern writers. Mr. Grove (Art. "Sychar," as above), inclines to it, but, as he says, "there is an etymological difficulty . . . 'Askar begins with the letter 'Ain, which Sychar does not appear to have contained; a letter too stubborn and enduring to be easily either dropped or assumed in a name." One is tempted to think it possible that this 'Ain is the first letter of the word for Spring or Fountain, the plural of which occurs in 'non, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-23.htm" title="And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.">John 3:23</a>, and that <span class= "ital">'A-Sychar</span> (well of Sychar) = <span class= "ital">'Askar.</span><p><span class= "bld">The parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span>--The reference is to the blessing of Joseph in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm" title="Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.">Genesis 48:22</a>, which is translated by Kalisch, "And I give to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I take out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow." The patriarch is confident that he will, in his posterity, drive out the Amorite and possess the land promised him by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-4.htm" title="And he must needs go through Samaria.">John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a>). In that land there is a portion where Abraham had raised his first altar, and received the first promise that his seed should possess that land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6-7</a>). That portion had been his own first halting-place on his return from Padan-aram; and he, too, had erected an altar there, in a parcel of a field where his tent rested, which he bought for a hundred pieces of money, and made it sacred to El, the God of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/33-18.htm" title="And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.">Genesis 33:18-20</a>). It comes to his mind now, when in the last days of his life he looks on to the future and back to the past, and he gives it to his own and Rachel's son. The Hebrew word here used for portion is "Shechem" (Shekhem), and this, as the proper names in the following chapter, has, and is meant to have, a double meaning. The Greek of the LXX. could not preserve this play upon the words, and rendered it by the proper name <span class= "ital">Sikima,</span> understanding that the portion referred to was that at Shechem. This the children of Israel understood too, for they gave this region to Ephraim (Joshua 16), and the parcel of ground became the resting-place for the bones of Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32-33</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, called Sychar</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>, with all the principal uncials; not <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>, as read by the Elzevir edition of Stephens, with one cursive, 69); not "the city" Shechem - the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm">Acts 7:16</a>, or <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of Josephus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a>) - not Sebaste (Samaria), but "a city," one of the cities requiring special designation beyond its mere name, which would hardly have been necessary, if so renowned a spot as the metropolis of the ancient kingdom, or the ancient patriarchal city of Shechem or Sychem, had been thought cf. The similarity of the names Sychar and Sichem led many to suppose that John confounded either the names or the places. Those who were anxious to undervalue the accuracy of the author have attributed it to mistake. Schenkel still sees the error of a Gentile Christian. Others have supposed that the word meaning "town of drunkards" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>), or "town of liars" <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>), was intentionally applied by John to <span class="accented">Shechem</span>, or that some provincial pronunciation of the name of the old city had thus been commemorated. Hengstenberg suggested that Sychar was a suburb of Siehem or Shechem, and Robinson placed the latter much nearer to Jacob's welt than the present <span class="accented">Nablous.</span> Tholuck gave a philosophical solution - that <span class="accented">m</span> and <span class="accented">r</span> in the two words, being <span class="accented">liquids</span>, were interchanged; and Meyer at one time held that John simply applied the vulgar name. Jerome ('Quaest. Web. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>.') said it was a corruption of the name Sichem. But Eusebius discriminated Shechem from Sychar in his 'Onomasticon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>; and a place called <span class="accented">Sochar</span> or <span class="accented">Sichra</span> is mentioned, and also its "well," in the Talmud. Delitzsch ('Zeitsehrift flit Luth. Theol.,' 1856) has quoted seven passages which refer to the place as the birthplace of rabbis, and as having been alternately occupied by Jews and Samaritans. Moreover, in late years, Palestine explorers have found, within <span class="accented">half a mile</span> of Jacob's well, a village, <span class="accented">El</span> '<span class="accented">Askar</span>, preserving to the present day the old name. Nor has the name been in late years drawn from this narrative and given to this insignificant village, for a Samaritan chronicle, dating from the twelfth century, preserves the name as <span class="accented">Iskar. A priori</span> it is far more probable that a woman of Sychar, than one of Shechem, should have come to draw water, in consequence of the nearer proximity of the former "city" than of the latter to Jacob's well. It is further characterized <span class="cmt_word">as near to the parcel of ground</span> <span class="cmt_word">which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> (LXX.); <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, we see that Jacob's treaty with the sons of Humor, and the summary violence of his sons in punishment of Dinah's dishonour, were treated by him as giving him special possession in Shechem (the LXX., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>, have translated the word for "portion," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, erroneously supposing that the word was a proper name, instead of an allusive play on the word "Shechem"), and he solemnly bequeathed it to Joseph. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a> we find the bones of Joseph were deposited there. (Knobel translates <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> as the portion which he, Jacob, (by his sons) <span class="accented">would</span> win (not had won) with sword and bow.) Geiger, 'Urschrift.,' p. 80 (referred to by Edersheim<span class="accented">, i.e.</span>, 1:404), shows that St. John's interpretation of Genesis is perfectly in harmony with rabbinic tradition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:4-26 There was great hatred between the Samaritans and the Jews. Christ's road from Judea to Galilee lay through Samaria. We should not go into places of temptation but when we needs must; and then must not dwell in them, but hasten through them. We have here our Lord Jesus under the common fatigue of travellers. Thus we see that he was truly a man. Toil came in with sin; therefore Christ, having made himself a curse for us, submitted to it. Also, he was a poor man, and went all his journeys on foot. Being wearied, he sat thus on the well; he had no couch to rest upon. He sat thus, as people wearied with travelling sit. Surely, we ought readily to submit to be like the Son of God in such things as these. Christ asked a woman for water. She was surprised because he did not show the anger of his own nation against the Samaritans. Moderate men of all sides are men wondered at. Christ took the occasion to teach her Divine things: he converted this woman, by showing her ignorance and sinfulness, and her need of a Saviour. By this living water is meant the Spirit. Under this comparison the blessing of the Messiah had been promised in the Old Testament. The graces of the Spirit, and his comforts, satisfy the thirsting soul, that knows its own nature and necessity. What Jesus spake figuratively, she took literally. Christ shows that the water of Jacob's well yielded a very short satisfaction. Of whatever waters of comfort we drink, we shall thirst again. But whoever partakes of the Spirit of grace, and the comforts of the gospel, shall never want that which will abundantly satisfy his soul. Carnal hearts look no higher than carnal ends. Give it me, saith she, not that I may have everlasting life, which Christ proposed, but that I come not hither to draw. The carnal mind is very ingenious in shifting off convictions, and keeping them from fastening. But how closely our Lord Jesus brings home the conviction to her conscience! He severely reproved her present state of life. The woman acknowledged Christ to be a prophet. The power of his word in searching the heart, and convincing the conscience of secret things, is a proof of Divine authority. It should cool our contests, to think that the things we are striving about are passing away. The object of worship will continue still the same, God, as a Father; but an end shall be put to all differences about the place of worship. Reason teaches us to consult decency and convenience in the places of our worship; but religion gives no preference to one place above another, in respect of holiness and approval with God. The Jews were certainly in the right. Those who by the Scriptures have obtained some knowledge of God, know whom they worship. The word of salvation was of the Jews. It came to other nations through them. Christ justly preferred the Jewish worship before the Samaritan, yet here he speaks of the former as soon to be done away. God was about to be revealed as the Father of all believers in every nation. The spirit or the soul of man, as influenced by the Holy Spirit, must worship God, and have communion with him. Spiritual affections, as shown in fervent prayers, supplications, and thanksgivings, form the worship of an upright heart, in which God delights and is glorified. The woman was disposed to leave the matter undecided, till the coming of the Messiah. But Christ told her, I that speak to thee, am He. She was an alien and a hostile Samaritan, merely speaking to her was thought to disgrace our Lord Jesus. Yet to this woman did our Lord reveal himself more fully than as yet he had done to any of his disciples. No past sins can bar our acceptance with him, if we humble ourselves before him, believing in him as the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</body></html>
