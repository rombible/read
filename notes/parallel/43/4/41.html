We know how much was said at the well in a few minutes, and that many believed on Him in a few hours. What questions they must have asked! What truths He must have taught during this sojourn! How that central truth of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man must have burned in the hearts of this mixed and despised people! Salvation was of the Jews, and they were from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim. But Fatherhood is a truth for every heart of man, and He who thus linked heaven and earth was the Saviour of the world. We know not what words passed from them to Him, from Him to them; but we know that the result was that many more believed, and that those who before believed on testimony passed to the higher faith of personal conviction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41, 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And very many more believed,</span> during that visit, <span class="cmt_word">by reason of his word</span> - Christ's own word. We know not what the word was, but the specimens which John has recorded make us certain that torrents of living water flowed from his lips. He was moving in the full power of the Spirit. He was unveiling the nature of that "salvation" which was, as he said, "from the Jews;" but a salvation which affected and was adapted to the whole world. <span class="cmt_word">And they</span> (<span class="accented">repeatedly</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>said to the woman</span> (the play of aorist and imperfect tenses throughout this passage is very noteworthy), <span class="cmt_word">No longer do we believe by reason of thy speaking</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> does not generally connote so serious a meaning as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The first word is used for "utterance" pure and simple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>), and for the inarticulate voices of lower creatures as well, while <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> never have the latter meaning; but still <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> is used in classical Greek for "discourse," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-43.htm">John 8:43</a> is used by Christ of his own "utterance." Meyer says the term is purposely chosen from the standpoint of the <span class="accented">speaker</span>, while in ver. 39 <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used of the same <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> by St. John as narrator. The above are the only times the term is found in the New Testament. <span class="cmt_word">For we have ourselves heard, and we know</span> - fully, by personal intuition (we might have expected <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> here) - <span class="cmt_word">that</span> <span class="cmt_word">this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</span> This sublime description only occurs in one other place in the New Testament (viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-14.htm">1 John 4:14</a>), and here it falls from the lips of a Samaritan. There is no improbability that it should have expressed the thought of Samaritans, for they entertained wider and less nationalized views than did the Jews. Baur's notion, that the author wished to contrast heathen or Gentile susceptibility with Jewish narrowness and reserve, is out of keeping with the facts. A genuine heathen would have been as easy to <span class="accented">invent</span> as a susceptible Samaritan. "The Saviour of the world" is one of the noblest and most accurate terms in all the Bible to denote the work of Christ. It is the outcome of a discourse and of teaching which led men to the idea of spiritual and sincere worship of the Father, which searched for moral conditions rather than orthodox ritual, which demanded purity of life more than outward observance, and treated doing the will and work of the Father as more indispensable than necessary food. We need not be surprised (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>.) to find the outcome of this sojourn of the Divine Lord among the misunderstood and hated Samaritans. The effort of the Tubingen school to find in this narrative an idealization of the synoptic tradition of Christ's special beneficence towards the Samaritans is very unfortunate, because, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5</a>, the "twelve" were forbidden to enter into cities of the Samaritans, and advised to occupy all their energies in evangelizing the cities of Israel. The record of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>. affords very slender basis for a corresponding enlargement. The narrative before us shows that, in answer to the receptivity of the Samaritans, the Lord made the richest and fullest and most explicit and immediate revelation of himself. The extension of the kingdom of grace to Samaritans, and their incorporation into the body of Christ, was arrested by the need of the visit of the apostles, by the magic and hypocrisy of Simon; of which there is not here the slightest trace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:27-42 The disciples wondered that Christ talked thus with a Samaritan. Yet they knew it was for some good reason, and for some good end. Thus when particular difficulties occur in the word and providence of God, it is good to satisfy ourselves that all is well that Jesus Christ says and does. Two things affected the woman. The extent of his knowledge. Christ knows all the thoughts, words, and actions, of all the children of men. And the power of his word. He told her secret sins with power. She fastened upon that part of Christ's discourse, many would think she would have been most shy of repeating; but the knowledge of Christ, into which we are led by conviction of sin, is most likely to be sound and saving. They came to him: those who would know Christ, must meet him where he records his name. Our Master has left us an example, that we may learn to do the will of God as he did; with diligence, as those that make a business of it; with delight and pleasure in it. Christ compares his work to harvest-work. The harvest is appointed and looked for before it comes; so was the gospel. Harvest-time is busy time; all must be then at work. Harvest-time is a short time, and harvest-work must be done then, or not at all; so the time of the gospel is a season, which if once past, cannot be recalled. God sometimes uses very weak and unlikely instruments for beginning and carrying on a good work. Our Saviour, by teaching one poor woman, spread knowledge to a whole town. Blessed are those who are not offended at Christ. Those taught of God, are truly desirous to learn more. It adds much to the praise of our love to Christ and his word, if it conquers prejudices. Their faith grew. In the matter of it: they believed him to be the Saviour, not only of the Jews but of the world. In the certainty of it: we know that this is indeed the Christ. And in the ground of it, for we have heard him ourselves.</body></html>
