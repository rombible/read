Its omission is due to a difficulty of interpretation. What is the previous return into Galilee? The only one mentioned in this Gospel is that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm" title="The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.">John 1:43</a>. We have had another note of time in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-24.htm" title="For John was not yet cast into prison.">John 3:24</a>, from which we learn that this Judaean period of the ministry preceded the imprisonment of John, and therefore the commencement of the Galilean ministry recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm" title="Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;">Matthew 4:12</a> (see Note there) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-14.htm" title="Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,">Mark 1:14</a>. This second return, then, is the starting-point of the history of our Lord's work in Galilee as told by the earlier Gospels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee</span>. But it should be observed that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> is a very peculiar word for a simple departure. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> is used when <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> might have been expected (Westcott). The word means "to leave a thing to itself," to its own ways, to treat it as no longer exercising an influence on the mind. (It is, with the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, used for "forgive," "forgiveness," of sins.) Jesus left Judaea, which had so imperfectly accepted his claims. The word suggests that his departure was a consequence of the action of the Pharisees; <span class="accented">And he departed again.</span> This refers to the first departure after the early testimonies of John, when Jesus went to Cana and Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>). Whether this journey corresponded with that mentioned in Matthew and Mark, as following the baptism and temptation of Jesus, or not, it is not to be confounded with the journey which John had already recorded. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-3 Jesus applied himself more to preaching, which was the more excellent, 1Co 1:17, than to baptism. He would put honour upon his disciples, by employing them to baptize. He teaches us that the benefit of sacraments depends not on the hand that administers them.</body></html>
