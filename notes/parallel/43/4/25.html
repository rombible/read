"Father!" "Spirit!" what did all this mean? Was God in any real sense like the father who in childhood's happy days had protected, and forgiven, and loved? Was the divine nature in any real sense approached by human nature in its highest and best moments, when it seemed lifted above earth, and things of the earth? Was there for her a Father who could still forgive, a Spirit whom her spirit could still love, and in the grasp of that love lift itself to virtue and truth? How different are His words to any she has ever heard before! She, as others, feels half unconsciously their power. Her answer is also a question. He, whom her countrymen called "The Converter," or "The Returner," and expected from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm" title="The LORD your God will raise up to you a Prophet from the middle of you, of your brothers, like to me; to him you shall listen;">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, and whom the Hebrews called "Messias," and Hellenists called "Christ," would come, and with Him the answer to every question. She uses the present tense, "Messias cometh." Can it be that He stands before her now? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-29.htm" title="Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?">John 4:29</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> <span class="accented">The Christ as conceived by Samaria.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - We probably do not possess here the whole of the conversation. It is clear, however, that strange presentiments of something more precious than any sanctuary, or any ritual, dawned upon the Samaritan woman. "A prophet" might tell her and her people <span class="accented">where</span> men ought to worship. The Prophet she discovered answered a desire for the "where" by revealing the "how" they are to worship. But there are many other lessons they need, and she gives expression to an idea of the Messiah, and of his coming, which startles us by its boldness. <span class="cmt_word">The woman saith unto him, I know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, I know as a matter of current opinion and with intuitive certainty) <span class="cmt_word">that Messias cometh</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which is called Christ</span>). [This parenthetical clause by the evangelist is the explanatory translation into Greek of the Aramaic word. This must be so, unless we could be certain, with Hug, Diodati, and Roberts, that Jesus and the woman were speaking Greek to each other.] The woman turns from a theme which she has partially understood. How should a woman have been able at a moment to discharge and dispense with the traditions of a life, and the prejudices hoary with age? We know that the Samaritans anticipated One who should be a "converter," or "restorer" (Gesenius, 'Anecdota Samaritana,' p. 65, translates the Samaritan word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> by <span class="accented">conversor</span> (so Ewald); Hengstenberg, Tholuck, Meyer, by <span class="accented">restitutor</span>), and cherished a hope of his appearance, upon the faith of the great promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>) that One would arise who would make known to them the Divine will. It is remarkable, but not unreasonable, that she should have adopted the Hebrew word in common use among all the Jewish people. In ver. 29 it is given in Greek without any reference to the original speech. Samaritans and Jews alike anticipated a <span class="accented">Christ</span> an Anointed One, a Plenipotentiary, a Guide. The more spiritual apprehension which follows becomes some explanation of the fact that our blessed Lord should have admitted to <span class="accented">her</span> what he afterwards, in Galilee, kept reticently in reserve. The Galilaeans would have come, on his slightest encouragement, and against his will have made him a king. This would have forced on him a position and dignity which, from their standpoint, would have wrecked his spiritual mission and frustrated his design. This woman, here and later on, made it obvious that her notion of the "Restitutor" or "Messiah" was One who, <span class="cmt_word">when he is come, will declare to us all things;</span> in ver. 29 One who can read the secrets of the heart, and knows her and others altogether; while from ver. 42 we learn that she and her friends were anticipating there and then "the Saviour of the world." Luthardt here points back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a> as part of the origin of the Samaritan idea. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:4-26 There was great hatred between the Samaritans and the Jews. Christ's road from Judea to Galilee lay through Samaria. We should not go into places of temptation but when we needs must; and then must not dwell in them, but hasten through them. We have here our Lord Jesus under the common fatigue of travellers. Thus we see that he was truly a man. Toil came in with sin; therefore Christ, having made himself a curse for us, submitted to it. Also, he was a poor man, and went all his journeys on foot. Being wearied, he sat thus on the well; he had no couch to rest upon. He sat thus, as people wearied with travelling sit. Surely, we ought readily to submit to be like the Son of God in such things as these. Christ asked a woman for water. She was surprised because he did not show the anger of his own nation against the Samaritans. Moderate men of all sides are men wondered at. Christ took the occasion to teach her Divine things: he converted this woman, by showing her ignorance and sinfulness, and her need of a Saviour. By this living water is meant the Spirit. Under this comparison the blessing of the Messiah had been promised in the Old Testament. The graces of the Spirit, and his comforts, satisfy the thirsting soul, that knows its own nature and necessity. What Jesus spake figuratively, she took literally. Christ shows that the water of Jacob's well yielded a very short satisfaction. Of whatever waters of comfort we drink, we shall thirst again. But whoever partakes of the Spirit of grace, and the comforts of the gospel, shall never want that which will abundantly satisfy his soul. Carnal hearts look no higher than carnal ends. Give it me, saith she, not that I may have everlasting life, which Christ proposed, but that I come not hither to draw. The carnal mind is very ingenious in shifting off convictions, and keeping them from fastening. But how closely our Lord Jesus brings home the conviction to her conscience! He severely reproved her present state of life. The woman acknowledged Christ to be a prophet. The power of his word in searching the heart, and convincing the conscience of secret things, is a proof of Divine authority. It should cool our contests, to think that the things we are striving about are passing away. The object of worship will continue still the same, God, as a Father; but an end shall be put to all differences about the place of worship. Reason teaches us to consult decency and convenience in the places of our worship; but religion gives no preference to one place above another, in respect of holiness and approval with God. The Jews were certainly in the right. Those who by the Scriptures have obtained some knowledge of God, know whom they worship. The word of salvation was of the Jews. It came to other nations through them. Christ justly preferred the Jewish worship before the Samaritan, yet here he speaks of the former as soon to be done away. God was about to be revealed as the Father of all believers in every nation. The spirit or the soul of man, as influenced by the Holy Spirit, must worship God, and have communion with him. Spiritual affections, as shown in fervent prayers, supplications, and thanksgivings, form the worship of an upright heart, in which God delights and is glorified. The woman was disposed to leave the matter undecided, till the coming of the Messiah. But Christ told her, I that speak to thee, am He. She was an alien and a hostile Samaritan, merely speaking to her was thought to disgrace our Lord Jesus. Yet to this woman did our Lord reveal himself more fully than as yet he had done to any of his disciples. No past sins can bar our acceptance with him, if we humble ourselves before him, believing in him as the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</body></html>
