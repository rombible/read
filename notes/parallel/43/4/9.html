They did not say Shibboleth, but Sibboleth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/12-5.htm" title="And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No;">Judges 12:5-6</a>). They would not say "Teni lishekoth," but "Teni lisekoth."<p><span class= "bld">For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</span>--The original has not the articles, <span class= "ital">For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</span> This is a remark made by the writer to explain the point of the woman's question. She wondered that a Jew, weary and thirsty though he might be, should speak to her. For the origin of the Samaritans, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24-41</a>, and Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-52.htm" title="And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.">Luke 9:52</a>. The later Jewish authors abound in terms of reproach for them--<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> "He who eats the bread of a Samaritan is as he who eats swine's flesh;" "No Samaritan shall be made a proselyte;" "They have no share in the resurrection of the dead" (<span class= "ital">Pirke,</span> Rabbi Elieser, 38; comp. Farrar, <span class= "ital">Life of Christ,</span> i. 209, note). Jesus Himself speaks of a Samaritan as an alien (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-16.htm" title="And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.">Luke 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-18.htm" title="There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.">Luke 17:18</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-33.htm" title="But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,">Luke 10:33</a>), and is called a Samaritan and possessed of a devil (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?">John 8:48</a>). But the strictest Jews allowed exceptions to the forbidden intercourse. If bread was interdicted, fruit and vegetables were not; if boiled eggs were forbidden, fresh ones were not. At no time probably did the Galileans follow the practice of the Judaeans in this matter, and hence they go to the city to buy food, while the woman asks this question of a Jew whom she met on the road from Jerusalem. Later, it was only "because His face was as though He would go to Jerusalem "that the Samaritan village did not receive Him; and it is the Evangelist of the Jerusalem ministry, who would have called down fire from heaven then, who adds this note of explanation for his Greek readers now (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-52.htm" title="And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.">Luke 9:52-53</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The Samaritan woman therefore saith to him, How is it (compare this "how" with that of Nicodemus. Jesus had at once provoked inquiry, which he was not unwilling to gratify) - How is it that thou, being a Jew? She would have known that he was a Jew by his speech, for the Samaritans were accustomed to turn the sound of <span class="accented">sh</span> into that of <span class="accented">s</span>; and so, when Jesus said in Jewish Aramaic, <span class="accented">Teni lishekoth</span>, "Give me to drink," while she would herself have said, <span class="accented">Teni lise-koth</span>, his speech would betray him. Again, the contour of the Jewish face differs greatly from that of the Samaritan, and the customary fringes on their robes were of different national colours. Moreover, his appearance, travel stained, weary, and thirsty, on the great highway between Galilee and Judaea, would have suggested at once that he was no Samaritan. <span class="cmt_word">Askest drink from me, who am a Samaritan, and a woman, too?</span> Already this was a startling puzzle, for her experience so far had only shown her that <span class="cmt_word">Jews have no dealings</span> (a word only once and here used in the New Testament) <span class="cmt_word">with</span> <span class="cmt_word">Samaritans</span>. Most commentators suppose that this is an explanatory remark of the evangelist, pointing to the absence, in a hostile and haughty spirit, of all pleasant relations between the peoples (see note at commencement of chapter). We are not compelled to this conclusion. The words may just as likely have been the pert, half-ironical tone of the woman, who was drawing a contrast between the current profession of Israelites and the request which the need of Jesus had extorted (Moulton). The eighth verse had just said that the disciples had clearly some dealings with Samaritans, and had gone to purchase food at Sychar, taking with them the apparatus used for drawing water. This last fact is the evangelist's reason for introducing the remark of the woman. He would hardly have made it himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:4-26 There was great hatred between the Samaritans and the Jews. Christ's road from Judea to Galilee lay through Samaria. We should not go into places of temptation but when we needs must; and then must not dwell in them, but hasten through them. We have here our Lord Jesus under the common fatigue of travellers. Thus we see that he was truly a man. Toil came in with sin; therefore Christ, having made himself a curse for us, submitted to it. Also, he was a poor man, and went all his journeys on foot. Being wearied, he sat thus on the well; he had no couch to rest upon. He sat thus, as people wearied with travelling sit. Surely, we ought readily to submit to be like the Son of God in such things as these. Christ asked a woman for water. She was surprised because he did not show the anger of his own nation against the Samaritans. Moderate men of all sides are men wondered at. Christ took the occasion to teach her Divine things: he converted this woman, by showing her ignorance and sinfulness, and her need of a Saviour. By this living water is meant the Spirit. Under this comparison the blessing of the Messiah had been promised in the Old Testament. The graces of the Spirit, and his comforts, satisfy the thirsting soul, that knows its own nature and necessity. What Jesus spake figuratively, she took literally. Christ shows that the water of Jacob's well yielded a very short satisfaction. Of whatever waters of comfort we drink, we shall thirst again. But whoever partakes of the Spirit of grace, and the comforts of the gospel, shall never want that which will abundantly satisfy his soul. Carnal hearts look no higher than carnal ends. Give it me, saith she, not that I may have everlasting life, which Christ proposed, but that I come not hither to draw. The carnal mind is very ingenious in shifting off convictions, and keeping them from fastening. But how closely our Lord Jesus brings home the conviction to her conscience! He severely reproved her present state of life. The woman acknowledged Christ to be a prophet. The power of his word in searching the heart, and convincing the conscience of secret things, is a proof of Divine authority. It should cool our contests, to think that the things we are striving about are passing away. The object of worship will continue still the same, God, as a Father; but an end shall be put to all differences about the place of worship. Reason teaches us to consult decency and convenience in the places of our worship; but religion gives no preference to one place above another, in respect of holiness and approval with God. The Jews were certainly in the right. Those who by the Scriptures have obtained some knowledge of God, know whom they worship. The word of salvation was of the Jews. It came to other nations through them. Christ justly preferred the Jewish worship before the Samaritan, yet here he speaks of the former as soon to be done away. God was about to be revealed as the Father of all believers in every nation. The spirit or the soul of man, as influenced by the Holy Spirit, must worship God, and have communion with him. Spiritual affections, as shown in fervent prayers, supplications, and thanksgivings, form the worship of an upright heart, in which God delights and is glorified. The woman was disposed to leave the matter undecided, till the coming of the Messiah. But Christ told her, I that speak to thee, am He. She was an alien and a hostile Samaritan, merely speaking to her was thought to disgrace our Lord Jesus. Yet to this woman did our Lord reveal himself more fully than as yet he had done to any of his disciples. No past sins can bar our acceptance with him, if we humble ourselves before him, believing in him as the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</body></html>
