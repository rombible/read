Now faith would be strong, and now almost give way; but he travels on with the words, "Thy son liveth," which had come to him as a voice from heaven, sustaining and cheering him. Again he hears the same words, "Thy son liveth!" but they are spoken by the servants, who have come to meet him, and bring from Capernaum the glad news that he had himself heard at Cana.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now as he was going down</span> to Capernaum (if we take any of the more recent determinations of the site of Cana (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1, 2</a>), this means that he had traversed a distance of between twenty and twenty-five miles, so that there is no reason to treat with ridicule or regard as inexplicable the time taken for the return journey, or that a night should have been spent in the transit from Cana), <span class="cmt_word">his servants</span> <span class="cmt_word">met</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span>, <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>, <span class="cmt_word">that his boy lived</span>. The oblique form is certainly far more reasonable, less mechanical, and more likely to have been altered into the direct form by an incautious copyist from the previous verse, than to have constituted the original text. Note that Jesus used the most dignified title, "son" (<span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); the father employs the tender diminutive (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); while the servants use the domestic term (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:43-54 The father was a nobleman, yet the son was sick. Honours and titles are no security from sickness and death. The greatest men must go themselves to God, must become beggars. The nobleman did not stop from his request till he prevailed. But at first he discovered the weakness of his faith in the power of Christ. It is hard to persuade ourselves that distance of time and place, are no hinderance to the knowledge, mercy, and power of our Lord Jesus. Christ gave an answer of peace. Christ's saying that the soul lives, makes it alive. The father went his way, which showed the sincerity of his faith. Being satisfied, he did not hurry home that night, but returned as one easy in his own mind. His servants met him with the news of the child's recovery. Good news will meet those that hope in God's word. Diligent comparing the works of Jesus with his word, will confirm our faith. And the bringing the cure to the family brought salvation to it. Thus an experience of the power of one word of Christ, may settle the authority of Christ in the soul. The whole family believed likewise. The miracle made Jesus dear to them. The knowledge of Christ still spreads through families, and men find health and salvation to their souls.</body></html>
