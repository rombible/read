Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm" title="And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.">John 18:15</a>.

He asked, we may think, about the number of Christ's followers; the aim they had in view; the principles which He had taught them. The object of the questions was apparently to find some technical evidence in Christ's own words on which they may support the charges they are about to bring against Him in the legal trial before Caiaphas.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> connects the following incident with the thirteenth and fourteenth verses. <span class="cmt_word">The high priest</span>. Hengstenberg, Godet, and Westcott here say that the high priest is Caiaphas, present <span class="accented">i.e. at</span> the examination over which Annas presides as the older man; but Renan, Meyer, Lange, Steinmeyer ('Passion and Resurrection History'), and Moulton, with many others, say Annas was here the high priest in question. Tholuck dismisses the idea of Annas altogether, and, by inverting the place of Ver. 24 or treating the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> as pluperfect, suppose that Annas <span class="accented">had</span> sent the Lord to Caiaphas (so Calvin, De Wette, Hase, and others), who thus commenced his interrogatory. But the text of Ver. 24, now recovered, will not admit of this rendering. We find it far more satisfactory to accept this less formal examination, under the presidency of Annas, at which an attempt is made to put the Lord, if possible, to a test which will incriminate him. Keim says, "If Caiaphas were the acting high priest, and at the same time the soul of the movement against Jesus, it was for him and not for his father-in-law to take knowledge of the matter and report to the Sanhedrin." We must choose between two difficulties: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Caiaphas is first spoken of as "high priest," who, as we know from the synoptists, conducted the examination-in-chief, and then that Annas, as conducting a preliminary examination, is also styled "high priest" without any explanation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> or we must admit the supposition that after Caiaphas had asked these incriminating questions, <span class="cmt_word">Annas</span> (who was not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>), sent Jesus bound <span class="accented">to Caiaphas the high priest</span>. The former hypothesis is the easier. <span class="cmt_word">The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples</span>, the extent of his following, the number of his accomplices, the ramifications of the society or kingdom he professed to have founded, and <span class="cmt_word">concerning his doctrine,</span> the secret teachings that held his followers together. He evidently knows the claims of Jesus well enough; his spies and officers have continually been dogging the steps of Jesus, and hitherto he has failed to gain evidence positively incriminating him. And as his representatives a few days ago were utterly foiled, notwithstanding their clever design, he hopes by his own ingenuity to entrap the Lord in his talk. Our Lord, anxious not to endanger his disciples, points to the publicity of his ministry, and appeals to all and sundry who have heard him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:13-27 Simon Peter denied his Master. The particulars have been noticed in the remarks on the other Gospels. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. The sin of lying is a fruitful sin; one lie needs another to support it, and that another. If a call to expose ourselves to danger be clear, we may hope God will enable us to honour him; if it be not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame ourselves. They said nothing concerning the miracles of Jesus, by which he had done so much good, and which proved his doctrine. Thus the enemies of Christ, whilst they quarrel with his truth, wilfully shut their eyes against it. He appeals to those who heard him. The doctrine of Christ may safely appeal to all that know it, and those who judge in truth bear witness to it. Our resentment of injuries must never be passionate. He reasoned with the man that did him the injury, and so may we.</body></html>
