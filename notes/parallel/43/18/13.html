(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-19.htm" title="The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.">John 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm" title="Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.">John 18:24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For he was father in law to Caiaphas.</span>--The personal relationship between Annas and Caiaphas had led to a closeness of connection in official duties, which makes it difficult, with our partial knowledge of the circumstances, to trace the position taken by each in the trial of our Lord. This remark of St. John's suggests that Annas may have occupied part of the high priest's palace. He had been high priest. He is called high priest in the following year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-6.htm" title="And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.">Acts 4:6</a>).

It does not follow that the high priest (Caiaphas) was not present at this investigation; but it was altogether of an informal character.<p><span class= "bld">Which was the high priest that same year.</span>--On this clause, and the whole of the following verse, comp.

The particulars have been noticed in the remarks on the other Gospels. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. The sin of lying is a fruitful sin; one lie needs another to support it, and that another. If a call to expose ourselves to danger be clear, we may hope God will enable us to honour him; if it be not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame ourselves. They said nothing concerning the miracles of Jesus, by which he had done so much good, and which proved his doctrine. Thus the enemies of Christ, whilst they quarrel with his truth, wilfully shut their eyes against it. He appeals to those who heard him. The doctrine of Christ may safely appeal to all that know it, and those who judge in truth bear witness to it. Our resentment of injuries must never be passionate. He reasoned with the man that did him the injury, and so may we.</body></html>
