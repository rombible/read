But this is perfectly compatible with the obvious fact that the eight disciples and the favored three should have shrunk behind our Lord when he calmly emerged from the entrance to the garden, and that their position would be thus sufficiently indicated. It is remarkable that John, who has been accused of personal malice to Judas (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by those who, like Renan, admit, to a certain extent, the Johan-nine authorship), does not refer to the traitor's kiss.
