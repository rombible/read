Others have, "<span class= "ital">The</span> other disciple," which would mean, "The well-known disciple." It has been usual to understand that John himself is intended by this designation, and this opinion agrees with the general reticence of the Gospel with regard to him. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>; and <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 375.) It agrees also with the fact that Peter and John are elsewhere found in special connection with each other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/3-3.htm" title="Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.">Acts 3:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-11.htm" title="And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.">Acts 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm" title="Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.">Acts 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-19.htm" title="But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, judge you.">Acts 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-14.htm" title="Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:">Acts 8:14</a>). We are warranted, therefore, in saying that this opinion is probable, but not in assuming that it is necessarily true, as is often done. It may be, for instance, that by this term the Evangelist indicates his brother James, who is never mentioned in this Gospel. The fact that he is himself called "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>; comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 375), is against rather than for the opinion that he is here called "another disciple." If we adopt the reading, "<span class= "ital">the</span> other disciple," the opinion has more support.<p><span class= "bld">Was known unto the high priest.</span>--How he was known we have no means of judging. We may, however, note that the name "John" occurs among the names of the kindred of the high priest in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-6.htm" title="And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.">Acts 4:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Into the palace of the high priest.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">into the court of the high priest.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-3.htm" title="Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, to the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,">Matthew 26:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-58.htm" title="But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.">Matthew 26:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-69.htm" title="Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.">Matthew 26:69</a>.) St. John uses the word elsewhere only of the sheepfold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>). It has been established beyond doubt that the title "high priest" may have been and often was given to those who had held the sacred office. We cannot, therefore, say positively that it is not here given to Annas. It is, however, in the highest degree improbable that it is given in this chapter, after the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>, to Annas and Caiaphas without distinction. The writer has in that verse clearly marked out Caiaphas as the high priest that year, and consistency requires that we should uniformly understand him to be designated by the title.<p>The apparent difficulty here is met by the remark in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>, that Annas was father-in-law to Caiaphas. (See Note there.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>. After the first dispersion of all the disciples, two of them gathered up their courage. <span class="cmt_word">Simon Peter was following Jesus</span> "afar off" (say all the synoptists), "even <span class="accented">up to"</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f64;&#x3c2;</span>, the court of the high priest" (say Matthew and Mark). The account of Matthew implies that, having come up to the door, he went <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, and sat down to see the end; he does not say how he was admitted, though, by the use of the two prepositions, he implies there was a cause. And also <span class="cmt_word">another</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciple: but that disciple was known to the high priest,</span> and therefore to the officials, <span class="cmt_word">and went fix with Jesus into</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, right within) <span class="cmt_word">the court of the high priest</span>; for he was well known to be, and from the first did not pretend to be anything else than, one of the disciples of Jesus. From the known habit of the evangelist in other places, the vast majority of commentators at once conclude (see Introduction, p. 54.) that the writer designates himself by this reference. Godet and Watkins are disposed to question it, and imagine that it may have been the author's brother James. With the absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the matter is left in doubt. But by this supposition much of the justification is lost, which the writer of the Gospel quietly supplies, touching his own ability to describe what otherwise would never have entered into the evangelic narrative. The supposition we have made above, that Annas and Caiaphas occupied the same palace, or different portions of the same edifice, solves the chief difficulty. Annas held his preliminary unofficial inquiry in his department of the building. The difficult question arises whether Annas was assisted or not by the reigning "high priest" in conducting this examination (see Ver. 19). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:13-27 Simon Peter denied his Master. The particulars have been noticed in the remarks on the other Gospels. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. The sin of lying is a fruitful sin; one lie needs another to support it, and that another. If a call to expose ourselves to danger be clear, we may hope God will enable us to honour him; if it be not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame ourselves. They said nothing concerning the miracles of Jesus, by which he had done so much good, and which proved his doctrine. Thus the enemies of Christ, whilst they quarrel with his truth, wilfully shut their eyes against it. He appeals to those who heard him. The doctrine of Christ may safely appeal to all that know it, and those who judge in truth bear witness to it. Our resentment of injuries must never be passionate. He reasoned with the man that did him the injury, and so may we.</body></html>
