(Comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 371.) All the Evangelists narrate the coming of Judas. John only remembers that the spot was one belonging, it may be, to a friend or disciple, where Jesus was in the habit of going with His disciples, and that Judas therefore knew the place, and knew that he would probably find them there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Judas also, who was betraying him</span> (notice present tense in contrast with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a>), <span class="cmt_word">knew the place: because oftentimes Jesus resorted</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was assembled there</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thither with his disciples</span>. Luke tells us that during this very week (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>) they had passed their nights (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) on the "Mount of Olives," and it is most likely that Judas conjectured that they had gone thither again to pass the night. The fact here mentioned by John, that Judas knew the place, disposes of the ignorant and vulgar taunt of Celsus, that our Lord sought to escape from his enemies after having challenged them (see Orig., 'Contra Cel.,' 2:9. 10). Keim, with perversity, declares that John only represented the place as known to Judas, in order to enhance the voluntary nature of the sacrifice. Some explanation may thus be given of the fact that the eleven disciples, having reached an accustomed place of repose, all slumbered and slept, and were not able to watch one hour. The choice of this particular garden for the purpose cannot be unraveled. Dean Plumptre <span class="accented">suggests</span> that it was the property of Lazarus, who was no other than the rich young man, who sold his all and gave to the poor, all but one solitary garment, and that he himself was keeping this one <span class="accented">possession</span> for the <span class="accented">uses</span> of his Lord on that very night, and that when in danger of arrest he it was that fled away naked. This is pure conjecture. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-12 Sin began in the garden of Eden, there the curse was pronounced, there the Redeemer was promised; and in a garden that promised Seed entered into conflict with the old serpent.
