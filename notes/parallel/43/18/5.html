He is mentioned in accordance with the vivid impression which the fact left upon the Apostle's mind. Judas, who had been one of them, who had been present with them, and had received bread from his Master's hand on that very night, was now standing with the officers of the Sanhedrin and the Roman band, who had come to capture Him! The position of the words suggests also that Judas was in some way specially connected with the fact that on hearing the words "I am He," they fell to the ground, as though fear passed from him to those with him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They answered him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus saith unto them, I am</span> <span class="accented">he<span class="cmt_word"></span>.</span> Then, in all probability, the miscreant, the son of perdition, said," Hail, Master!" and kissed him; and there followed before and after his act the sublime replies given, "Companion, wherefore art thou come?" and "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" John, however, overwhelmed with the majesty and spontaneous self-devotion of the Lord, calls attention to the language he addressed to the "baud" which surrounded him. In some royal emphasis of tone he said, "I <span class="accented">am</span> (he)," and the same kind of effect followed as on various occasions had proved how powerless, without his permission, the machinations of his foes really were. In the temple courts, and on the precipice of Nazareth, the murderous Jews and Galilaeans were foiled (compare the murderers of Marius and of Coligny) by the moral grandeur of his bearing; and <span class="cmt_word">when he said, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;</span>). Whether this was a supernatural event, or allied to the sublime force of moral greatness flashing in his eye or echoing in the tone of his voice, we cannot say, but associating it with other events in his history, the supernatural in his case becomes perfectly natural. It was so that he whose "I am he" had hushed the waves and cast out the devil, and before whose glance and word John and Paul fell to the earth, as if struck with lightning, did perhaps allow his very captors (prepared by Judas for some display of his might) to feel how powerless they were against him. It is remarkable that our narrative should place between the "I <span class="accented">am he"</span> and its effect, the tautologous remark if there be nothing to explain it, <span class="cmt_word">Now Judas also, who was Betraying him, was standing with them</span>. This implies that Judas had taken some step equivalent to that described in the synoptic narrative. There is some momentary consolation in the thought that the traitor fell to the ground with his gang, and for an instant saw the transcendent crime he had committed in betraying the innocent blood with the kiss of treachery and shame. Thoma sees in the approximation of Judas the approach of the prophetic Beast to the true King, and endeavors out of the letters of his name to read the number 666! It is true that <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a> represents Satan as having entered into Judas. He stood there, he fell there, with the powers of darkness.
