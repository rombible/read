Each of the Evangelists has given us a narrative of the trial and death of our Lord. The narrative of each naturally differs by greater or less fulness, or as each regarded the events from his own point of view, from that of all the others. It is only with that which is special to St. John that the notes on his narrative have to deal. The general facts and questions arising from them have already been treated in the notes on the parallel passages.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">He went forth with his disciples</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> He went forth from the city. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-31.htm" title="But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.">John 14:31</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The brook Cedron.</span>--The Greek words mean exactly "the winter torrent Kedron," and occur again in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-23.htm" title="And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.">2Samuel 15:23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-13.htm" title="Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.">2Kings 15:13</a>. The name is formed from a Hebrew word which means "black." The torrent was the "Niger" of Judaea, and was so called from the colour of its turbid waters, or from the darkness of the chasm through which they flowed. The name seems to have been properly applied not so much to the torrent itself as to the ravine through which it flowed, on the east of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives. Its sides are for the most part precipitous, but here and there paths cross it, and at the bottom are cultivated strips of land. Its depth varies, but in some places it is not less than 100 feet. (Comp. article, "Kidron," in Kitto's <span class= "ital">Biblical Cyclop?dia,</span> vol. ii., p. 731; and for the reading see <span class= "ital">Excursus B: Some Variations in the Text of St. John's Gospel.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Where was a garden.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-36.htm" title="Then comes Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit you here, while I go and pray yonder.">Matthew 26:36</a>. St. John does not record the passion of Gethsemane, but this verse indicates its place in the narrative. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.">John 12:27</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-42.htm">John 19:42</a>. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">The outer glorification of Christ in his Passion</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> -<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The <span class="accented">betrayal</span>, <span class="accented">the majesty of his bearing</span>, <span class="accented">accompanied by hints of the bitter cup</span>. Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus had spoken these words</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> had offered the prayer, and communed with his Father touching himself, his disciples, and his whole Church - <span class="cmt_word">he went forth with his disciples</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the resting-place chosen by him on his way from the "guest-chamber" to the Valley of Kedron; it may have been from some corner of the vast temple area, or some sheltered spot under the shadow of its walls, where he uttered his wondrous discourse and intercession. <span class="cmt_word">He went over the ravine</span> - or, strictly speaking, winter-torrent - <span class="cmt_word">of Kedron</span>. The stream rises north of Jerusalem, and separates the city on its eastern side from Scopas and the Mount of Olives. It reaches its deepest depression at the point where it joins the Valley of Hinnom near the well of Rogel, contributing to the peculiar physical conformation of the city. The stream is in summer dry to its bed, and Robinson, Grove, and Warren conjecture, in agreement with an old tradition, that there is, below the present surface of its bed, a subterraneous watercourse, whose waters may be heard flowing. The stream takes a sudden bend to the southeast at En-Rogel, and makes its way, by the convent of Saba, to the Dead Sea. It is not without interest that this note of place given by St. John alone - for the three other evangelists simply speak of "the Mount of <span class="accented">Olives"</span> <span class="accented">- brings</span> the narrative into relation with the story of David's flight from Absalom by the same route, and also the Jewish expectation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>), and Mohammedan prediction, that here will take place the final judgment (Smith's 'Dictionary,' art. "<span class="accented">Kedron</span>," by Grove; 'Pictorial Palestine,' vol. 1; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 1:269: Winer's 'B. Realworterbuch,' art. "Kedron;" Dean Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine;' 'The Recovery of Jerusalem,' by Capt. Warren and Capt. Wilson, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. and 5.). <span class="cmt_word">Where was a garden</span>. This reference is in agreement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-32.htm">Mark 14:32</a>) with the synoptic description of the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "parcel of <span class="accented">ground</span>," small farm, or olive yard, enclosed from the rest of the hillside, and called "Gethsemane" (<span class="accented">gath-shammi</span>, press for oil). The traditional site of the garden dates back to the time of Constantine, and may be the true scene of the agony described by the synoptists. There are still remaining "the eight aged olive trees," which carry back the associations to the hour of the great travail. It is certain that the general features of the scene still closely correspond with what was visible on the awful night ('Pictorial Palestine,' 1:86, 98). Patristic and mediaeval writers, with Hengstenberg and Wordsworth, see parallels between the garden of Eden lost by man's sin, and the garden of Gethsemane where the second Adam met the prince of this world, and bore the weight of human transgression and shame, and regained for man the paradise which Adam lost. It is still more interesting to notice a further touch recorded by John: <span class="cmt_word">Into which</span> - into the quiet retreat and partial concealment of which - <span class="cmt_word">he</span> (Jesus) <span class="cmt_word">entered himself, and his disciples</span>. We know from the other Gospels that they were separated -eight remained on watch near the entrance, and Peter and James and John went further into the recesses of the garden, and again, "about a stone's cast," in the depth of the olive-shade, our blessed Lord retired to "pray." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-12 Sin began in the garden of Eden, there the curse was pronounced, there the Redeemer was promised; and in a garden that promised Seed entered into conflict with the old serpent. Christ was buried also in a garden. Let us, when we walk in our gardens, take occasion from thence to mediate on Christ's sufferings in a garden. Our Lord Jesus, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth and asked, Whom seek ye? When the people would have forced him to a crown, he withdrew, ch.</body></html>
