The impression is rather that it was produced by the majesty of His person, and by the answer which to Jewish ears conveyed the unutterable name, "Jehovah" (I AM). (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-24.htm" title="I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.">John 8:24-25</a>.)

Christ was buried also in a garden. Let us, when we walk in our gardens, take occasion from thence to mediate on Christ's sufferings in a garden.
