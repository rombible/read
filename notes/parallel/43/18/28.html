The word is used primarily for the general's tent in the Roman camps, and for the legal residence of the chief of a province. Now, the ordinary residence of the Roman governors was at Caesarea, but at the time of the great feasts they were in the habit of going up to Jerusalem, and at a later time than this (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:14. 8; 15:5) the governors utilized for this purpose the former palace of Herod, a gorgeous residence in the upper city. It is, however, more probable that Pilate occupied the palace of the Castle of Antonia, overlooking the northwest corner of the temple area, and having means of direct communication with it. Edersheim inclines to the palace of Herod. From the high-priestly palace to the castle they led Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">And it was early.</span> [In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x1fd6;&#x1ffd;</span> is equivalent to the fourth watch of the night, between three and six o'clock. The breadth of the phrase would cover the period of the hurried council (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27.htm">Matthew 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15.htm">Mark 15</a>.) and the session of Pilate. The Roman judgments were often conducted in early morning (Seneca, 'De Ira,' 2:7) <span class="accented">- prima luce</span>.] The council having in their indecent haste conveyed Jesus to the Praetorium, while (<span class="cmt_word">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">they themselves went not into the Praetorium,</span> <span class="cmt_word">lest they should be defiled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, the solemn word for "profane" in Plato, Sophocles, and the LXX.). This defilement by entrance into the house of a Gentile was not an enactment of the Law, but was a purely rabbinic observance (Delitzsch, 'Talmudische Studien,' 14. (1874); 'Zeitschrift fur die gesammte Luth. Theol.'). We find it operative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>, and thus a hint given not merely of the author's knowledge of the inner life of Judaism, but of his quiet recognition of the stupendous spectacle of malicious ritualism, and of unscrupulous antagonism to the Holiest One, busying itself about attention to the letter of that which was only a rabbinic legislation. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">might eat the Passover</span>. Here in this passage we come once more face to face with the persistent puzzle occasioned by the divergent intimations of John and the synoptists as to the day of our Lord's death. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-17.htm">Matthew 26:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12-14</a> this very phrase is used for the preparation of that Paschal supper which our Lord celebrated with his disciples (see Introduction, pp. 93, etc.). So that we have at any rate a discordant verbal usage, however the problem be solved. The day is breaking, which constitutes, according to John (<span class="accented">prima facie</span>), the 14th of Nisan, in the evening of which and commencement of the 15th the Passover would be killed. According to the synoptists, that Passover meal was already over, and the first great day of the feast had commenced - the day of convocation, with sabbatic functions and duties. The statements are apparently in hopeless variance. Many emphasize, exaggerate, and declare insoluble the contradiction, repudiating either the authority of John or that of the synoptists. Meyer and Lucke give their verdict with John, the eye-witness, as against the synoptic tradition. Strauss and Keim, who also hold the invincible discrepancy, lift the synoptic account to a comparatively high state of historic validity, and thereby discredit the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel. We have two methods of reconciling the difficulty: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> An endeavor to show that the synoptic narrative itself is inconsistent with the idea that the night of the Passion was the night of the general Passover. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> That the entire proceeding of the trial was inconsistent with the feast-day; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that Simon the Cyrenian could not bear the cross on that day; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the circumstance that that Friday evening was the preparation of the Passover; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> that the reckonings of the weeks till the Pentecost Sunday are all made to show that the <span class="accented">synoptic</span> narrative itself admits that the Crucifixion took place <span class="accented">before</span> the Passover meal. So also does the decision of the priests, that they would put Jesus to death <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-5.htm">Matthew 26:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-2.htm">Mark 14:2</a>). On this understanding the passage before us is interpreted in its natural sense; the Jews were unwilling to contract ceremonial defilement, because they were about to eat the Passover, and so with respect to the other references in John's Gospel, which all, <span class="accented">prima facto</span>, suggest the same chronological arrangement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A very powerful argument has been constructed, however, which brings John's account here, as well as elsewhere, into harmony with the supposed assertion of a synoptic narrative, that the Paschal meal preceded the trial of Jesus. It is said by Hengstenberg, M'Clellan, Edersheim, and others that this unwillingness to defile themselves was because they were anticipating their midday meal, at which sacrificial offerings and thank offerings, also called <span class="accented">chagigah</span>, were regarded as "eating the Passover" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7-9</a>). It is argued that, if the Jews were thinking of a meal which would not come off till sundown, their fear of defilement was illusory. But examination of these passages shows that there is a distinction drawn between the Paschal <span class="accented">lamb</span> and the cattle which might form part of the general sacrificial feasting of the following days, and that the term "Passover" is strictly limited to the Paschal <span class="accented">lamb</span>. <span class="accented">M</span>oreover, the duration of the defilement thus contracted would certainly have prevented them from any participation in the <span class="accented">slaying</span> of the Paschal lamb "between the evenings" of the 14th and 15th of Nisan. Dr. Moulton has made the ingenious suggestion that John's statement here is brought into harmony with the synoptic narrative, by the supposition that the chief priests had been disturbed in their Passover preparations, and were intending to complete their meal as soon as the decision of the Roman governor had been given. This very supposition reveals the exceeding unlikelihood that all the hierarchs and chief scribes, Pharisees, and elders of the people had consented to forego the due solemnization of their national rite on that previous evening. This supposition involves a much greater violation of Passover regulation than that Jesus and the twelve should have anticipated the ceremony by a few hours. If the day is the 14th of Nisan, all, so far as John's account is concerned, is obvious. I am therefore disposed to agree with Meyer, Keim, De Pressense, Baur, Neander, De Wette, Ebrard, Ewald, Westcott, Godet, and Lucke, against Hengstenberg, Wieseler, Tholuck, Luthardt, M'Clellan, and many others. The full interpretation of the synoptic narrative is discussed elsewhere (Introduction, p. 92.). Certainly John makes no reference to the Passover in his account of the Last Supper, neither does he refer to the institution of the Lord's Supper. It will not be just to say, with Renan, that John has substituted the foot-washing for the sacramental least. (On the principle of his omissions, see Introduction, pp. 100-105.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:28-32 It was unjust to put one to death who had done so much good, therefore the Jews were willing to save themselves from reproach. Many fear the scandal of an ill thing, more than the sin of it. Christ had said he should be delivered to the Gentiles, and they should put him to death; hereby that saying was fulfilled. He had said that he should be crucified, lifted up. If the Jews had judged him by their law, he had been stoned; crucifying never was used among the Jews. It is determined concerning us, though not discovered to us, what death we shall die: this should free us from disquiet about that matter. Lord, what, when, and how, thou hast appointed.</body></html>
