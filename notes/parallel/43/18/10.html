The fact is recorded by all the Evangelists. St. John only tells us that it was done by Peter, and that the servant's name was Malchus. He is also careful to note, as St. Luke does too, that it was the "right ear."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Simon Peter</span>. The other evangelists simply tell us that one of the number of the disciples performed the following act. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> here is introduced between Simon and Peter, as if to imply that it was not merely Simon son of Jonas, but Simon the Rock, the man of mighty impulsive passion, ready, as he said a few hours since, to go with his Master to prison and to death. The name and identification of Peter with the brave man who struck at least one blow for his Master, is a proof, not of John's animosity against Peter, or any desire to humble him, but rather to exalt him. The extraordinary concomitance of this act with all the other delineations of Peter's character is another undesigned hint of the authenticity of the narrative. Simon Peter, then, <span class="cmt_word">having a sword</span>. Here we see the unintentional agreement with the synoptic narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-38.htm">Luke 22:38</a>). Nothing would be less likely than that Peter should have a sword at his disposal; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> judging from the Johannine narrative. The Gospel of Luke explains it. Having a sword, he <span class="cmt_word">drew it, and smote the slave</span> (not one of the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, but <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, body-servant) of the high priest, and eat off his right ear. The slave, in receiving such a wound, must have been in fearful danger of his life. The reference to the <span class="accented">right</span> ear, mentioned also by Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-50.htm">Luke 22:50</a>), is noteworthy. <span class="cmt_word">Now the name of the slave was Malchus</span>. Here the eye-witness, not the theologian, nor the dramatist, reveals his hand. Thoma sees, however, the fulfillment of prophetic outline, and a reference to the kings and chief captains, the Malchuses and chiliarchs, that are ultimately to flee before him. The subsequently mentioned circumstance (Ver. 15) that the evangelist was "known to the high priest," explains this recovery of an otherwise valueless name. The instant when Peter cried, "Shall we smite with the sword?" was most opportune. For the moment Peter felt that the whole band could be discomfited by a bold stroke. Christ with his word, the brave-hearted apostle with his weapon, could scatter all the foes of the Lord. As on so many other occasions, Peter gives advice to the Master, only to find himself in grievous mistake. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-12 Sin began in the garden of Eden, there the curse was pronounced, there the Redeemer was promised; and in a garden that promised Seed entered into conflict with the old serpent. Christ was buried also in a garden. Let us, when we walk in our gardens, take occasion from thence to mediate on Christ's sufferings in a garden. Our Lord Jesus, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth and asked, Whom seek ye? When the people would have forced him to a crown, he withdrew, ch.</body></html>
