The word occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm" title="There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,">Acts 10:1</a> ("the Italian band") and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-1.htm" title="And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.">Acts 27:1</a> ("Augustus' band"). The Authorised version misleads, by closely connecting in one clause two distinct things, "a band of men and officers." The band was Roman; the "officers" were the Temple servants, of whom we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-32.htm" title="The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.">John 7:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-45.htm" title="Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?">John 7:45</a>. These were sent, here, as there, by the chief priests and Pharisees, with Judas for their guide, and their authority was supported by the civil power.<p><span class= "bld">Lanterns and torches and weapons.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">with torches and lamps</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1</a>) <span class= "ital">and arms.</span> The torches and lamps were part of the regular military equipment for night service. Dionysius describes soldiers rushing out of their tents with torches and lamps in the same words which are used here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-40.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Said I not to you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?">John 11:40</a>). They are not mentioned in the other Gospels. St. Matthew and St. Mark describe the "weapons" as "swords and staves."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judas therefore</span>, because he knew the place, was able treacherously to use his knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">Having received the cohort</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> is used for the lemon or portion of the legion of soldiers, who, under the direction of the Roman procurator, garrisoned the Tower of Antonia, which dominated the north-east temple courts. The article (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) is probably used because the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, military tribune, chief captain, or commander of the thousand men, had (Ver. 12) accompanied the detachment. "The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, is used by Polybius for the Latin <span class="accented">manipulus</span>, not <span class="accented">cohors</span> (Polyb., 11:23), consisting of about two hundred men, the third part of a cohort" (Westcott). It should, however, be observed that the word is used of the Roman garrison of the tower (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-31.htm">Acts 21:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:04. 3; ' Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. 8). <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> was the proper name for the commander of a <span class="accented">cohors</span>, equivalent to one-sixth of a legion, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a thousand men and a hundred and twenty horsemen. The strength of the cohort differed according to circumstances and need. Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:04. 2) says that some <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> consisted of a thousand, some of six hundred, men. It is not rational to suppose that the whole cohort were visibly <span class="accented">present</span>, but they were-present in close proximity. Though John alone mentions the Roman <span class="accented">soldiers</span>, yet cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53, 54</a>, where our Lord says, "Thinkest thou not that I could pray (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented">my Father</span>, <span class="accented">and he would henceforth furnish me with more than twelve legions of angels?"</span> - a legion of angels for each one of the little group. The presence of this band of Roman soldiers with the Jewish police gives very great force and impressiveness to this scene of Israel's degradation and of the world's assault upon the Divine Savior. The other hints given by the synoptists of the presence of weapons in the "band," is Peter's use of the sword. Judas brought with him, not only the drilled and armed Roman soldiers, but <span class="cmt_word">the officers from the chief priests and of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Pharisees</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a detachment of the Jewish guard of the temple, under direction of the Sanhedrin. The chief priests would have small difficulty in securing the aid of a detachment of the Roman garrison to prevent popular outbreak at the time of the feast. These <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, under the direction of the chief priests and Pharisees, have been mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32</a> and 45, and the same name is given to the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-22.htm">Acts 5:22, 26</a>, where the high priests and Sadducees are spoken of as their masters. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-4.htm">Luke 22:4, 52</a> the commandants of the temple are spoken of in the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. The Jewish guard was under the custody of one officer, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and he was a man of high rank and dignity (Josephus, ' Ant.,' 20:6. 2; ' Bell. Jud.,' 2:17.2) - not two, but one; the reference to more than one must therefore point to the Roman military official as well, thus unconsciously sustaining the more definite information given by John. Judas with his band <span class="cmt_word">cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons</span>; for, though it was the Paschal full moon, they were intent on finding an individual, whom Judas would identify for them, amid the depths of the olive shades. (<span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span> is in its primary sense a torch, or even meteoric light, but it is used for a lamp or lantern; and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> also is used for "torch" primarily, with secondary meaning of "lantern.") Matthew and Mark mention "swords" and "staves," but say nothing of the flaring torches which so arrested the eve of John. Thoma sees a reference to the frequent declaration of Christ, that he was the "Light of the world," and to the contrast between that light and the power of darkness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-12 Sin began in the garden of Eden, there the curse was pronounced, there the Redeemer was promised; and in a garden that promised Seed entered into conflict with the old serpent. Christ was buried also in a garden. Let us, when we walk in our gardens, take occasion from thence to mediate on Christ's sufferings in a garden. Our Lord Jesus, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth and asked, Whom seek ye? When the people would have forced him to a crown, he withdrew, ch.</body></html>
