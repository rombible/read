Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.

By "of this world" we are to understand that the nature and origin of His kingdom are not of this world, not that His kingdom will not extend in this world. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.">John 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>.)

His "servants" are His disciples, who would be in this relation to Him if He were a temporal king, and the crowds such as those who had sought to make Him king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm" title="When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.">John 6:15</a>), and had filled Jerusalem with the cry, "Hosanna: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm" title="Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.">John 12:13</a>).

It was proved by His standing bound in the presence of the procurator. The clause has been strangely pressed into the service of millennial views by interpreting it, "But <span class= "ital">now</span> My kingdom is not from hence. Hereafter it will be." For the true sense of "now," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you should have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.">John 9:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-22.htm" title="If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.">John 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-24.htm" title="If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.">John 15:24</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - In reply to this challenge, <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span> - obviously assuming the fact that he was a king in a sense entirely different from that which had been maliciously suggested to Pilate - <span class="cmt_word">My kingdom</span> - the kingdom that is mine - <span class="cmt_word">is not of this world.</span> Neither now nor at any future period will it derive its origin from this world. So far as Christ is King, his royal power and state are not furnished by earthly force, or fleshly ordinances, or physical energies, or material wealth, or imperial armies. The dominion that he will wield will be one over hearts and lives; the authority of the Lord Jesus cannot be arrested or overpowered by physical force. Most commentators justly regard this as a spiritual manifesto of the sources and quality of the kingdom of Christ, and a foreshadowing of the separation between the spiritual and secular power - a declaration that all effort to embody Christian laws and government in compulsory forms, and to defend them by penal sanctions and temporal force, is disloyalty to the royal rank and crown rights of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hengstenberg regards the assertion as precisely the reverse; sees in the passage, "rightly understood, the very opposite purpose. The kingdom that sprang directly from heaven must have absolute authority over all the earth, and it will not submit to be put into obscurity. The kingdoms of this world must become the kingdom of the Lord and his Anointed, and he shall reign for ever and ever." This is true, but not along the lines or with the machinery of earthly rule and authority. The influence and authority of Heaven works upon the spirit by truth and righteousness and peace, and thus transforms institutions, permeates society from the ground of the heart, modifies the relations between the members of a household, and transfigures those between a ruler and his subjects, between the master and his slaves, between labor and capital, and between man and man. Whenever it is triumphant, whenever the lives of kings and their peoples are sanctified by supreme obedience to Christ the King, then war will be impossible, all tyrannies and slaveries will be abolished, all malice and violence of monarchs or mobs will be at an end; then the wolfish and the lamblike nature will be at peace. Then all the means for enforcing the will of one against another will be done away. He will have put down all rule, authority, and power; for <span class="accented">he</span> must reign, and he alone. This kingdom is not (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) "from," "out of," this world's methods or resources; does not begin from without and establish itself, or propagate or preserve itself, from the world, which is a rival, and is not to be coerced but drawn to itself. Like the individual disciple, the kingdom may be in the world, but not <span class="accented">of</span> it. Christ proceeded, <span class="cmt_word">If the kingdom that is mine were from this world,</span> which it is not (mark the form of the condition), then, on that Supposition, <span class="cmt_word">would the servants</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, generally translated "officers") <span class="cmt_word">that are mine fight</span>, with physical force, <span class="cmt_word">in order that I should not be delivered up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to the Jews</span>. The supposition that the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of whom our Lord spoke were "the angels" (as Bengel, Lampe, Stier, and at one time Luthardt, imagined), is distinctly repudiated by the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "<span class="accented">of</span> this present world." If it were the case, as it is not, then would my officers be, not a handful of disciples (whom he generally calls <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), but the servants who would be appropriate to my royal mission, <span class="accented">- then would my servants</span> be busily fighting that I should not be delivered up by the Roman power that is for the moment thrown over me like a shield, to the Jews, who are thirsting for my blood. The loud cry of hatred and vengeance may even at this moment have pierced the interior of the Praetorium, thus giving its force, if not form, to the sentence. Godet thinks our Lord was referring to the crowds who actually gathered round him on Palm Sunday, and not to hypothetical <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; but the force of the condition goes down deeper, and, moreover, such language might have awakened the suspicion that, after all, Jesus <span class="accented">had</span> a political following, if he should choose to evoke it. Observe that this entire severance between "the Jews" and the friends of Christ, which, though occasionally adopted by the evangelist, is not the customary method of our Lord. The moment at which the Savior speaks gives great significance to the phraseology (observe <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>; the only other occasions on which the Lord used this phrase to denote his own people). <span class="cmt_word">But now</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a> and John 15:22, is logical, not temporal); <span class="accented">i.e. But seeing that it is so - <span class="cmt_word"></span>my kingdom</span>, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">is not from hence</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, and suggests that the kingdom derives its re sources and its energies "from the upper world, from above." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:33-40 Art thou the King of the Jews? that King of the Jews who has been so long expected? Messiah the Prince; art thou he? Dost thou call thyself so, and wouldest thou be thought so? Christ answered this question with another; not for evasion, but that Pilate might consider what he did. He never took upon him any earthly power, never were any traitorous principles or practices laid to him. Christ gave an account of the nature of his kingdom. Its nature is not worldly; it is a kingdom within men, set up in their hearts and consciences; its riches spiritual, its power spiritual, and it glory within. Its supports are not worldly; its weapons are spiritual; it needed not, nor used, force to maintain and advance it, nor opposed any kingdom but that of sin and Satan. Its object and design are not worldly. When Christ said, I am the Truth, he said, in effect, I am a King. He conquers by the convincing evidence of truth; he rules by the commanding power of truth. The subjects of this kingdom are those that are of the truth. Pilate put a good question, he said, What is truth? When we search the Scriptures, and attend the ministry of the word, it must be with this inquiry, What is truth? and with this prayer, Lead me in thy truth; into all truth. But many put this question, who have not patience to preserve in their search after truth; or not humility enough to receive it. By this solemn declaration of Christ's innocence, it appears, that though the Lord Jesus was treated as the worst of evil-doers, he never deserved such treatment. But it unfolds the design of his death; that he died as a Sacrifice for our sins. Pilate was willing to please all sides; and was governed more by worldly wisdom than by the rules of justice. Sin is a robber, yet is foolishly chosen by many rather than Christ, who would truly enrich us. Let us endeavour to make our accusers ashamed as Christ did; and let us beware of crucifying Christ afresh.</body></html>
