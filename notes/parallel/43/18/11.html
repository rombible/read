This is the only instance of the occurrence of this familiar imagery in St. John. St. Peter's act is one of opposition to what Jesus Himself knew to be the will of the Father. There is in the words a tender trustfulness which robs the cup of all its bitterness--"The cup which My Father hath given Me." They are, as it were, an echo of the prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, which is not recorded by St. John. It is the Father to whom He has prayed, and solemnly committed the disciples (John 17); the Father whose presence never leaves Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-32.htm" title="Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.">John 16:32</a>); the Father into whose hands He is about from the cross to commend His Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - In Christ's reply there is no mention made of the miracle which followed, and yet the narrative is incomplete without it. Something must have restrained the baud and the high priest's own temple-watch from at once arresting Peter, if not the entire group. The characteristic touch, descriptive of our Lord's most Divine compassion, is in itself valuable, but it also accounts for the immunity of Peter. The solemn rebuke of Peter is full of Divine meaning, and is another link with the synoptic narrative of the agony. "Put up," or more literally, <span class="cmt_word">Cast the</span> <span class="cmt_word">sword into its sheath</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is the classical word; <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> more generally used of repository, receptacle, sepulcher, etc.); or into its hiding-place; bury it away (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in Matthew). Matthew adds a memorable saying, but is silent as to the deep Divine reason of the submission of our Lord to his fate. <span class="cmt_word">The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it</span>? This imagery recalls the Passion, through which we learn from the synoptists that our Lord had passed into a Divine patience and submission to the will of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). The use of this most remarkable phraseology recalls that which John too had heard from his lips in the sweat of his agony, and of which he and Peter were the principal witnesses. The supplementary character of the Gospel, though by no means sufficient to account for all the omissions and additions of this narrative, yet does explain very much. "Jesus is now of his own accord at the disposal of his enemies; his words have put a stop to all further steps taken for his defense" (Moulton). (See Introduction, pp. 106, 107.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-12 Sin began in the garden of Eden, there the curse was pronounced, there the Redeemer was promised; and in a garden that promised Seed entered into conflict with the old serpent. Christ was buried also in a garden. Let us, when we walk in our gardens, take occasion from thence to mediate on Christ's sufferings in a garden. Our Lord Jesus, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth and asked, Whom seek ye? When the people would have forced him to a crown, he withdrew, ch.</body></html>
