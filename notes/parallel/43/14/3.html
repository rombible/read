It does not imply uncertainty, but expresses that the fact is in the region of the future, which is clear to Him, and will unfold itself to them.<p><span class= "bld">I will come again, and receive you unto myself.</span>--This clause has been variously explained of the resurrection; of the death of individual disciples; of the spiritual presence of our Lord in the Church; of the coming again of the Lord in the <span class= "ital">Parousia</span> of the last day, when all who believe in Him shall be received unto Himself. The difficulty has arisen from taking the words "I will come again," as necessarily referring to the same time as those which follow--"I will receive you unto Myself," whereas they are in the present tense, and should be literally rendered, <span class= "ital">I am coming again.</span> They refer rather, as the same words refer when used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>, to His constant spiritual presence in their midst; whereas the reception of them to Himself is to be understood of the complete union which will accompany that spiritual presence; a union which will be commenced in this life, advanced by the death of individuals, and completed in the final coming again. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if I go and if I prepare a place for you</span> - a simple condition, soon to be realized by the event - <span class="cmt_word">I come again</span>; I am ever coming, as I am now about to explain to you, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in my resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16, 17</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the bestowment of the Comforter (Vers. 17, 25, 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>, etc.); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in the intimate relations which, through the power of the Spirit (Vers. 18, 23), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>shall prevail between us. I am coming to you, in my glory and power, and in my victory in you as well as for you over death and Hades, to receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. The full perspective of the Lord's approach to faithful souls is given in the extraordinary pregnancy of the "I am coming." Not until he comes m all his glory will the words be perfectly fulfilled; but the early Church, on the basis of communion with Christ himself in the power of his Spirit, expected that Christ had come and taken to himself one by one those who died in the faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>). Thus Stephen expected the Lord to receive his spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>); and the dying thief was to be <span class="accented">with him</span>, in Paradise; and Paul knew that to be from home, so far as body is concerned, was to be "at home or present with the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>). "To be with Christ" was "far better" than to labor on in the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). The highest thought of peace and love was to the apostles union and presence with Christ. Our Lord asserts here that by his very nearness to them he will make their heaven for them. How soon this wonderful idea spread among men! Within twenty years, Thessalonians were comforted about their pious dead, with the thought that they slept in Jesus, and would together with them be "forever with the Lord." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-11 Here are three words, upon any of which stress may be laid. Upon the word troubled. Be not cast down and disquieted. The word heart. Let your heart be kept with full trust in God. The word your. However others are overwhelmed with the sorrows of this present time, be not you so. Christ's disciples, more than others, should keep their minds quiet, when everything else is unquiet. Here is the remedy against this trouble of mind, Believe. By believing in Christ as the Mediator between God and man, we gain comfort. The happiness of heaven is spoken of as in a father's house. There are many mansions, for there are many sons to be brought to glory. Mansions are lasting dwellings. Christ will be the Finisher of that of which he is the Author or Beginner; if he have prepared the place for us, he will prepare us for it. Christ is the sinner's Way to the Father and to heaven, in his person as God manifest in the flesh, in his atoning sacrifice, and as our Advocate. He is the Truth, as fulfilling all the prophecies of a Saviour; believing which, sinners come by him the Way. He is the Life, by whose life-giving Spirit the dead in sin are quickened. Nor can any man draw nigh God as a Father, who is not quickened by Him as the Life, and taught by Him as the Truth, to come by Him as the Way. By Christ, as the Way, our prayers go to God, and his blessings come to us; this is the Way that leads to rest, the good old Way. He is the Resurrection and the Life. All that saw Christ by faith, saw the Father in Him. In the light of Christ's doctrine, they saw God as the Father of lights; and in Christ's miracles, they saw God as the God of power. The holiness of God shone in the spotless purity of Christ's life. We are to believe the revelation of God to man in Christ; for the works of the Redeemer show forth his own glory, and God in him.</body></html>
