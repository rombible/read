Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.">John 16:23</a>. The prayer is thought of as addressed to the Father; but the answer here, and still more emphatically in the following verse, is thought of as coming from the Son, who is one with the Father. The width and limitation of the promise are both to be noted. It is "<span class= "ital">whatsoever</span> ye shall ask," and it is "ask <span class= "ital">in My name</span>." This means, as My representatives on earth (comp. Notes on previous verse), as persons doing My work, living in My spirit, seeking as I have sought to do the will of the Father. It follows from this that personal petitions are not contemplated here, except as far as they are for the glory of God; and that petitions asked in ignorance may be most truly answered when they are not granted. The prayer of Gethsemane--"If it be possible, let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless, not My will, but Thine be done," should teach what prayer in the name and spirit of Christ means. We commonly attach to our prayers, "through Jesus Christ our Lord." We do not always bear in mind that this implies an absolute self-sacrifice, and is a prayer that our very prayers may not be answered except in so far as they are in accordance with the divine will. (Comp.

Whether that be so or not, the power of their hands to perform these greater works is in answer to prayer presented to himself, and their success is nothing less than his own activity. <span class="cmt_word">And whatsoever ye ask in my Name, that will I do</span> (see Luther). Here for the first time our Lord uses these words. Frequently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25</a>) he had spoken of the <span class="accented">Father's Name</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> occurs; but now he suggests a new and vitalizing condition of prayer. Luthardt has suggested that the believer, being "in Christ," prays to the Father, who is also in Christ. But the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is used here in two entirely distinct senses. Others have said, taking "Name" as the compendium of all his perfections, that asking "in his Name" meant in full recognition of his Person and his relation to them and to the Father. The Name of the Son reveals the Father, and by assuming this most excellent Name, and having its fullness of meaning avouched by the Resurrection and Ascension, the Father was truly manifested. Others, again, urge that Christ's "Name" is equivalent to "himself;" and "in my Name" means "in the full consciousness that he is the element in which prayerful activity lives and moves" (Meyer). Surely this passage is the true justification of prayer to Christ himself, as identically one with the Father (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>). "This thing I will do" is strongly in favor of this interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">That the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> The end of this prayer-offering and the Lord's response is that the <span class="accented">Father</span> may be glorified; the Father who has such a Son is thereby glorified in the grateful love of his children, and <span class="accented">in the Son himself</span>, who is seen thus to be the link between him and his other children. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:12-17 Whatever we ask in Christ's name, that shall be for our good, and suitable to our state, he shall give it to us. To ask in Christ's name, is to plead his merit and intercession, and to depend upon that plea. The gift of the Spirit is a fruit of Christ's mediation, bought by his merit, and received by his intercession. The word used here, signifies an advocate, counsellor, monitor, and comforter. He would abide with the disciples to the end of time; his gifts and graces would encourage their hearts. The expressions used here and elsewhere, plainly denote a person, and the office itself includes all the Divine perfections. The gift of the Holy Ghost is bestowed upon the disciples of Christ, and not on the world. This is the favour God bears to his chosen. As the source of holiness and happiness, the Holy Spirit will abide with every believer for ever.</body></html>
