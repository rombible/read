Even more than this, <span class="cmt_word">because I live though I die, ye shall live also</span>, in your intense spiritual apperception of my continuity of life, of which you will have ocular and spiritual guarantee. Jesus here passed over the concrete fact of the Resurrection, to return to it afterwards. We know that the resurrection of his body and his victory over death became <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the condition of his sending the Spirit, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the proof of his being the living One whom death could not hold, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the ground of the higher appreciation of the relation they sustained to him. But he fixed their attention on his continuous life (in spite of death), and their consequent life under the shadow of his Divine protection, without specifically mentioning the Resurrection, of which he had (in synoptic narrative) given them explicit but misapprehended prophecies. This version seems to be preferable to making the last clause <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., a reason of the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> - a view advocated as possible by Meyer and Luthardt; or than the view which limits the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;</span> to the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>: "Ye see me because I live, and as a consequence of this vision ye shall live also." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:18-24 Christ promises that he would continue his care of his disciples. I will not leave you orphans, or fatherless, for though I leave you, yet I leave you this comfort, I will come to you. I will come speedily to you at my resurrection. I will come daily to you in my Spirit; in the tokens of his love, and visits of his grace. I will come certainly at the end of time. Those only that see Christ with an eye of faith, shall see him for ever: the world sees him no more till his second coming; but his disciples have communion with him in his absence. These mysteries will be fully known in heaven. It is a further act of grace, that they should know it, and have the comfort of it. Having Christ's commands, we must keep them. And having them in our heads, we must keep them in our hearts and lives. The surest evidence of our love to Christ is, obedience to the laws of Christ. There are spiritual tokens of Christ and his love given to all believers. Where sincere love to Christ is in the heart, there will be obedience. Love will be a commanding, constraining principle; and where love is, duty follows from a principle of gratitude. God will not only love obedient believers, but he will take pleasure in loving them, will rest in love to them. He will be with them as his home. These privileges are confined to those whose faith worketh by love, and whose love to Jesus leads them to keep his commandments. Such are partakers of the Holy Spirit's new-creating grace.</body></html>
