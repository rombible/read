This verse points out the successive degrees which led up to the full manifestation of Christ. The first step is the moral apprehension and practical observance of our Lord's commandments, which necessarily result from love to Christ.<p><span class= "bld">He it is that loveth me.</span>--The next step is the special receptivity of the Father's love which he who loves Christ possesses, and therefore there is a special sense in which the Father loves him. The words express with fulness of emphasis, "<span class= "ital">He</span> it is, and he only."<p><span class= "bld">And I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</span>--The special love of the Son follows from the special love of the Father, and is accompanied by the full manifestation of the Son. This is further explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - Then for a moment he turns from the eleven, and stretches out his searching gaze and far-sweeping love to every one who <span class="cmt_word">hath my commandments</span> as a sure possession and lofty privilege and sufficient standard, <span class="cmt_word">and keepeth them</span>, thus proving that <span class="cmt_word">he it is that loveth me</span>; returning thus back to Ver. 15, where he said that love would induce and ought to compel to obedience; and he adds another and wonderful benediction: <span class="cmt_word">He will be loved by my Father</span>, in a sense more intense than that in which God is said to love the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). God the Father loves those who love the Son, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> love the object of his own superlative affection. But who can this wondrous Being be who adds, as a climax of privilege and honor, as though it were more even than the love of the Father, <span class="cmt_word">I will love him, and will manifest myself in him</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>), not merely "disclose an undiscovered presence" or make evident a hidden glory, but I will take special means to disclose my Person and nature and goodness to him? Christ will do this to those who have and keep his commandments of self-forgetting love and perfect consecration. This remarkable word, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, implies that the scene and place of the higher manifestation will be "<span class="accented">in"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>) the consciousness of the soul. "The kingdom of God is within men. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:18-24 Christ promises that he would continue his care of his disciples. I will not leave you orphans, or fatherless, for though I leave you, yet I leave you this comfort, I will come to you. I will come speedily to you at my resurrection. I will come daily to you in my Spirit; in the tokens of his love, and visits of his grace. I will come certainly at the end of time. Those only that see Christ with an eye of faith, shall see him for ever: the world sees him no more till his second coming; but his disciples have communion with him in his absence. These mysteries will be fully known in heaven. It is a further act of grace, that they should know it, and have the comfort of it. Having Christ's commands, we must keep them. And having them in our heads, we must keep them in our hearts and lives. The surest evidence of our love to Christ is, obedience to the laws of Christ. There are spiritual tokens of Christ and his love given to all believers. Where sincere love to Christ is in the heart, there will be obedience. Love will be a commanding, constraining principle; and where love is, duty follows from a principle of gratitude. God will not only love obedient believers, but he will take pleasure in loving them, will rest in love to them. He will be with them as his home. These privileges are confined to those whose faith worketh by love, and whose love to Jesus leads them to keep his commandments. Such are partakers of the Holy Spirit's new-creating grace.</body></html>
