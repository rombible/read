Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-17.htm" title="Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.">John 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-10.htm" title="If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.">John 15:10</a>. The connection here is through the condition "in My name," which includes willing obedience to His commands. The word "My" is emphatic--"The commandments which ye have received from Me." Those of this last discourse are perhaps prominent in the thought.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye love me, keep</span> <span class="cmt_word">my commandments</span>. This great saying is enlarged on in the subsequent section - the relation of love to obedience, obedience producing love, and love suggesting obedience and supplying it with motive. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, "the commandments which are peculiarly mine" (see Westcott on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-9.htm">John 15:9</a>), "as either adopted and reuttered by <span class="accented">me</span>, or as originating in my new relation to you." "Guard them as a sacred deposit, obey them as the only reasonable response you can make to authoritative command." It is somewhat startling to find the great promise that follows conditioned by loving obedience, seeing that love and obedience in any sinful man, love to Christ itself, are elsewhere made the work of the Holy Spirit. But we here come across that which often perplexes the student, viz. the contrast between the general idea of the constant and continuous work of grace in human hearts, and the special manifestation in personal glory and Divine activity of the Holy Ghost on Pentecost. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:12-17 Whatever we ask in Christ's name, that shall be for our good, and suitable to our state, he shall give it to us. To ask in Christ's name, is to plead his merit and intercession, and to depend upon that plea. The gift of the Spirit is a fruit of Christ's mediation, bought by his merit, and received by his intercession. The word used here, signifies an advocate, counsellor, monitor, and comforter. He would abide with the disciples to the end of time; his gifts and graces would encourage their hearts. The expressions used here and elsewhere, plainly denote a person, and the office itself includes all the Divine perfections. The gift of the Holy Ghost is bestowed upon the disciples of Christ, and not on the world. This is the favour God bears to his chosen. As the source of holiness and happiness, the Holy Spirit will abide with every believer for ever.</body></html>
