We shall read then, "But, that the world may know that I love the Father, and that as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do, arise, let us go hence." He has asserted, in the previous verse, the sinlessness which makes His act wholly self-determined. He now expresses the subordination of His own to the Father's will, and summons the Apostles to rise up with Him from the table, and go forth from the room.<p><span class= "bld">But that the world . . .</span>--The words seem to point back to "the prince of this world" who has just been mentioned. The prince cometh, but it is to a defeat; and the very world over which he has ruled will see in the self-sacrifice of Jesus the love of the Father. That love will reclaim them from the bondage of the oppressor and restore them to the freedom of children.<p>It is an interesting question which we cannot hope with certainty to solve, whether or not in obedience to the command they went from the room at once. In other words, were the discourse of John 15, 16 and the prayer of John 17, uttered in the room after the summons to depart, or on the way to the garden of Gethsemane? The immediate connection of the opening words of the next chapter with the present verse naturally leads to the opinion that they were spoken in the same place, and, in the absence of any hint of a change, it is safe not to assume any. The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1</a> are probably those which express the act to which the words our Lord has just spoken summon them. But comp. <span class= "ital">Chronological Harmony of the Gospels,</span> p. xxxv.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But that</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is elliptical (Westcott translates, "But I surrender myself, that," etc.; and Meyer, "But he cometh, that," etc.), not dependent on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> - <span class="cmt_word">the world may know</span> - that very world over which this alien spirit has so long tyrannized may know, if not now, yet ultimately - <span class="cmt_word">that I love the Father</span>. Then it is the world which is to be nevertheless drawn to him by his being "lifted up "(John 12:52) - the world which the Father loves so much as to save and redeem from the power of the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">And even as the Father commanded me</span> - which is undoubtedly in harmony with the entire representation of the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> of the Father - so I do. My love is strong as death. Though the prince of the world has no right over me, I go at the Father's bidding to do his will, to suffer, but to win, and through death to destroy him that has the power of death. <span class="cmt_word">Arise, let us go hence</span> - words which are also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-46.htm">Matthew 26:46</a>, and are a touch of the eyewitness that nothing will obliterate. A second-century theologian would not have introduced such a feature. They leave the guest-chamber, and so the remainder of the discourse was delivered in the brightness of the Paschal moon, under shadow of the walls of Jerusalem, or in some corner of the temple area, or some convenient place on the way to Gethsemane. He said these words, however, before he crossed the Kedron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>). Apparently on the way thither he once more took up his parable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:28-31 Christ raises the expectations of his disciples to something beyond what they thought was their greatest happiness. His time was now short, he therefore spake largely to them. When we come to be sick, and to die, we may not be capable of talking much to those about us; such good counsel as we have to give, let us give while in health. Observe the prospect Christ had of an approaching conflict, not only with men, but with the powers of darkness. Satan has something in us to perplex us with, for we have all sinned; but when he would disturb Christ, he found nothing sinful to help him. The best evidence of our love to the Father is, our doing as he has commanded us. Let us rejoice in the Saviour's victories over Satan the prince of this world. Let us copy the example of his love and obedience.</body></html>
