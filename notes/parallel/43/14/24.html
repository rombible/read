He now shows how they could not be manifested to the hearts of the world. He that loveth not Christ keepeth not His word, and that word is the Father's. He has rejected the love of God which is revealed in the Son, and has Himself closed the channels of communion with God. God cannot dwell with him because there is in him nothing which can be receptive of the Divine Presence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - We have three statements about love and obedience: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Love involves obedience (Vers. 15, 23), or obedience naturally is included in love; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> obedience (having and keeping commandments) is the great proof of love (Ver. 21); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> (Ver. 24) "he that loveth not," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the absence or negation of love seems necessarily to forbid or discountenance obedience - the language differs slightly. <span class="cmt_word">He that loveth me not</span> <span class="cmt_word">keepeth not my words</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the various utterances into which my one <span class="accented">Word</span> may be subdivided in detail - and the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the one all-revealing <span class="cmt_word">Word</span>, out of which all the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> proceed, <span class="cmt_word">is not mine</span> (as self-originated), <span class="cmt_word">but is the Father's that sent me.</span> Without love to Christ the world has none of the conditions on which the self-manifestation of Christ really depends. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:18-24 Christ promises that he would continue his care of his disciples. I will not leave you orphans, or fatherless, for though I leave you, yet I leave you this comfort, I will come to you. I will come speedily to you at my resurrection. I will come daily to you in my Spirit; in the tokens of his love, and visits of his grace. I will come certainly at the end of time. Those only that see Christ with an eye of faith, shall see him for ever: the world sees him no more till his second coming; but his disciples have communion with him in his absence. These mysteries will be fully known in heaven. It is a further act of grace, that they should know it, and have the comfort of it. Having Christ's commands, we must keep them. And having them in our heads, we must keep them in our hearts and lives. The surest evidence of our love to Christ is, obedience to the laws of Christ. There are spiritual tokens of Christ and his love given to all believers. Where sincere love to Christ is in the heart, there will be obedience. Love will be a commanding, constraining principle; and where love is, duty follows from a principle of gratitude. God will not only love obedient believers, but he will take pleasure in loving them, will rest in love to them. He will be with them as his home. These privileges are confined to those whose faith worketh by love, and whose love to Jesus leads them to keep his commandments. Such are partakers of the Holy Spirit's new-creating grace.</body></html>
