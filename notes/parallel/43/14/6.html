"I, and none besides Me." "The way" is again made prominent, reversing the order which Thomas had used. He and He only is the means through which men can approach to the Father. (Comp.

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm" title="For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.">John 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-50.htm" title="This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.">John 6:50-51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25-26</a>.) Had they known what His earlier words meant, they would have had other than temporal and local thoughts of the Father's house, and would have known Him to be the Way.<p><span class= "bld">No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</span>--This was the answer to the doubt of Thomas. This was the true "whither" which they knew not. The thought of heaven is not of a place far above, or of a time far before, but of a state now and hereafter. To receive the Truth and the Life revealed in the presence of the Son is to come to the Father by the only Way. To be with the Father is home. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to him, I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had learned to know me, ye would have</span> <span class="cmt_word">known</span> (absolutely) <span class="cmt_word">my Father also: from henceforward ye know</span> (by personal experience) <span class="cmt_word">him, and</span> (or, perhaps, even) <span class="cmt_word">ye have seen him</span>. The whole sentence must be taken together. The <span class="accented">whither</span> of Christ is obvious enough, and throws consequent illumination upon the way thither. "The Father's house" is the <span class="accented">whither no one cometh unto the Father</span> (<span class="accented">but</span>) <span class="accented">except through me</span>. Christ explicitly says <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the entire goal of this wondrous way of his is the Father himself. From the Father he came, to the Father he was moving, not for his own sake only, but also as King Messiah for all his subjects. He suggests <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that mankind generally, as well as his disciples, are anxious to find their way to the Father's house, to the Father's heart, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to resting and rejoicing in God, and satisfaction in their entire conception of him and relation to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> He declares post-lively that this idea of God as Father, this approach to God for every man, is through him - through what he is and what he is doing and has so often described, for them. True, lie had said, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37, 44</a>, that the Father gave to him and drew towards him those who came to him. A fatherly monition and inward working of grace opened men's eyes in Christ to the mystery of true human son-ship of the eternal Father. The statement of this verse supplements the former utterance. They may best understand the way he is taking when they grasp the fact that he is going to the Father to prepare a place for them, and so he becomes "the Way, the Truth, the Life," for all who are coming after him, "following him afterwards" to the Father. Grotius sums up this great saying by regarding Christ as "the Exemplum, Doctor, et Dater vitro eternae;" Luther speaks of it as referring to the <span class="accented">past</span>, <span class="accented">present</span>, and <span class="accented">future</span>; Calvin, as "the Principium, Medium, et Finis;" and Augustine "vera vitae Via;" but each term means more than this. The <span class="accented">way</span> of approach to God is constituted by his simply being the incarnate Logos, by his revealing the mind and nature of God, by his laying down his life for the sheep that he might take it again. In doing this he supplies the method-and motive of holy living. It is not easy to say why our Lord should have added "the Truth and the Life." Maldonatus exclaimed, "Si Christus minus fuisset in respondendo liberalis, minus nobis in hujus loci interpretatione laborandum esset." The two further terms used by himself are probably introduced to throw light upon the way to the Father. Thus there are numerous assurances that he is <span class="accented">the Truth itself</span>, that is, the adequate and sufficient expression of Divine <span class="accented">thought</span>. "All the promises of God are <span class="accented">yea</span> [i.e. are uttered] and <span class="accented">Amen</span> [i.e. confirmed] in him." He is the absolute Truth <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> about God's nature; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the perfect Exponent of God's idea of humanity; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the Light of the world; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the Expression of the reality touching the relations between moral beings and God - all the relations, not only those of saints and holy angels, but those of rebels and sinners, whose destiny he has taken upon himself. <span class="accented">He is</span> the Way because he is the whole Truth about God and man and concerning the way to the Father. More than this, and because of this, he adds, "I am the Life" -"the <span class="accented">life eternal</span>," the Possessor, Author, Captain, Giver, and Prince of life - the life in the heart of man that can never die; the occasion, germ, condition, and force of the new lath. It were impossible to imagine higher claim. But he leaves his hearers without any doubt as to his personal and conscious identification of himself with the Father. Hitherto he had not so clearly unveiled himself as in that which he has here said and is now doing. Hence his nearest and dearest only partially knew him. If they had seen all they might have seen, they would have seen the Father also. Then, as though he would close all aperture to doubt about the glory involved in his humiliation, and the way in which his human life had revealed the Father, he says <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">- henceforward</span> this must be a fact of your consciousness, that <span class="accented">you do</span> learn and come to <span class="accented">know him</span> by personal experience (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); and as a matter of fact <span class="accented">ye have seen him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). Possibly in the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, involving the notion of a period rather than a moment, the Lord was including the full revelation of the glory of self-sacrificial love given alike in his death and resurrection. And the important thought is suggested that neither the knowledge of God can ever be complete, nor the vision either. Is Thomas answered or no? He is silent, and perhaps is pondering the words, which will lead him, before long, notwithstanding his doubts, to make the grandest confession contained in the entire Gospel, the answer of convinced though once skeptical humanity to the question, "Whom say ye that I am?" The other apostles feel that Christ's words have met the mystic vague fear of Thomas, and that "henceforward" they all belong with Christ to the Father's house. They would go to the Father, and at the right time dwell in the place prepared for them; but how can they be said to know and have seen the Father already - to have passed into the light or received the beatific vision? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-11 Here are three words, upon any of which stress may be laid. Upon the word troubled. Be not cast down and disquieted. The word heart. Let your heart be kept with full trust in God. The word your. However others are overwhelmed with the sorrows of this present time, be not you so. Christ's disciples, more than others, should keep their minds quiet, when everything else is unquiet. Here is the remedy against this trouble of mind, Believe. By believing in Christ as the Mediator between God and man, we gain comfort. The happiness of heaven is spoken of as in a father's house. There are many mansions, for there are many sons to be brought to glory. Mansions are lasting dwellings. Christ will be the Finisher of that of which he is the Author or Beginner; if he have prepared the place for us, he will prepare us for it. Christ is the sinner's Way to the Father and to heaven, in his person as God manifest in the flesh, in his atoning sacrifice, and as our Advocate. He is the Truth, as fulfilling all the prophecies of a Saviour; believing which, sinners come by him the Way. He is the Life, by whose life-giving Spirit the dead in sin are quickened. Nor can any man draw nigh God as a Father, who is not quickened by Him as the Life, and taught by Him as the Truth, to come by Him as the Way. By Christ, as the Way, our prayers go to God, and his blessings come to us; this is the Way that leads to rest, the good old Way. He is the Resurrection and the Life. All that saw Christ by faith, saw the Father in Him. In the light of Christ's doctrine, they saw God as the Father of lights; and in Christ's miracles, they saw God as the God of power. The holiness of God shone in the spotless purity of Christ's life. We are to believe the revelation of God to man in Christ; for the works of the Redeemer show forth his own glory, and God in him.</body></html>
