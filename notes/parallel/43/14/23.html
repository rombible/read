This is an answer to the question of Judas, the world in its unbelief and rejection of Christ's words, and without the spirit of love, could not receive this manifestation.<p><span class= "bld">We will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</span>--For the plural, comp.

The thought of God as dwelling in the sanctuary and among the people was familiar to the disciples from the Old Testament Scriptures (see, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-8.htm" title="And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-45.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.">Exodus 29:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/26-11.htm" title="And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-26.htm" title="Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the middle of them for ever more.">Ezekiel 37:26</a>), and the thought of the spiritual temple in the heart of man was not unknown to contemporary writers. Philo has a remarkable parallel in his treatise, <span class= "ital">De Cherubim,</span> p. 124, "Since therefore He (God) thus invisibly enters into the region of the soul, let us prepare that place, in the best way the case admits of, to be an abode worthy of God; for if we do not, He, without our being aware of it, will quit us and migrate to some other habitation which shall appear to Him to be more excellently provided" (Bohn's ed., vol. i., p. 199. See the whole of chap. 29). Sch�ttgen, in his note, quotes from a Rabbinical writer who says, "Blessed is the man who strives daily to make himself approved unto God, and prepares himself to receive the divine guest." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said to him, If a man,</span> let him be whosoever he may, love me - there is the germ and root of all - he will keep my Word (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). In Ver. 21 we see the complementary statement, "He that has and keeps my commandments loves me;" here, "He that loves me keeps my Word." In Ver. 21 obedience proves inward love, and may indicate to the world the fact of the Father's love and my own response. Here our Lord is laying down the principle of relation - the law of close intimacy, the conditions of higher knowledge. The keeping of the Word is a certain consequence of holy love. <span class="cmt_word">And my Father will love him.</span> So far Christ has only reiterated the great statement of Ver. 21, but instead of saying, "I will love him, and manifest myself," he added, <span class="cmt_word">We will come</span> - the Father and I - <span class="cmt_word">to him, and take up our abode</span>, make for ourselves a resting-place <span class="cmt_word">in his dwelling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>); cf. the analogous and wonderful parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>. There is a clear utterance of Divine self-consciousness. It is worthy of note that such an expression as this sounds a profounder depth of that consciousness than any phrase (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) already delivered. Apart from the stupendous corroborative facts elsewhere on record, this seems, to mere human experience, either awfully true or infinitely blasphemous. <span class="accented">The Father add</span> g will come together in the power of the Spirit, and we will dwell within the loving and obedient soul. This phrase suggests the mystical union of the Divine Personality with that of those who have entered into spiritual relation with Christ through love and obedience. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:18-24 Christ promises that he would continue his care of his disciples. I will not leave you orphans, or fatherless, for though I leave you, yet I leave you this comfort, I will come to you. I will come speedily to you at my resurrection. I will come daily to you in my Spirit; in the tokens of his love, and visits of his grace. I will come certainly at the end of time. Those only that see Christ with an eye of faith, shall see him for ever: the world sees him no more till his second coming; but his disciples have communion with him in his absence. These mysteries will be fully known in heaven. It is a further act of grace, that they should know it, and have the comfort of it. Having Christ's commands, we must keep them. And having them in our heads, we must keep them in our hearts and lives. The surest evidence of our love to Christ is, obedience to the laws of Christ. There are spiritual tokens of Christ and his love given to all believers. Where sincere love to Christ is in the heart, there will be obedience. Love will be a commanding, constraining principle; and where love is, duty follows from a principle of gratitude. God will not only love obedient believers, but he will take pleasure in loving them, will rest in love to them. He will be with them as his home. These privileges are confined to those whose faith worketh by love, and whose love to Jesus leads them to keep his commandments. Such are partakers of the Holy Spirit's new-creating grace.</body></html>
