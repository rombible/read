This shows that, while the disciples are to approach the Father "in the Name," in the fullness of perfection involved in the filial Name of Jesus, so the Father sends the Paraelete in the same Name, in the full recognition of Christ as the Sphere of all his gracious work. Meyer emphasizes by it the <span class="accented">Name</span> of Jesus; "<span class="accented">in</span> my Name," say Grotius, Lucke; "at my intercession" or "in my stead" (Tholuck, Ewald); "as my Representative" (Watkins). But the great Name of Jesus is "<span class="accented">the</span> Son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-5</a>). In the Sonship which he realized and displayed, the Father himself was manifested. The Spirit is sent from the Father fully to reveal the Son, while the substance of the teaching and meaning of the life of our Lord, in his Divine training of souls revealed the Father. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a masculine and emphatic pronoun, which gives personal quality and dignity to the Spirit, and points to all that is here predicated of his agency) <span class="cmt_word">shall teach you all things</span> that you need to know over and above what I have said (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>), and he will assist you to know more than you do now. <span class="cmt_word">He shall remind you of the all things which I have said to you.</span> The teaching of Christ, according to St. John's own statement, was vastly more extensive than all that had been recorded, the impression produced far deeper than anything that could be measured; yet even this would have been evaporated into vague sentiment, if the veritable things, the marvelous and incomparable wisdom, uttered by the Lord had not, by the special teaching of the Spirit, been re-communicated to the apostles by extraordinary refreshment of memory. The supernatural energy of the memory of the apostles, and their profound insight, is the basis of the New Testament, and the fulfillment of this promise. This sacred training will not teach specifically new truths, because the germinant form of all spiritual truth had been communicated by Christ; nor would the instruction create a fundamental deposit of tradition as yet unrevealed; nor is it to be such an intensification or addition to things already said as to contradict the teaching of the Lord; but the Holy Spirit will bring to the remembrance of the apostles all that the living Logos had spoken. Hence the mystic, the traditionist, and the rationalist cannot find support for their theses in these great words. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, however, gives a bright hint of the completeness of the equipment of the apostles for their work. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:25-27 Would we know these things for our good, we must pray for, and depend on the teaching of the Holy Ghost; thus the words of Jesus will be brought to our remembrance, and many difficulties be cleared up which are not plain to others. To all the saints, the Spirit of grace is given to be a remembrancer, and to him, by faith and prayer, we should commit the keeping of what we hear and know. Peace is put for all good, and Christ has left us all that is really and truly good, all the promised good; peace of mind from our justification before God. This Christ calls his peace, for he is himself our Peace. The peace of God widely differs from that of Pharisees or hypocrites, as is shown by its humbling and holy effects.</body></html>
