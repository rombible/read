Their sorrow at His departure was at its root selfish, as all sorrow for those who depart to be with God is, however little we think so. His departure would be the return to the glory of the Father's throne, and was matter for joy and not for sorrow. For them also it was expedient. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-6.htm" title="But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.">John 16:6-7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For my Father is greater than I.</span>--These words have naturally formed the subject of controversy in every period of the Church's history, between those who deny and those who accept the truth that the Son is "very God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before all worlds." And, as in all controversies, statements have been made on either side which cannot be supported by the words themselves. On the part of those who assert the divine nature, it has been contended that the Father is greater than the Son only as regards the human nature of the Son; but this is not here thought of. In this passage, as in others of the New Testament, it is plainly asserted that in the divine nature there is a subordination of the Son to the Father. (See, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm" title="And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.">1Corinthians 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet. But when he said all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.">1Corinthians 15:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm" title="And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.">Philippians 2:11</a>; and especially Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) On the part of those who deny the divinity of our Lord, it has been contended that this text asserts the inferiority of His nature to that of the Father, whereas the words could only have been uttered by one who meant in them to assert His own divine essence. If we try to imagine a man saying, "God is greater than I," we feel at once that He who really said them claimed for Himself that He was truly God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - Now, however, he leads them a step further. The disciples are to dismiss their trouble and fear, because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the many mansions that he is going to prepare; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because he was the "Way" to the Father; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because they have had a theophany in him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> because they shall carry on the work of Christ and fulfill all the prophecies, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> and do all this under the power of another Advocate or Helper; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> because he, the Holy Spirit, will indeed reveal him as he (Christ) had revealed the Father; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> because the Father and Son would come and take up their abode in the loving and obedient heart. But the Lord does more - he bids them not only to dismiss their fear and harassment, but even to "rejoice." <span class="cmt_word">Ye heard that I said, I am departing, and, in that very act, I am coming to you.</span> <span class="cmt_word">If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced</span> - a supposition involving uncertainty with a prospect of decision. Perfect love would cast out fear. But why? <span class="cmt_word">Because</span> <span class="cmt_word">I go to the Father</span>, the theme of the whole discourse. But why should this cause you to rejoice? <span class="cmt_word">Because the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father is greater than I!</span> It is not easy adequately to explain this memorable saying. The Arians made use of it to prove, from bur Lord's own lips, that his Person, even his pre-existent Divinity, was less than the Father's; that his essence, admittedly generated by the Father, was created by him, and was not the same as that of the Father. The same view has been held by the rationalistic school. The Socinians and modern Unitarians have insisted on the entire dependence and purely human character of our Lord. The Son of man and Son of God are to many merely the self-chosen titles of the greatest of the sons of men, who thus is supposed to put himself on a level with ordinary men who may learn to call God their Father. But is it? Could any man, unconscious of a far closer relation with God than that of the greatest saint, dare to say, as if to relieve anxiety on that head, "My Father is greater than I"? Is there not in the very phrase a suggestion of Divine sufficiency and relation to the Father which altogether precludes the purely humanitarian position? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> A theological view which has largely prevailed among those who have held the <span class="accented">homoousia</span> of the Father and the Son, is that the Lord was here speaking of his human nature only. The Athanasian symbol says," Equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood." But the "I" is here used of his whole Personality, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, and throughout the discourse he is speaking of himself in the Divine-human Person in which the eternal and temporal, the infinite and finite, are indissolubly blended. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others have supposed that he referred to himself as in a state of humiliation. Hengstenberg says the Lord was speaking of the pre-eminent greatness of the Father, which came to an end at his departure. Cyril, Luther, Melancthon, De Wette, Tholuck, Luthardt, and Alford think that Jesus spoke these words of the humiliated Christ in his condition of a servant - obedient unto death. The Son, the Logos of God, was that Mode or Personality of Deity by which "God" created the universe, governed mankind, and proceeded by special manifestation - incarnation, life, and death - to redeem the world. Calvin had said, while the Arians have abused this testimony, the orthodox solution of the Fathers was neither harmonious nor sound; the true signification of the passage, according to him, being found in the mediatorial office of the Christ, and in his <span class="accented">status exinanitionis</span>. But this would not exhaust the meaning, for in this very passage he does describe the Father as greater even than the <span class="accented">exalted</span> Christ; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-3</a> as greater even than the pre-existent Logos. And so <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> we are led to see that there is indeed a subordination of rank and order in the Son, involved in the very notion even of an eternal generation; and compatible with the equality of Being and of essence which he shared with the Father. This is undoubtedly confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; and has been through the whole history of Christological speculation conceded (Bishop Bull, in his three chapters on the "Subordination of the Son," has shown, by abundant proof, that before and after the Council of Nicaea, the Fathers held "that the Son has indeed the same Divine nature in common with the Father, but communicated by the Father in such sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the Father alone hath the Divine nature from himself, but the Son from the Father; that the Father is the Fountain, Origin, and Principle of the Divinity which is in the Son"). This is abundantly, needful to avoid at once the errors of tritheism, and to maintain the real unity of the Divine Being. Christ's going to the Father was a ground of rejoicing, because his exaltation through death and resurrection to the position of power and majesty unutterable, and the lifting up of his Divine-human Personality to the midst of the throne, gives to him, in his relations with his disciples, the efficacy of the greatness of that Divine nature which, by its own characteristics, could not have become incarnate. The unrevealed God is greater than the revealed. The lifting up of perfect humanity into the glory which the Son had with the Father before the world was, should have been the cause of joy to the disciples. It is the wellspring of joy to the Church (see Suicer, 'Thesaurus,' art. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>; Bull's 'Defense of the Nicene Creed,' bk. 4; Westcott's catena of passages in 'Additional Note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14.htm">John 14</a>;' Lange and P. Schaff, 'Comm. on John'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:28-31 Christ raises the expectations of his disciples to something beyond what they thought was their greatest happiness. His time was now short, he therefore spake largely to them. When we come to be sick, and to die, we may not be capable of talking much to those about us; such good counsel as we have to give, let us give while in health. Observe the prospect Christ had of an approaching conflict, not only with men, but with the powers of darkness. Satan has something in us to perplex us with, for we have all sinned; but when he would disturb Christ, he found nothing sinful to help him. The best evidence of our love to the Father is, our doing as he has commanded us. Let us rejoice in the Saviour's victories over Satan the prince of this world. Let us copy the example of his love and obedience.</body></html>
