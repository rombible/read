If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.">John 14:28</a>), and it is natural therefore to understand these words as suggested by the common Oriental formulas of leave-taking. Men said to each other when they met and parted, "Shalom! Shalom!" (Peace! Peace!) just as they say the "Salaam! Salaam!" in our own day. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-17.htm" title="Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him.">1Samuel 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-50.htm" title="And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.">Luke 7:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-36.htm" title="And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.">Acts 16:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-16.htm" title="And one of you say to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body; what does it profit?">James 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-23.htm" title="Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Ephesians 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-14.htm" title="Greet you one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.">1Peter 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-14.htm" title="But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends salute you. Greet the friends by name.">3John 1:14</a>.)<p>He will leave them as a legacy the gift of "peace." And this peace is more than a meaningless sound or even than a true wish. He repeats it with the emphatic "My," and speaks of it as an actual possession which He imparts to them. "Peace on earth" was the angels' message when they announced His birth; "peace to you" was His own greeting when He returned victorious from the grave. "He is our peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>), and this peace is the farewell gift to the disciples from whom He is now departing. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.">John 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm" title="These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.">John 16:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.">John 20:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-26.htm" title="And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the middle, and said, Peace be to you.">John 20:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</span>--The contrast is not between the emptiness of the world's salutations and the reality of His own gift, but between His legacy to them and the legacies ordinarily left by the world. He gives them not land or houses or possessions, but "peace;" and that "His own peace," "the peace of God which passeth all understanding."<p><span class= "bld">Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</span>--These are in part the words of the first verse, and are now repeated as a joyous note of triumph. Possessing the peace which He gives them, having another Advocate in the person of the Holy Spirit, having the Father and the Son ever abiding in them, there cannot be, even when He is about to leave them, room for trouble or for fear.<p>The word here rendered "be afraid<span class= "ital">"</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It points especially to the cowardice of fear. The cognate substantive is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-7.htm" title="For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.">2Timothy 1:7</a>, and the adjective in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm" title="And he said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.">Matthew 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-40.htm" title="And he said to them, Why are you so fearful? how is it that you have no faith?">Mark 4:40</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - "Then follow the last words as of one who is about to go away, and says 'Good night,' or gives his blessing" (Luther). <span class="cmt_word">Peace I leave with</span> (or, <span class="accented">to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>you</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Peace</span> (d<span class="greek">&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) answers to the (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>) <span class="accented">shalom</span> of ordinary converse and greeting, and signifies prosperity, health of soul, serenity, farewell. This is the sacred bestowment and Divine legacy of the Lord. "Peace" is always the result of equilibrated forces, the poise of antagonistic elements, held in check by one another. Of these the most placid lake, hidden in the hills and reflecting the sunshine and shadows, is a remarkable illustration. So the peace Christ leaves is <span class="accented">power to</span> hold the wildest fear in pause, to still a clamor or hush a cry - it is the coming of mercy to a sense of sin, of life to the fear of death. But when he added, <span class="cmt_word">The peace that is mine I give to you</span>, we are reminded of the tremendous conflict going on in his own nature at that very moment, and of the sublime secret of Jesus, by which the will of man was brought, even in agony and death, into utter harmony with the will of God. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> of this verse show how the ordinary salutation may become invested with immense significance. There are moments when into one human word may be condensed the love of a lifetime. Christ does but pour through these common words the fire of his eternal and infinite love. <span class="cmt_word">Not as the world giveth, give I to you</span>, both as to manner and matter and power. The mode of giving is <span class="accented">real</span>, sincere, neither formal nor hypocritical. "I say it, and I mean it." (Meyer, in opposition to Coder, thinks this unworthy of the Savior at this moment; but Godet is right.) The matter, substance, and value of the prosperity and peace I give stretches out into eternity; and <span class="accented">I give</span> it, I do not merely talk of it or wish it. "Christ's farewell greeting is forerunner of the beatific salutation which shall accompany the eternal meeting" (Lange). Then, returning to the Divine words of Ver. 1, he seems to say, "Have I not justified all that I have said?" - <span class="cmt_word">Let not your heart be troubled</span>, harassed by these mysteries or by my departure, <span class="cmt_word">neither let it be terrified</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>). This is the only place in the New Testament where the word occurs, though it is found in the LXX.; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense of timidity from extrinsic fear, may frequently be found. He must have seen some rising symptoms of the carnal weakness which would prostrate them for a while. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:25-27 Would we know these things for our good, we must pray for, and depend on the teaching of the Holy Ghost; thus the words of Jesus will be brought to our remembrance, and many difficulties be cleared up which are not plain to others. To all the saints, the Spirit of grace is given to be a remembrancer, and to him, by faith and prayer, we should commit the keeping of what we hear and know. Peace is put for all good, and Christ has left us all that is really and truly good, all the promised good; peace of mind from our justification before God. This Christ calls his peace, for he is himself our Peace. The peace of God widely differs from that of Pharisees or hypocrites, as is shown by its humbling and holy effects.</body></html>
