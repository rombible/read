He has spoken of the future of those who are true to their commission as Apostles. He now turns in deep emotion to him of whom those words cannot be spoken. The "Verily, verily," and the three verbs, "was troubled," "bare witness," "spake," perhaps imply that there was a pause in which His feeling checked His words, but that the witness to the truth demanded that they should be spoken, painful as they were. For the words themselves, comp.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-18.htm">Mark 14:18</a> corresponds and finds its explanation in the scene described by John, as also his quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>. It does not follow, because the synoptics omit the "feet-washing," that they were ignorant of it; John's purpose was to record that which they had omitted. On the other hand, John does give some very significant indications of the same general current of inner life in the mind of Jesus and of the twelve. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>) shows that at this very moment Judas had so far given way to his avarice, impatience, disappointment, and innate pride and selfishness, as to be simply seeking his opportunity to betray his Master in the absence of the multitude. He had his price; he was meditating treachery. Granting the mixture of motive which may have agitated him, we condemn the pleading of numerous modern writers, who almost extenuate his malice and represent him as victim of the violent vulgar passion of the multitude for a triumphant secular Messiah. Every touch or stroke in the evangelic narrative shows how utterly Impervious to goodness the traitor really was; and John gives us a further hint, in addition to that supplied by the synoptists, as to the very commencement of the agony, the details of which they prolong into the night. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus was troubled in the spirit</span> (cf. notes on John 11:33). This is one of the strongest expressions used of the sorrows of Christ; the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;</span> even was deeper down in his nature than what is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, of Matthew. The distress penetrated from "body" to "soul," and then to inmost "spirit." The Lord was terribly perturbed, not merely with approaching agony aggravated by treachery and desertion, but by the contrast between his love and the issue, between an apostle and his doom. <span class="cmt_word">And he testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you</span>. A close specification of coming events takes the place of the more vague utterances of vers. 17-19. <span class="cmt_word">One of</span> <span class="cmt_word">you shall betray me</span>. The synoptic account introduces the vivid scene of humble and heart-.rending inquiry, "Lord, is it I?" to which the reply was made, "The one that dippeth his hand in the dish with me shall betray me," followed by a still more awful warning, and imprecation calling the self-consciously guilty man to hesitate, to pause for his own sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-24.htm">Matthew 26:24</a>). And, further, we learn that Judas received the answer, unheard by his fellow-disciples that it was he who was in this imminent danger. This scene, however, was so impressive to the majority that the synoptic tradition failed to record a briefer side-scene, of which John was the principal witness, and which he here describes. <span class="cmt_word">The disciples</span> (<span class="cmt_word">therefore</span>) <span class="cmt_word">were gazing on one another, being in perplexity concerning whom he spake</span>. They were looking on in mute or whispering amazement and tribulation upon one another, being in sore bewilderment (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), but as yet they did not suspect Judas. <span class="cmt_word">There was lying</span>, says our text, reclining at the table, <span class="cmt_word">in the bosom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>) - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "against the breast" - <span class="cmt_word">one of his disciples whom Jesus loved.</span> Observe, this sacred designation occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7, 20</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a> it is "the other disciple whom Jesus <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">amabat</span>, implying that the love of Jesus was not confined to John, but embraced Peter also; whereas <span class="accented">here</span> we have <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>, the higher love of respect and affection, <span class="accented">diligebat</span>. We can have no doubt, from the enumeration of the group in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>, etc., that it is one of Zebedee's sons. Now one of these, James, as we learn from the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>, soon passed away. The author of the Fourth Gospel does undoubtedly mean to refer to John, and to represent the disciple <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> as no other than himself. The <span class="accented">attitude</span> so carefully described had been adopted by the Jews at table. It shows that John was seated, or was reclining, next to Jesus on his right, and therefore could, more easily than his next companion on the left, have sought and received an answer from the Lord. Whether this was Peter or Judas does not appear certain. Edersheim has represented Peter's place as on the opposite side of the horseshoe table. Words from that distance could have been overheard by all. At the celebration of the Passover, the guests were accustomed originally to <span class="accented">stand</span>; but after the Captivity the custom fell into desuetude. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:18-30 Our Lord had often spoken of his own sufferings and death, without such trouble of spirit as he now discovered when he spake of Judas. The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles. Those whose deeds are evil, love darkness rather than light.</body></html>
