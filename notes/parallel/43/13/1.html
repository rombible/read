If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.">John 11:9</a>.) Now He knows with equal certainty that the hour is at hand that He should depart unto the Father. Having loved his own which were in the world . . .--By "his own" are here meant those who by believing on Him had received power to become the sons of God; those who by walking according as they had light were becoming sons of light. They are the true members, of the family of God. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11-12</a>.) The words as here used refer specially to those who had been called by Him, and had left all and followed Him. He is the head of this family, and He knows that these His "little children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm" title="Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.">John 13:33</a>) will be left as orphans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>). He would depart "out of the world;" they would be left "in the world," as sheep among wolves, and as sheep without their shepherd. St. John places these facts in touching contrast. His thoughts are for them and not for Himself. For Him there would be the return to the glory of His Father's throne, but His mind dwells on the bereavement and sorrow of those He leaves behind, and this moves Him to a special manifestation of His love.<p><span class= "bld">He loved them unto the end</span>--It has been usual to explain these words of the continuance of our Lord's love--"Having loved His own, He continued to love them until the last moment." This is, of course, true, but is a truth so certain and necessary from every conception of our Lord's character as St. John has portrayed it, that we may doubt whether he would in this formal way state it. And though the phrase rendered "unto the end" sometimes means "finally"--as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-5.htm" title="Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.">Luke 18:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1Thessalonians 2:16</a> (see Notes)--the sense, "unto the end" is very rare, and the general meaning is, "in the fullest degree," "up to the limit." It thus answers exactly to our "extremely."<p>What seems not to have been noted is that the whole sentence may be a common Hebrew idiom in Greek dress. It belongs to the simple syntax of a primitive people to express intensity by repetition. The Vale of Sodom was "pits, pits of bitumen "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-10.htm" title="And the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.">Genesis 14:10</a>). Esau asked Jacob to feed him with "that red, red, thing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-30.htm" title="And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.">Genesis 25:30</a>). The intensity of the verbal idea was expressed in like manner by a simple form of the verb which brought the thought before the mind, and then by the special form which denoted the action. This is sometimes preserved in the English, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-17.htm" title="So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children.">Genesis 20:17</a>--"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed" (I will bless thee abundantly, and will multiply thy seed exceedingly). Sometimes it is not. We have, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-8.htm" title="Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, said the LORD.">Amos 9:8</a>, "I will not <span class= "ital">utterly</span> destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord," where the Hebrew is literally, "Destroying I will not destroy . . . (Vulgate, <span class= "ital">conter ens non conter am</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In these passages the English exactly follows the Greek--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Greek in the passage of Genesis repeats the words as the Hebrew does, and in that of Amos, expresses the intensity by an adverbial phrase (<span class= "greekheb">?is ?????</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Now that phrase is exactly the same as the one used by St. John here, and which is rendered "unto the end." St. John was a Jew writing in Greek. May we not naturally expect a Hebrew thought in Greek form? He thinks of the intensity of our Lord's love, and speaks of it in the simple expressiveness of the old Hebrew phrase, "Loving, he loved them with fulness of love." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm" title="Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.">John 12:13</a>.) This is not given as an amended rendering, because authority has been sought for it without success; but it is offered, as an explanation, to the reader's judgment. The student will find in Schleusner s <span class= "ital">Lexicon Veteris Testamenti</span> other instances which support this view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-17.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">Love in humiliation</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now before the Feast of the Passover</span>; a phrase far more applicable to the 13-14th of Nisan than to the 14-15th, even though the Lord was desiring then to eat the Passover with a great desire before he suffered; therefore "before" the Passion, which would coincide with it. This supplies a chronological note, which is not exhausted by the mysterious and pathetic act which is described, but embraces the entire communion of soul with his disciples, and with the Father in their presence, detailed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13.htm">John 13-17</a>. Commentators have differed greatly as to the reference of this phrase - whether to the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, as Kling and Luthardt, or to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as Wieseler and Tholuck; both these interpretations limit the meaning of the passage. Christ's knowledge that his hour was come was not kept from him till that moment, nor was his love to his own disciples limited or qualified by the advent of the Passover. It is far better, with Westcott, Coder, Meyer, and Lange, to take the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, with the principal verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. This becomes mere obvious if <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> be taken, as it generally is taken, in Greek, to mean "unto the uttermost," "absolutely" "perfectly." Godet and Lucke add to the idea of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> here the <span class="accented">manifestation</span>, or <span class="accented">proof</span>, of the intensity and tenderness of the Divine love. Meyer doubts this signification of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>. The whole of the intervening sentence is in apposition with the subject of the sentence. The evangelist was eye-withes of the manner and look of his Lord, and ventured to say what was passing in his mind. He was justified by what followed, and threw back into the spirit of this strange and solemn action the account which the Lord afterwards gave of himself. Throughout the whole passage we detect; the extraordinary blending of Divine and human of which John was the witness. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus knowing</span> (as he did know) <span class="cmt_word">that the hour was</span> <span class="cmt_word">come</span> - an hour for which he had been long waiting, and to which frequent reference has been made. The crisis has arrived, the breach with the authorities was final, the disciples themselves were trembling in doubt, the great law had been uttered, the glorification of the Son of man must now be accomplished by departure rather than by longer ministry, by death rather than by universal acclaim - <span class="cmt_word">that</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> here notes the Divine purpose, or what is not infrequently introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "the contemplated result" (see Canon Evans on "the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament," <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 3, 2nd series) - <span class="cmt_word">he</span>, Jesus, the Son of man, <span class="cmt_word">should depart out of this world</span> (this is one theme of the following discourse, one of its key-notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>, and many other passages) unto the Father. If so, death was not an ending of life, but a departure to the Father - a coming into closer and more intimate relations and communion with the Father than was possible, even for him, in this sinful and evil world. Frequently the demonstrative pronoun is used to designate this transitory, perilous, sad state of being. Further, Jesus <span class="cmt_word">having loved his own</span>, his very own, whom the Father had given him, <span class="cmt_word">who were</span> and would continue <span class="cmt_word">in the world</span>, and have tribulation there (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-1.htm">John 16:1-4, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11, 14, 18</a>), and all the more so because of his departure and the cessation of his earthly manifestation and ministry. Here the sentence ends with the climacteric expression, <span class="cmt_word">He loved them utterly</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he manifested, and that before the Paschal Lamb should be slain for them, his absolute, extreme, unutterable love. Archdeacon Watkins has made an interesting suggestion, that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> represents, in Greek, the Hebrew idiom of the repetition of the action of the verb; whereas the LXX. often presents this Hebraism in literal Greek, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-17.htm">Genesis 20:17</a>, yet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a> a similar reduplication is Grecized by the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and that what St. John, a Hebrew writing in Greek, meant by the use of it was simply," He loved them with a fullness of love." This usage is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>, by later Greek and by classical usage. It probably means in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-5.htm">Luke 18:5</a> "at last," but not necessarily so even there. Margin of Revised Version gives "to the uttermost." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-17 Our Lord Jesus has a people in the world that are his own; he has purchased them, and paid dear for them, and he has set them apart for himself; they devote themselves to him as a peculiar people. Those whom Christ loves, he loves to the end. Nothing can separate a true believer from the love of Christ. We know not when our hour will come, therefore what we have to do in constant preparation for it, ought never to be undone. What way of access the devil has to men's hearts we cannot tell. But some sins are so exceedingly sinful, and there is so little temptation to them from the world and the flesh, that it is plain they are directly from Satan. Jesus washed his disciples' feet, that he might teach us to think nothing below us, wherein we may promote God's glory, and the good of our brethren. We must address ourselves to duty, and must lay aside every thing that would hinder us in what we have to do. Christ washed his disciples' feet, that he might signify to them the value of spiritual washing, and the cleansing of the soul from the pollutions of sin. Our Lord Jesus does many things of which even his own disciples do not for the present know the meaning, but they shall know afterward. We see in the end what was the kindness from events which seemed most cross. And it is not humility, but unbelief, to put away the offers of the gospel, as if too rich to be made to us, or too good news to be true. All those, and those only, who are spiritually washed by Christ, have a part in Christ. All whom Christ owns and saves, he justifies and sanctifies. Peter more than submits; he begs to be washed by Christ. How earnest he is for the purifying grace of the Lord Jesus, and the full effect of it, even upon his hands and head! Those who truly desire to be sanctified, desire to be sanctified throughout, to have the whole man, with all its parts and powers, made pure. The true believer is thus washed when he receives Christ for his salvation. See then what ought to be the daily care of those who through grace are in a justified state, and that is, to wash their feet; to cleanse themselves from daily guilt, and to watch against everything defiling. This should make us the more cautious. From yesterday's pardon, we should be strengthened against this day's temptation. And when hypocrites are discovered, it should be no surprise or cause of stumbling to us. Observe the lesson Christ here taught. Duties are mutual; we must both accept help from our brethren, and afford help to our brethren. When we see our Master serving, we cannot but see how ill it becomes us to domineer. And the same love which led Christ to ransom and reconcile his disciples when enemies, still influences him.</body></html>
