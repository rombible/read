"Simon Peter therefore beckons," or, <span class= "ital">makes a sign.</span> We have to remember that these Apostles were both members of the first group, who are from some special characteristics nearer to our Lord than the others. They had both been disciples of the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40-41</a>), and we may think of them in the earlier as in the later work as in a special sense companions and friends. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm" title="Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.">Acts 4:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</span>--The better reading is, <span class= "ital">and saith unto him, Say who it is of whom He speaketh.</span> St. Peter supposes that the disciple whom Jesus loved is more than any other in the confidence of his Master, and that he knew who was here referred to, and makes a sign to him to tell what he knew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to this</span> (disciple), <span class="cmt_word">and saith to him.</span> Wherefore he must have been far enough off to beckon, and near enough to speak. Westcott imagines that Peter was on the <span class="accented">left</span> side, in the place of real honor (?), though not in such proximity as, unobserved, to ask the question. Edersheim also speaks of the <span class="accented">left</span> side as the place of honor, but assigns no adequate reason for such a violation of universal usage and metaphor. The natural impetuosity of Peter would have induced him, if he had been so near, to have asked the question himself. It is more probable that Judas himself was there, judging from the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>, and from the act which follows. Either with T.R., <span class="cmt_word">He spake to him, to ask who it might be</span>; <span class="cmt_word">or, saith, Tell</span> (<span class="cmt_word">us</span>) <span class="cmt_word">who it is concerning whom he speaks</span>; as though Peter had rushed to the conclusion that John knew. This is singularly like Peter, and John may tacitly have been supposed to be better acquainted than the rest with the mind of Jesus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:18-30 Our Lord had often spoken of his own sufferings and death, without such trouble of spirit as he now discovered when he spake of Judas. The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles. Those whose deeds are evil, love darkness rather than light.</body></html>
