The word impressed itself upon the mind of St. John, and it occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in his First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1John 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1John 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1John 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm" title="Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.">1John 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.">1John 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm" title="You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.">1John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm" title="Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.">1John 5:21</a>), and in an uncertain reading in the striking words of St. Paul, "My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you." (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>, and comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 371.)<p>For the remainder of the verse, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-33.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.">John 7:33-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus again to them, I go my way, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, you cannot come.">John 8:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - This is the first and only time, in the Gospels that the tender word, <span class="cmt_word">little children</span>, is used by the Lord (but compare <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-5.htm">John 21:5</a>, and the repeated adoption by John himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 12, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>; and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>). The adoption of the gentle love-word is appropriate as a link to the new commandment, and reveals the love of departure, the tender love that wells up in his heart, as he contemplates the orphan-like and bereft condition of his disciples. <span class="cmt_word">A little while am I still with you.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall seek me</span> in the way of sympathetic love and vivid realization of my spiritual and real presence; <span class="cmt_word">and as I said ante the Jews</span> (a term that Christ used in this place only when speaking to his disciples, though he had made use of it to the Samaritans, and would use it to Caiaphas and Pilate), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33, 34</a>, and John 8:21; but there and then he added, "Ye will not find me," because they would only seek him in carnal ideas and angry disappointment. Observe, he does not here repeat this consequence of the search, because ultimately these disciples would not only seek, but follow and find; nevertheless, he adds: As I said to the Jews, <span class="cmt_word">Whither I go, you are not able to come; so at this time I say to you.</span> There are two words used for "now" - <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> denotes absolutely the present moment; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-19.htm">John 9:19, 25</a>, etc.) denotes here and there, a <span class="accented">period</span> distinct from past and future, and yet related to both. The time is not yet come for you to enter into my glory; you cannot yet come, you have to continue my earthly ministry, to prolong the testimony which I have given concerning God, and which God has given concerning me. The time will come when "I will receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also;" but now he prays, "though I am no more in this world, these are in the world holy Father, keep them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 Christ had been glorified in many miracles he wrought, yet he speaks of his being glorified now in his sufferings, as if that were more than all his other glories in his humbled state. Satisfaction was thereby made for the wrong done to God by the sin of man. We cannot now follow our Lord to his heavenly happiness, but if we truly believe in him, we shall follow him hereafter; meanwhile we must wait his time, and do his work. Before Christ left the disciples, he would give them a new commandment. They were to love each other for Christ's sake, and according to his example, seeking what might benefit others, and promoting the cause of the gospel, as one body, animated by one soul. But this commandment still appears new to many professors. Men in general notice any of Christ's words rather than these. By this it appears, that if the followers of Christ do not show love one to another, they give cause to suspect their sincerity.</body></html>
