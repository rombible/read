Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.">John 8:51</a>. The incidental touches of character where individual apostles are named in this Gospel are in striking agreement with the more fully-drawn character of the other evangelists, and the value of their evidence for the authorship cannot be over-estimated. They are perfectly artless, but are beyond the most consummate art. We feel that it is the loving, impulsive, but self-confident Peter of the earlier Gospels who is speaking here. He does not wait for that after-knowledge which our Lord promises him. He sees no ground on which our Lord's act can possibly be one which he can permit. Note that the emphasis is on the negative. The pronoun "my" is again not to be emphasised, nor is "Thou" in this passage. "Thou shalt <span class= "ital">never</span> wash my feet."<p><span class= "bld">If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</span>--Our Lord has already intimated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-7.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.">John 13:7</a>) that His deed was symbolic, and He now refers to the truth underlying the outer act. The key to His meaning is to be found in His own words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-13.htm" title="You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.">John 13:13-17</a>. By the act of washing their feet, He, their Lord, taught the spirit of self-sacrifice and love in opposition to the spirit of self-seeking and pride which ruled even in the Apostles' hearts. That lesson every servant and apostle of Jesus Christ must learn, for the servant is. not greater than the Lord, nor the Apostle than the Sender. That lesson Peter was refusing to learn in the pride of his own impulsive will, which seemed to be humility. But unless he learns to accept the love of Christ's humiliation, and is so cleansed by its power that he yields his human will wholly to the divine, and learns in self-sacrifice what the spirit of Christ really is, he can have no part in Him. The lesson is a hard one, but it is necessary; the sacrifice of will may be harder than that of life; but the strong man must become as the little child before he can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.<p>For the phrase, "Thou hast no part with me," which is again a Hebrew thought in Greek dress, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-51.htm" title="And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.">Matthew 24:51</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-46.htm" title="The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looks not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.">Luke 12:46</a>. It is frequent in the Old Testament. See, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-12.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; for as much as he has no part nor inheritance with you.">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>, "He hath no part nor inheritance with you."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-17 Our Lord Jesus has a people in the world that are his own; he has purchased them, and paid dear for them, and he has set them apart for himself; they devote themselves to him as a peculiar people. Those whom Christ loves, he loves to the end. Nothing can separate a true believer from the love of Christ. We know not when our hour will come, therefore what we have to do in constant preparation for it, ought never to be undone. What way of access the devil has to men's hearts we cannot tell. But some sins are so exceedingly sinful, and there is so little temptation to them from the world and the flesh, that it is plain they are directly from Satan. Jesus washed his disciples' feet, that he might teach us to think nothing below us, wherein we may promote God's glory, and the good of our brethren. We must address ourselves to duty, and must lay aside every thing that would hinder us in what we have to do. Christ washed his disciples' feet, that he might signify to them the value of spiritual washing, and the cleansing of the soul from the pollutions of sin. Our Lord Jesus does many things of which even his own disciples do not for the present know the meaning, but they shall know afterward. We see in the end what was the kindness from events which seemed most cross. And it is not humility, but unbelief, to put away the offers of the gospel, as if too rich to be made to us, or too good news to be true. All those, and those only, who are spiritually washed by Christ, have a part in Christ. All whom Christ owns and saves, he justifies and sanctifies. Peter more than submits; he begs to be washed by Christ. How earnest he is for the purifying grace of the Lord Jesus, and the full effect of it, even upon his hands and head! Those who truly desire to be sanctified, desire to be sanctified throughout, to have the whole man, with all its parts and powers, made pure. The true believer is thus washed when he receives Christ for his salvation. See then what ought to be the daily care of those who through grace are in a justified state, and that is, to wash their feet; to cleanse themselves from daily guilt, and to watch against everything defiling. This should make us the more cautious. From yesterday's pardon, we should be strengthened against this day's temptation. And when hypocrites are discovered, it should be no surprise or cause of stumbling to us. Observe the lesson Christ here taught. Duties are mutual; we must both accept help from our brethren, and afford help to our brethren. When we see our Master serving, we cannot but see how ill it becomes us to domineer. And the same love which led Christ to ransom and reconcile his disciples when enemies, still influences him.</body></html>
