"He then leaning thus . . . ," describes the action just as it took place (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-6.htm" title="Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.">John 4:6</a>); but the balance of authority is against the insertion. The action is, however, exactly described in the original, for the words "lying" and "breast" are both different from those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>. The English preserves this difference, but hardly conveys the full meaning. There the beloved disciple is described as reclining towards his Master's bosom. Here he leans upon (or leans back upon, as many good authorities read), the Master's breast, and asks Him the question, "Who is it?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He, leaning back as he was against the breast of Jesus, saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</span> Meyer explains, "He, raising himself from the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of Jesus to his breast, nearer to his ear, draws close to him, and asks in a whisper." This turns on the special rendering given by Meyer and others to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as meaning the fold of the garment above the girdle, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>; but the fundamental meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is bosom, womb, embrace, and this secondary meaning need not be pressed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22, 23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:18-30 Our Lord had often spoken of his own sufferings and death, without such trouble of spirit as he now discovered when he spake of Judas. The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles. Those whose deeds are evil, love darkness rather than light.</body></html>
