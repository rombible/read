Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28</a>. The going out of Judas is the sign that the betrayal and death of the Son of Man was at hand. In that was the glory of His accomplished work, and He speaks of this glory as present. It lies so immediately before Him that it is at once realised; and the brightness of the vision over-powers all thought of the darkness of the path which leads to it.<p><span class= "bld">God is glorified in him.</span>--This is a re-statement of the thought which has met us whenever the work of the Son has been dwelt upon. It was the Father's work too. The glory of the Son of Man in the redemption of the world was the glory of God, who gave His only-begotten Son, that by Him the world might be saved. There is a contrast drawn here between the humanity and the divinity united in the person of our Lord. In Him, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in His person, in the person of the Son of Man suffering and crucified, there were manifested the attributes of the majesty and glory of God. It was an utterance to the world, in a fulness never heard before, of the Justice, Holiness, and Love which are the nature of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-33.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The glorification of the Son of man, and of the Father in the Son</span>. With ver. 31 the solemn valedictory discourse of our Lord commences - a veritable <span class="accented">evangelium in evangelio</span>, and by the aid of which we come more closely to the heart of Jesus. "Here," as Olshausen says, "we are entering the holy of holies in the Passion-history." We have, indeed, come through the courts of the temple, we have left the courts of the Gentiles, of the women, of the priests behind us, and have been waiting in the holy place of sacrifice and incense and ablution; now we follow our great High Priest to the veil over the holiest of all, and he prepares us to listen to the intercession that he makes before the unveiled majesty of the Father's love. The first section, extending from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31-14:31</a>, reports a series of questions by Peter, Thomas, Philip, Jude, which all turn more or less on the anticipated separation which he teaches them to regard as a veritable glorification of the Son of man, and also as a higher revelation to them of the nature of his own Person and of those relations between "the Son" and "the Father" which are imaged and shadowed forth in those between" the Son of man" and "God," which they could more readily understand. This prepares the way for the discourse and prayer which followed, in which the future spiritual union between the victorious Lord and his own disciples, between a sanctified humanity and the eternal Godhead, is exhibited, distinguished by wonderful blending of intuitive insight and supernatural revelation. The discourse is consistent with the stupendous conception which the evangelist had formed of the Person of Christ. Hilgenfeld and ethers regard this address as utterly incompatible with the valedictory discourses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24, 25</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>. We have already seen that they are but different aspects of the same mysterious and wonderful Personage; that the synoptists are not silent concerning the spiritual presence of Christ in and with his disciples till the end of the world; and, on the other hand, that the fourth evangelist is perfectly alive to the reality of his kingdom in the world and to the true nature of his second coming. (On the historical character of this discourse, see Introduction, pp. 126, 127.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - (The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> is not omitted by T.R. or Westcott and Holt.

The different punctuation of Stephens, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f7a;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, dispensed with the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>; but this arrangement is not followed by modern editors.) <span class="cmt_word">When therefore he</span> (Judas) <span class="cmt_word">was gone out</span>, and the Lord was left with his trembling but faithful eleven, his heart yearned over them without reserve or exception, and he speaks as though his Passion had begun, and even ended too. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> suggests more than "is glorified." Bengel says, "Jesus passionem ut breve iter spectatet metam potius prospicit." As Son of man, he has secured the highest glory of the most tender, humiliating self sacrifice, has cast out of the covenanted fellowship the hateful, baneful virus of a carnal triumph. To his eye as Son of man the end is secured, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-10.htm">John 17:10</a> he says, "I have been glorified in them." The thought is certainly complete without the clause appended in T.R., which simply reiterates the last clause, in order to make it the basis of a further thought: God will glorify him in (himself), if his suffering and sacrificed humanity has been the scene and material of a glory given to God, because a new manifestation of the Divine fullness in humanity; that is the reason why his very humanity will be lifted up into the Divine glory, itself becoming one with it, exalted far above these heavens, that he might fill <span class="accented">all things</span>. Elsewhere we read that "Christ is hidden in God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>). All his earthly sufferings will now be seen to be a forth-streaming of Divine love, the fullest revelation of the innermost essence of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). Godet says, "When God has been glorified by a being, he draws him to his bosom and envelops him <span class="accented">in</span> his glory." This expression scarcely sustains the sublime uniqueness of the glory of God in the Son of man, and the glory of the Son of man in God. The words, <span class="cmt_word">and will straightway glorify him</span> show how imminent was the glorification which is consummated by the new meaning put into death, and into all that leads to it and into the sacrifice involved in it. That "straightway glorify him" is a note of triumph, and this while Judas is completing his bargain (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> of this verse; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 Christ had been glorified in many miracles he wrought, yet he speaks of his being glorified now in his sufferings, as if that were more than all his other glories in his humbled state. Satisfaction was thereby made for the wrong done to God by the sin of man. We cannot now follow our Lord to his heavenly happiness, but if we truly believe in him, we shall follow him hereafter; meanwhile we must wait his time, and do his work. Before Christ left the disciples, he would give them a new commandment. They were to love each other for Christ's sake, and according to his example, seeking what might benefit others, and promoting the cause of the gospel, as one body, animated by one soul. But this commandment still appears new to many professors. Men in general notice any of Christ's words rather than these. By this it appears, that if the followers of Christ do not show love one to another, they give cause to suspect their sincerity.</body></html>
