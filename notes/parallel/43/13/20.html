They are to go forth, then, and to be content if their path is as that which their Master has trodden. They are not to be disheartened by treachery even in their midst, for this He had foreseen. The words spoken when they were called to be Apostles still hold true. Their honour and encouragement is in the fact that <span class= "ital">they</span> are Apostles from Him, as He is an Apostle from the Father. This truth is one of those solemn utterances on which He would have them dwell, and is therefore introduced by "Verily, verily." (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>.) For the words, which are exactly the same as those of the first commission, comp.

The words reveal a claim to issue such commissions, and to confer upon his apostolic and other representatives something of his <span class="accented">own</span> dignity and glory, viz. the glory of sacrifice far others, the dignity of service. He may have intended: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> To comfort those who are bewildered by the thought of the treachery within their enclosure, and to assure them that such conduct on the part of an apostle must not be allowed to lower their estimate of apostolic duty. Certain ecclesiastical interpreters find here that the unworthiness even of Judas did not destroy the Divine character of his testimony, and that the immoral character of the minister now does not annul the commission he has received. This dogma is essentially hostile to the teaching of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The royal power of the dying Christ; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the bold identification of his own claims with those of his Father. Few more wonderful sayings were uttered by Jesus, if we ponder the connection in which they stand; but let it be observed that we do <span class="accented">not</span> owe to the Fourth Gospel the <span class="accented">matter</span> of this saying. It must have been familiar to the readers of John from the solemn records of the Gospel of Matthew. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:18-30 Our Lord had often spoken of his own sufferings and death, without such trouble of spirit as he now discovered when he spake of Judas. The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles. Those whose deeds are evil, love darkness rather than light.</body></html>
