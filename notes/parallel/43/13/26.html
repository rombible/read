The pronouns are emphatic. "<span class= "ital">He</span> it is for whom <span class= "ital">I</span> . . ."The word "morsel" or "sop" occurs in the New Testament only in this context. The meaning is illustrated by the use in the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm" title="And Boaz said to her, At mealtime come you here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.">Ruth 2:14</a> ("Come thou hither, and thou shalt eat of the bread and dip thy <span class= "ital">morsel</span> in the vinegar"); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-17.htm" title="Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless has not eaten thereof;">Job 31:17</a> ("And if I ate my <span class= "ital">morsel</span> alone, and did not impart it to the orphan"). The cognate verb occurs twice in the New Testament--<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm" title="Therefore if your enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head.">Romans 12:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing.">1Corinthians 13:3</a>. (See Notes on these passages.) The original root of the word means "to rub." Hence it is "anything rubbed or broken off." It was often used for a mouthful just like "morsel," which means literally, <span class= "ital">a little bite.</span> As used here, the word means any portion of food. The general explanation that the morsel was dipped in the <span class= "ital">Charosheth</span> (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>) implies that this supper was the Paschal Supper. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus F: The Day of the Crucifixion of our Lord.</span>)<p>Our Lord would preside at the meal, and distribute to each guest his portion. When John asked the question, He was about to give the morsel to Judas. He avoids the name, and makes the act which He is about to perform convey the answer to the question. That act is the token of friendship and love which even now would redeem the heart full of treachery, if that heart would but receive it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He gave it to Judas Iscariot.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">He takes and gives</span> . . . , with the majority of good MSS. Note the solemn and sad fulness with which the name of Judas is again given by the Evangelist. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm" title="And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;">John 13:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span> (<span class="cmt_word">then</span>) <span class="cmt_word">answered</span> - "then," <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, is introduced by the modern editors, as well as <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He it is for whom I shall dip the sop</span> (or, <span class="accented">morsel</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and give it him</span>; so (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is exchanged, on very strong authority, into <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas the son of Simon, the Iscariot</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was the morsel of meat or bread dipped into the charoseth, a mead of wine and fruit used at the Paschal meal. The usage is illustrated by the LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-17.htm">Job 31:17</a>. In the New Testament <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> is used for distribution of food, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>. The act of Jesus was almost contemporaneous with the "Thou sayest it" of the synoptists It was twofold in meaning, explaining to John what he wished to know fur Peter's sake, and giving Judas one more gracious chance to repent and believe in the Divinity of love rather than that of display, power, and pomp. Judas had been dipping his hand into the same dish with his Master, eating his bread. Instead of resenting such effrontery the blessed Lord gave him in pity the last opportunity to escape, he puts the morsel sopped in the acid wine, the bread of fellowship, into his very lips, and the miscreant received it. The name of Judas, and of his father, and of the place cursed by being his birthplace, are once more introduced at length (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-71.htm">John 6:71</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:18-30 Our Lord had often spoken of his own sufferings and death, without such trouble of spirit as he now discovered when he spake of Judas. The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles. Those whose deeds are evil, love darkness rather than light.</body></html>
