They also taught that a man should love his neighbour as himself; and the fulfilment of the law is love. The contrast here is between what our Lord had said unto the Jews and what He now says to the disciples. He had said, and says again, "Whither I go ye cannot come." To the Jews he added, "Ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-34.htm" title="You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.">John 7:34-35</a>). For those who believe in Him, He has no such decree of separation, but a new and different commandment, by which His spiritual presence would be at once realised and proved. Love to one another, and therefore sacrifice of self for another's good, would be, in the truest sense, a realisation of His presence in their midst. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-8.htm" title="Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.">1John 2:8</a>.)<p>For the meaning of the word "commandment," comp.

The punctuation of our version is to be maintained. It is not, as it has sometimes been read, "That ye love one another, as I have loved you . . ." The earlier clause gives the principle of the new commandment. The latter clause repeats this, and prefaces the repetition by words referring to His own acts of love, which should be an example for them. The word "as," or "even as," does not refer to the degree of His love, but to the fact; and the special instance of love then present to the mind was the feet-washing upon which the whole of this discourse has followed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34, 35.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The demand which this glorification would make on the mutual fidelity and affection of the disciples</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A new commandment I give unto you</span> (<span class="accented">with the purpose and scope</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that ye love one another; even as</span> (or, <span class="accented">seeing that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I loved you, that ye</span> (<span class="accented">also</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>love one another</span>. The interpretation of this verse largely depends on the meaning given to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span>, if, as many translate it, "even as I loved you;" or, "after the manner and type of my love to you;" then an amply sufficient explanation arises of the <span class="accented">novelty</span> of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. So new a type of love is given that, as the Greek expositors generally have urged, there is a deeper intensity in the love than can be found in the Mosaic principle, Love thy neighbor as <span class="accented">thyself</span>." In this commandment, which embraces the whole law, self-love is assumed, and is made the standard for the love of neighbor. This <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, on the other hand, would be based on a new principle, and measured by a higher standard, and even mean more than love of self altogether. Christ's love to his disciples was self-abandoning, self-sacrificing love. This view of the passage is urged by Lucke, and really removes all necessity for the varied translations of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, such as "illustrious" (Hammond); "last" (Heumann); "one that is always new" (Olshausen); "renewed commandment," a "renewing commandment" (Augustine and Maldonatus); "the institution of the Eucharist" (Lange). But it is doubtful whether the ideal image of a perfect love constitutes the novelty, and whether the double <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> and the transposition of the second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> be found in the simple style of John. If, however, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> be taken as "seeing that," or "since I loved you" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>), Christ's love becomes not so much the manner or type, as the motive, ground, and principle of love to one another. As if he had said, "I have loved each of you unto death; in loving one another you are loving me, you are loving an object of my tender love. The desire of mere imitation, however strong, is not equal to the demand I make, while the bestowment of the 'new' principle of life arising from a response to my love <span class="accented">is</span>." For the first interpretation speaks John's own use of the idea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>). There is a third interpretation, which makes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> a sentence parallel with the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. "Even as up to this moment, and up to my death, and to the uttermost, I have loved you, I <span class="accented">give</span>," etc., "<span class="accented">in</span> order that ye may love one another, and, inspired by me, may imitate my love one towards another" (Westcott). This is an endeavor to combine both interpretations. Alford suggests that the "newness" of the commandment consists in its "<span class="accented">unicity</span>," its being the prime injunction of the new covenant, and the first-fruit of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>.). Tholuck sees the expression of self-renouncing love - the love of the highest to the sinful, the love which is more blessed to give than to receive, the all-embracing love. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 Christ had been glorified in many miracles he wrought, yet he speaks of his being glorified now in his sufferings, as if that were more than all his other glories in his humbled state. Satisfaction was thereby made for the wrong done to God by the sin of man. We cannot now follow our Lord to his heavenly happiness, but if we truly believe in him, we shall follow him hereafter; meanwhile we must wait his time, and do his work. Before Christ left the disciples, he would give them a new commandment. They were to love each other for Christ's sake, and according to his example, seeking what might benefit others, and promoting the cause of the gospel, as one body, animated by one soul. But this commandment still appears new to many professors. Men in general notice any of Christ's words rather than these. By this it appears, that if the followers of Christ do not show love one to another, they give cause to suspect their sincerity.</body></html>
