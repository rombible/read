It is a point of no importance, and cannot be determined. The natural impression from this verse, however, is that St. Peter's turn came after that of at least one other, and the impression from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-24.htm" title="Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke.">John 13:24-25</a> is that St. John himself, being nearest to his Master, was that other.<p><span class= "bld">Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</span>--For the title, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-22.htm" title="Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be to you.">Matthew 16:22</a>. The word "Thou" is to be strongly emphasised, but the common error of reading <span class= "ital">"</span>my" as an emphatic word is to be avoided. The act is in itself natural; perhaps is even one that he had expected from some of the less prominent in the apostolic band. What he cannot understand is that his Master should do it. "Lord, dost <span class= "ital">Thou</span> wash my feet?" Comp. with this feeling of the Apostle at the close of our Lord's life that of John the Baptist at its commencement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?">Matthew 3:14-15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - It cannot be determined with whom our Lord commenced the feet-washing. Some of the older expositors have said it was with Judas. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> might denote that several of the disciples, in awestruck wonder, had submitted without a word, and then (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> resumptive) <span class="cmt_word">he cometh to Simon Peter.</span> But the great bulk of ancient and modern expositors suppose that Peter was the first to whom this great grace was offered. At all events, in his impulsive manner always rushing forwards, and ready to give his Master advice, and to be the mouthpiece of otherwise unuttered feelings, Peter was the first to exclaim, (<span class="cmt_word">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">saith unto</span> <span class="accented">him</span>, and with strong emphasis on the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Dost thou wash my feet</span>? The protest was natural. It corresponds with many another scene in Peter's life; as when he said, "<span class="accented">Depart</span> from me; for I am a sinful man," or cried, "That be far from thee," and later on in this chapter, "Why cannot I follow thee now?" or, "I have never eaten anything common or unclean." This trait in Peter's character is wonderfully accurate, and corresponds with the portraiture of the same man in the synoptic narrative (see Introduction, p. 115.). There is here an analogous blending of reverence and self-will, of outwardness and forwardness - a new illustration of one who would distinguish himself by the greatness of his humility. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-17 Our Lord Jesus has a people in the world that are his own; he has purchased them, and paid dear for them, and he has set them apart for himself; they devote themselves to him as a peculiar people. Those whom Christ loves, he loves to the end. Nothing can separate a true believer from the love of Christ. We know not when our hour will come, therefore what we have to do in constant preparation for it, ought never to be undone. What way of access the devil has to men's hearts we cannot tell. But some sins are so exceedingly sinful, and there is so little temptation to them from the world and the flesh, that it is plain they are directly from Satan. Jesus washed his disciples' feet, that he might teach us to think nothing below us, wherein we may promote God's glory, and the good of our brethren. We must address ourselves to duty, and must lay aside every thing that would hinder us in what we have to do. Christ washed his disciples' feet, that he might signify to them the value of spiritual washing, and the cleansing of the soul from the pollutions of sin. Our Lord Jesus does many things of which even his own disciples do not for the present know the meaning, but they shall know afterward. We see in the end what was the kindness from events which seemed most cross. And it is not humility, but unbelief, to put away the offers of the gospel, as if too rich to be made to us, or too good news to be true. All those, and those only, who are spiritually washed by Christ, have a part in Christ. All whom Christ owns and saves, he justifies and sanctifies. Peter more than submits; he begs to be washed by Christ. How earnest he is for the purifying grace of the Lord Jesus, and the full effect of it, even upon his hands and head! Those who truly desire to be sanctified, desire to be sanctified throughout, to have the whole man, with all its parts and powers, made pure. The true believer is thus washed when he receives Christ for his salvation. See then what ought to be the daily care of those who through grace are in a justified state, and that is, to wash their feet; to cleanse themselves from daily guilt, and to watch against everything defiling. This should make us the more cautious. From yesterday's pardon, we should be strengthened against this day's temptation. And when hypocrites are discovered, it should be no surprise or cause of stumbling to us. Observe the lesson Christ here taught. Duties are mutual; we must both accept help from our brethren, and afford help to our brethren. When we see our Master serving, we cannot but see how ill it becomes us to domineer. And the same love which led Christ to ransom and reconcile his disciples when enemies, still influences him.</body></html>
