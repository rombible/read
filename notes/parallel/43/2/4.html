The former have found in each clause of the sentence a condemnation of Mariolatry; the latter have sought explanations not inconsistent with their faith and practice. It may be hoped that the day is now past, when anything other than thoughts of reverence and honour is to be connected with the title "Woman," least of all in the words of One who claimed as His own highest dignity Sonship of, identity with, humanity; and who was here addressing the mother to whom He had been subject, and from whom His own humanity had been derived. Were proof needed of the tenderness which underlies the word as used by Him, it would be found in the other instances which the Gospels supply. . It is spoken only to the Syro-Ph?nician whose faith is great (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-28.htm" title="Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith: be it to you even as you will. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.">Matthew 15:28</a>); to the daughter of Abraham loosed from her infirmity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-12.htm" title="And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her, Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity.">Luke 13:12</a>); and, in this Gospel, to the Samaritan embracing the higher faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a>); perhaps to the sinner whom He does not condemn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-10.htm" title="When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those your accusers? has no man condemned you?">John 8:10</a>); to the same mother from the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>); and to Mary Magdalene in tears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-13.htm" title="And they say to her, Woman, why weep you? She said to them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.">John 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-15.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.">John 20:15</a>).<p>Still the second part of the sentence declares beyond all doubt that the two regarded His life-work from stand-points so different that there is nothing common between them. It is literally, <span class= "ital">What is that to me and to thee?</span> The parallels for the form of the question are <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-24.htm" title="And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with the LORD God of Israel?">Joshua 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-12.htm" title="And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?">Judges 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-10.htm" title="And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD has said to him, Curse David.

And the king of Israel said to him, No: for the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.">2Kings 3:13</a>; and the thrice-recorded question of the demoniac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm" title="And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God? are you come here to torment us before the time?">Matthew 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us?

I beseech you, torment me not.">Luke 8:28</a>). The real parallel is in this Gospel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.">John 7:6</a>. Mother and brethren alike regarded life in its events; for Him it is an unchanging principle. For them, action is determined by the outer stimulus; for Him, by the eternal will of the Father. Their hour is always ready; His is the development of a law. His answer is another form of that question kept in her heart: "Wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business?" but "they understood not the saying which He spake unto them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-49.htm" title="And he said to them, How is it that you sought me? knew you not that I must be about my Father's business?">Luke 2:49</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Mine hour is not yet come</span>--i.e., the hour for My being openly manifested as the Messiah.

But the proverbial <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>; wheresoever the words occur, imply, if net personal estrangement, yet as to the matter in hand some divergence of feeling (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-28.htm">Luke 8:28</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-10.htm">2 Samuel 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>). Almost all commentators seem to suggest that our Lord refused to be guided by a mother's direction; that he wished her to understand that he was breaking off from her control and from that silent submission which he had hitherto willingly yielded (so Meyer, Hengstenberg, Godet, Westcott, Tholuck, Ebrard, and Lange). Schaff has quoted from the Fathers before the Nestorian controversy dear proof that they admitted censure, and therefore blame, in the blessed Virgin Mary. Still, it seems to me that the cause of the censure, coupled with an immediate response to her special request about the wine, has not been sufficiently appreciated, he said, "Mine hour is not yet come." It would have come if the provision of wine was the ground of divergence of sentiment; if the moment for the supply of these temporal wants were the point of difference between them. The "hour" for Christ to tell the world all that Mary knew had <span class="accented">not</span> come. The hour of the full revelation of his Messianic claims had not come, nor did it come in the temple, or by the lake, or in the feast day; not till the awful moment of rejection, when death was hovering over him, and the blow was about to fall, did he say, "The hour has come" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>) - the hour of his greatest glory. "The hour had not yet come." The hour would come when rivers of living water would be supplied to all those who come to him; when the blood he would shed would be a Divine stream, clear as crystal, for the refreshment of all nations; when at another marriage supper of a saved humanity the precious blood should be an ample supply of costly wine for all the world. Moreover, the link at the present moment between our Lord and his mother must begin to shade into something more spiritual. It was not possible that he should be holden by it. A sword would pierce through her maternal heart when she became gradually alive to the fact that they that do the will of his Father, the same were his "brothers, sisters, and mother." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 It is very desirable when there is a marriage, to have Christ own and bless it. Those that would have Christ with them at their marriage, must invite him by prayer, and he will come. While in this world we sometimes find ourselves in straits, even when we think ourselves in fulness. There was want at a marriage feast. Those who are come to care for the things of the world, must look for trouble, and count upon disappointment. In our addresses to Christ, we must humbly spread our case before him, and then refer ourselves to him to do as he pleases. In Christ's reply to his mother there was no disrespect. He used the same word when speaking to her with affection from the cross; yet it is a standing testimony against the idolatry of after-ages, in giving undue honours to his mother. His hour is come when we know not what to do. Delays of mercy are not denials of prayer. Those that expect Christ's favours, must observe his orders with ready obedience. The way of duty is the way to mercy; and Christ's methods must not be objected against. The beginning of Moses' miracles was turning water into blood, Ex 7:20; the beginning of Christ's miracles was turning water into wine; which may remind us of the difference between the law of Moses and the gospel of Christ. He showed that he improves creature-comforts to all true believers, and make them comforts indeed. And Christ's works are all for use. Has he turned thy water into wine, given thee knowledge and grace? it is to profit withal; therefore draw out now, and use it. It was the best wine. Christ's works commend themselves even to those who know not their Author. What was produced by miracles, always was the best in its kind. Though Christ hereby allows a right use of wine, he does not in the least do away his own caution, which is, that our hearts be not at any time overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, Lu 21:34. Though we need not scruple to feast with our friends on proper occasions, yet every social interview should be so conducted, that we might invite the Redeemer to join with us, if he were now on earth; and all levity, luxury, and excess offend him.</body></html>
