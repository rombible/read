It is remarkable that we have the interpretation of the spiritual temple in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a> (see Note there, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm" title="But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.">John 4:23</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-22 The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving from the temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouraged to make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much in understanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of the Scriptures.</body></html>
