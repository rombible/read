This feature of the Lord's action was not repeated at the close of the ministry. Observe that John singles out this punitive element in the first public appearance of the Lord for especial notice, and adds it to the otherwise resistless force which he was accustomed to wield by the glance of his eye or the tones of his voice. The "scourge," as Godet says, is a symbol, not an instrument. It was in Christ's hands a conspicuous method of expressing his indignation, and augmenting the force of his command, by an indication that he meant to be obeyed there and then. <span class="cmt_word">He drove them all out of the temple court</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, the intrusive sellers of the sacrificial beasts, the herdsmen, and traffickers. <span class="cmt_word">Also</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the sheep and the oxen,</span> which moved at once in a vast group, turning, fleeing to the great exits; and <span class="cmt_word">he poured out</span> on the ground, and with his own hand, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">coins</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the exchangers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), and overthrew the tables. "Christ had," as Hengstenberg says, "a powerful confederate in the consciences of the offenders." The presentiment of coming revolution and overthrow aided the impression produced by that majestic countenance and commanding glance, manner, and voice, that so often made men feel that they were utterly and absolutely in his power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a>, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-22 The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving from the temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouraged to make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much in understanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of the Scriptures.</body></html>
