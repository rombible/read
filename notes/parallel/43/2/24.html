They are easily moved just because they are not deeply moved. The eye which looked at, looked into, others (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-47.htm" title="Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!">John 1:47</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> saw to the very depth of their hearts too, and knew all. It saw in that depth that the true inner man did not believe, did not commit itself to Him; it found not the spiritual receptivity, and there could not therefore be the spiritual revelation. He, on His part, did not commit Himself unto them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a>, Note.) Our version gives the correct sense, but it should be noted that "believed" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>, and "commit" here, represent the same Greek word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jesus did not</span> (imperfect) <span class="cmt_word">trust himself to them;</span> not even to those who had "trusted on his Name." This remarkable expression corresponds with many actions and methods of Jesus. When he was offered the homage of devils, he forbade them to speak. When those who had been simply healed of bodily disease began garrulously to proclaim his praises, he silenced them. He had no faith in their faith, and consequently did not open to them more of his nature; still less did he assume, as they would have liked him to do, an immediate and outward Messiahship of political revolt. He did not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax, and often made use of the smallest remnant of spiritual apprehension; but even in Galilee, when they would by force have made him a king, "he sent the multitudes away." The apparently arbitrary permission given to others to proclaim his Name (as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to the healed demoniac of Gergesa, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>; cf. Luke 9:57-62) suggests the precise inquiry which John had felt from the first Jerusalem visit, and which, with profound insight, he thus meets: "He did not trust himself to them," <span class="cmt_word">owing to the fact that he knew</span> - (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by apperceptive and continuous processes) - <span class="cmt_word">all</span> (<span class="accented">men</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>persons</span>. He penetrated their thoughts, discerned their character, saw the meaning of their faith, the burden of their wishes, the regal passions that consumed them - he knew all. <span class="cmt_word">And also because he had no need that any should testify what was in</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man; for he himself</span> - without such aid - <span class="cmt_word">knew what was in</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man</span>. The definite articles here may either restrict the meaning to the men who happened one by one to come under his searching glance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-51.htm">John 7:51</a>; Meyer), or it may mean "man" generically, "human nature" in all its peril, weakness, and self-deception. Geikie ('Life of Christ,' 1, 508) gives a novel, though entirely indefensible, translation: "He needed not that any should bear witness respecting him as man." The better and more accurate translation is the first; but since his glance is universal and contact with souls continuous - man by man - the statement thus embraces even <span class="accented">more than is</span> involved in the generic sense. The knowledge of man (<span class="accented">homo</span>) "generically" would not embrace his individualities - would leave out the specialities of each case. The particularism of Christ's penetrative glance gives the stronger and better explanation of the reserve of Christ in dealing with these half-believers, than the generic or rather universal knowledge which is supposed to be involved. N.B. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> There is a so called faith to which Christ will <span class="accented">not</span> unveil himself - will not give himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The great reward of faith in Christ is the faith <span class="accented">of</span> Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Faith in the Name of Christ, produced now by "signs," real or artificial, fictitious or sacramental, mystic, or miraculous, or aesthetic, by <span class="accented">series Biblicae</span>, or exaggerated ideas of special providence, is not comparable to the faith in Christ himself, which the truth about him excites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is to the latter rather than to the former that the golden gates of the heart of Jesus are opened. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:23-25 Our Lord knew all men, their nature, dispositions, affections, designs, so as we do not know any man, not even ourselves. He knows his crafty enemies, and all their secret projects; his false friends, and their true characters. He knows who are truly his, knows their uprightness, and knows their weaknesses. We know what is done by men; Christ knows what is in them, he tries the heart. Beware of a dead faith, or a formal profession: carnal, empty professors are not to be trusted, and however men impose on others or themselves, they cannot impose on the heart-searching God.</body></html>
