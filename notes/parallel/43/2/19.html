The sign is in its nature an enigma, meaningless to him who does not seek to understand it, but full of meaning for him who earnestly examines into the thing signified, and in such a form as impresses itself on the memory and educates the moral powers. We have had an example of this enigmatic teaching in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-27.htm" title="He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.">John 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-30.htm" title="This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:30</a>. We shall meet with others. (Comp. John 4, 6; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.">John 16:25</a>.) The enigma turns in the present case upon the double sense of the word "temple." It meant the sacred shrine of the Deity, the Holy and Most Holy place, as distinct from the wider Temple area. But the true shrine of the Deity was the body of the Incarnate Word. The Temple of wood and stone was but the representative of the Divine Presence. That Presence was then actually in their midst. They had no reverence for the one; for, like its outer courts, it had become a house of merchandise, and was fast becoming a den of thieves. This very demand for an outward sign, while all around them feel a spiritual power, shows they have as little reverence for the other. They will destroy the real shrine; the shrine of wood and stone even will not be left to represent a Presence no longer among them. He will raise up the temple of His body the third day, and in that resurrection will be the foundation stone of the spiritual temple for the world. The use of the word "temple" by the Jews in this double sense is attested by their interpretation of the Old Testament. We have an example of the use of "tabernacle" in a parallel sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-13.htm" title="Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;">2Peter 1:13-14</a>), and the full idea of a spiritual worship and presence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21-24</a>. The sign may have been suggested by the double thought then present--the Jews destroying the sanctity of the material Temple, the disciples seeing in Him one consumed by zeal for it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16-17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-22 The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving from the temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouraged to make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much in understanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of the Scriptures.</body></html>
