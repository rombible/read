If you be the Son of God, come down from the cross.">Matthew 27:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-29.htm" title="And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you that destroy the temple, and build it in three days,">Mark 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-13.htm" title="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:">Acts 6:13</a>. It becomes in the mouth of false witnesses the accusation by means of which its meaning is accomplished. The death on the cross is the destruction of the Temple, but it is not unaccompanied by the rent veil; the two meanings are linked together.<p>It fixed itself, too, on the disciples' minds; but weeks, months, years, did not cast any light upon it until the Resurrection. These passages of those familiar Old Testament writings then came to men who had been slow of heart to see them, with the quickening power of a new life. They saw that Christ ought to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory. They saw in Moses and the Prophets the things concerning Him, and they believed in a new and higher sense the written and the spoken word. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm" title="Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?">Luke 24:26</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this</span> (to them), <span class="cmt_word">and believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus said.</span> This frequent contrast instituted by the apostle between the first impression produced on the disciples (himself among them) and that which was produced by subsequent reflection after the resurrection of Jesus and gift of the Spirit, becomes a powerful mark of authenticity (compare the passages which Godet has here cited, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-32.htm">John 4:32, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-12.htm">John 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-28.htm">John 13:28</a>; with many others). "A pseudo-John imagining, in the second century, this ignorance of the apostle in regard to a saying which he had invented himself, is 'criticism' dashing itself against moral impossibility." These quiet "asides" and reflections of the biographer on the mistaken ideas which he cites and corrects, are of consummate value, as pointing out the stages by which the most stupendous ideas that have taken human spirits captive dawned on the most susceptible minds. The "Word" and the "Scripture" helped the disciples to subsequent faith. Why is "Scripture" in the singular, seeing that John used this form of expression ten times when he had one definite passage of Scripture in his mind, and used the plural when the general authority of Scripture was appealed to? Many have looked to one or another definite Scripture text supposed to predict the resurrection of Christ, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> (some, very wrongly, to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>, where no reference can be established to this great event). Dr. Moulton points back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, and the impression which the Lord's "zeal" had produced on the disciples. It seems better to recall Christ's own words, and the comment of Luke, in Luke 24:25-27, where the whole Scripture seems to have been laid under contribution to establish the grand expectation. Further, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-9.htm">John 20:9</a>, where John, referring to the same subject, uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> in the singular, for the general tendency of Scripture. All the passages which couple suffering and apparent defeat with triumph and victory, did prepare the mind of thoughtful men for the better understanding of the Resurrection. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. and the closing words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> thereupon come into view; and, in fact, all the Scriptures which anticipate the glorious reign and victory of the Christ and the extension of his kingdom, when coupled with those which portrayed the sorrows of Messiah and of the ideal Sufferer, implicitly convey the same thought. Consequently, numerous passages in Isaiah, Micah, Daniel, Zechariah, Malachi, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a> and Psalms 72, 45, etc., taken in connection with prediction of the sorrows of Messiah, did prepare the disciples to believe that the Holy One could not be holden by the pangs of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>, etc.). Before closing this paragraph, we must notice that, in this entire transaction, the Lord is not separating himself from the existing theocracy, but interpreting its highest meaning. In the cleansing of the temple at the last he was judging and condemning. The vindication by our Lord of his own action was very different on the latter occasion from what it is here (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-17.htm">Mark 11:17</a>), and numerous other accompaniments are profoundly different; nor did he then speak of the destruction of the temple, although, as we have seen, much exaggerated and mis-apprehensive talk concerning him had been floating among the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-22 The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving from the temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouraged to make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much in understanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of the Scriptures.</body></html>
