The date of the completion is given by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 9, ? 7) as A.D. 64. The same author gives the eighteenth year of the reign of Herod the Great (Nisan 734--Nisan 735, A.U.100) as the commencement of the renewal of the Temple of Zerubbabel (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 11, ? 1). This would give A.U.C. 781-782, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> A.D. 28-29, as the date of the cleansing. In another passage Josephus gives the month Kislev A.U.C. 734, as the date of the festival connected with the building of the Temple (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xiv. 16, ? 4). This would fix our present date as the Passover of A.U.C. 781, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> A.D. 28. St. Luke furnishes us with an independent date for the commencement of the ministry of John the Baptist. If we count the "fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>) from the commencement of his first reign with Augustus (A.U.C. 765, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> A.D. 12), this date will be A.U.C. 780, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> A.D. 27. The present Passover was in the following year, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as before, A.D. 28. The sole reign of Tiberius commenced two years later (A.D. 14), so that while we have certainly no discrepancy between these independent dates, we have probably a very striking coincidence. Its bearing upon the authenticity of the present Gospel is evident.<p><span class= "bld">Rear it up</span> represents the same Greek word as "raise up," in the previous verse; but the word fits the double meaning. It is the regular term for raising from the dead; but it is also used of rearing up a building, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in 3 Ezra 5:44; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/49-11.htm" title="How shall we magnify Zorobabel? even he was as a signet on the right hand:">Ecclesiasticus 49:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - The immediate reference of the words to the building before them was only one of a thousand misapplications of the words of Jesus. The seeds of truth which his words contain would take root in after days. Meanwhile <span class="cmt_word">the Jews answered and said</span> - taking the obvious and literal sense of the words, and treating them with an ill-concealed irony, if not scoff, to which our Lord made no reply - <span class="cmt_word">In forty and six years was this temple built</span> as we see it today. This is one of the most important chronological data for the life of our Lord. Herod the Great, according to Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:11 1), commenced the rebuilding of the second temple in the autumn of the eighteenth year of his reign. We find that his first year reckoned from Nisan, A.U.C. 717-718. Consequently, the eighteenth year must have commenced between Nisan, A.U.C. 734-735 and 735-736. The forty-sixth year after this would make the. Passover at which this speech was delivered - the spring of A.U.C. 781 (Wieseler, 'Chronicles Synopsis of the Four Gospels,' translation; and Herzog, 'Encyc.,' 21:546. The fact that Josephus, in his 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:21, gives the fifteenth year of Herod's reign instead of the eighteenth, is shown by Wieseler to be an error of the transcriber, see p. 152, note), which, if we compare with the other hints, is a fixed point from which to reckon the birth year and death year of our Lord. The "about thirty years old" of the Lord at his baptism throws us to about A.U.C. 751, <span class="date">B.C. 2</span>, for the year of his birth, and <span class="accented">if</span> there be only one Passover mentioned in John's Gospel between this and the last Passover, it gives A.U.C. 783 for the year of his death. This date is at least coincident with the date derived from the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, as that of the commencement of the mission of John (see my examination of these dates in appendix to 'John the Baptist'). The temple which Herod began to repair in the eighteenth year of his reign was not completed until A.D. , under Herod Agrippa II., a very short period before its utter destruction. The irony and scorn are manifest: <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou raise it up in three days?</span> John shows, in ver. 21, that, in the deep sense in which our Lord used the words, he abundantly justified his promise. <span class="cmt_word">But he</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the Lord, not the people, not the disciples - <span class="cmt_word">spake of the temple of his body.</span> This is the reflection which was made upon the word of Jesus by the evangelists in after days. Even Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-58.htm">Mark 14:58</a>) reveals the presence of a spiritual interpretation of the words by some of his unsympathetic listeners. It must not be forgotten that, in the synoptists, we find the presence of the idea that his service was a temple service, and that he was greater than the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-6.htm">Matthew 12:6</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22, 23</a>; with Ephesians 2:19-22). Nor must it be forgotten that the Logos itself was, in the figurative language of Philo, spoken of as the house, or temple, of God. Later rabbinical representations also describe "the body of man as the temple in which the Shechinah operates" (Wunsche). A difficulty arises from the Lord's having claimed in these words to be on the point of raising himself from the dead, whereas elsewhere his resurrection is referred to the mighty power of God, as in ver. 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-10.htm">Acts 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, etc. Without doubt, God and the Father, the Supreme Power, was thus seen in living activity; but the Divine nature of Christ not infrequently so steps forward into his <span class="accented">consciousness</span> that he can say, "I and the Father are one;" and (ch. 10:17, 18) "I will lay down my life that I may take it again" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8-10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-22 The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving from the temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouraged to make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much in understanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of the Scriptures.</body></html>
