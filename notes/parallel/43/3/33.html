Earlier disciples, as Andrew and John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>), had passed from the Forerunner to the Great Teacher, and had heard in His words that which went to the divine in their own spirits, and had come from the short first meeting with the conviction, "We have found the Messias." They received the witness, and, as they heard it, they too became witnesses. Just as a man sets his private seal--here, probably, the common Eastern stamp that affixed the name is thought of--and by it attests the truth of a document, so they attested, in the power which that witness had over their lives, their recognition of it as truth. It has always been so. The moral fitness of Christianity to meet the spiritual needs of men, and its moral power over the lives of men in all the varying circumstances of culture, race, and creed, has raised up in every age an holy army of witnesses, who have set their seal to its divine truth. (Comp. for the thought of sealing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm" title="When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.">Romans 15:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="If I be not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.">1Corinthians 9:2</a>; &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-36.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">The consequences of accepting and rejecting the supreme revelation.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that receiveth his witness</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his testimony to what he hath personally seen and heard in the heaven from which he has come - <span class="cmt_word">sealed</span> - (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), confirmed by such very act, ratified arid vindicated as trustworthy and stable (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>. l 1; 15:28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm">1 Corinthians 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>. In other places the idea or image of a "seal" is used for guaranteeing a special commission, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a> (see notes); <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">that God is true;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> admits that the words of Christ are the words of God, are absolute truth and reality - an idea which is made more obvious by ver. 35, where Jesus is the Ambassador of God. It may even mean more than this, viz. that in Jesus "all the promises of God are Yea and Amen," that God is true in himself, and the witness of Christ embraces all that for which prophecy and promise and previous revelation had prepared the way (see Luthardt and Westcott). Such an idea is certainly beyond the scope of John's ministry or message. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.</body></html>
