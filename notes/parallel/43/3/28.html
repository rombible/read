This announcement, made with great publicity at Bethany, was the basis of the present remonstrance; and the words which follow strongly sustain John's reference to the Divine predestination in his own case and that of Jesus (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> may point back to the discourse of John, or may simply indicate transition to the second statement). <span class="cmt_word">But that I</span> <span class="cmt_word">am one sent</span> (on a special mission) <span class="cmt_word">before him</span>. He boldly implies, "This is more than I have already testified concerning 'the Christ;' and my place is not at his side, not following in his train. I am 'a voice;' my work is continuously to break up a way for him. I am here still, making the mountains low, and filling up the valleys for the approach of the great King." A man can receive nothing in the shape of lifework except that which is assigned to him out of heaven. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.</body></html>
