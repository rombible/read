It has been usual to follow Jerome and Eusebius, who fix the place in the valley of the Jordan, eight miles south from Bethshan, or Scythopolis. (See quotation from the <span class= "ital">Onomasticon,</span> in Caspari, <span class= "ital">Chron. and Geogr. Introd.,</span> Eng. Trans., p. 122.) The objection to this is, that the text seems to limit us to Judaea (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-3.htm" title="He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.">John 4:3-4</a>), whereas this Salim is more than thirty miles from it. The word 'non means "springs," and probably belonged to more than one place where "there was much water." The mention of this is opposed to the locality of the Jordan valley, where it would not be necessary to choose a place for this reason. Dr. Barclay (<span class= "ital">City of the Great Xing,</span> 1858, pp. 558-570) found both names in a place answering the description, and certainly answering the narrative better than other identifications, at <span class= "ital">Wady Farah,</span> about five miles from Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">They came</span>--i.e., the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And John also was baptizing in AEnon, near to Salim, because there were many waters there; and they came, and were baptized.</span> There is much difficulty in determining the site of AEnon, near Saleim. Eusebius and Jerome (in 'Onomasticon') place it in the northern part of Samaria, about eight miles south of Scythopolis (Jerome, 'Ad Evagrium,' Ep. 126; Epiph., 'Haer.,' 55:2; Winer, 'Real Wort.,' 1:33; Lucke, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>; Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 2:176). This does not well accord with the statement that Jesus was "in Judaea," and proposed to "pass through Samaria" (cf. ver. 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1-4</a>). It may be observed, however, that our narrative does not limit the scene of our Lord's Judaean ministry to any one place, nor does it assert that the Baptist and Jesus were in near proximity, but rather the reverse. There is a <span class="accented">Shilhim</span> mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a>, with which is associated an <span class="accented">ain</span> (or fountain) - a word closely resembling "<span class="accented">AEnon."</span> This would seem to have been in the south of Judaea. Godet thinks that, since <span class="accented">Ain</span> and <span class="accented">Rimmon are</span> associated with each other in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>, and an <span class="accented">En-Remmon</span> is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>, that we have in this blending the origin of the word "<span class="accented">AEnon</span>." He thinks that the presence of waters is more likely to be specified in a dry region like that of the border of Edom than in a fertile district like Samaria; and he goes on to argue that Jesus may therefore have travelled south between Hebron and Beersheba, even as, in the synoptics, we find him in Caesarea Philippi, the northernmost portion of the Holy Land. Certainly he may have tarried there during the eight months, but we have no right to establish it from this passage. It is not said that Jesus was at AEnon. Dr. Barclay (1858) reports the discovery of AEnon at <span class="accented">Wady Far'ah</span>, a secluded valley five miles northeast of Jerusalem (Grove, Smith's ' Dict. Bible'). The recent discoveries of the Palestine Exploration Society find this Enun (<span class="accented">Aynun</span>) and Saleim not far from the <span class="accented">Askar</span>, or Sychar, where Jesus rested when John's ministry had been suddenly arrested. (Edersheim thinks that this Enon and Salim in <span class="accented">Wady Far'ah</span> leading from Samaria to the Jordan, are too far apart; but see 'Pal. Exp. Fund Report,' 1874, p. 141; 'Pict. Palestine,' 2:237; 'Tent-Work in Palestine,' 1:91-93.) Allegory reaches the point of absurdity when we are told by Theme that neither place nor time are historic. The <span class="accented">Salem</span> is (says he), according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>, the tabernacle or place of God, and therefore, according to Philo, indicates the Logos, who thenceforth becomes the Illuminator and Ruler. "The multitude of waters" would be suitable, necessary, to any great gatherings such as those which had followed the Baptist to the banks of the Jordan, as well as for baptismal processes. Such a site for AEnon is far more probable, on historical grounds, than is the southern extremity of Judaea; for Herod would have had no jurisdiction there, and would not have been tempted to arrest John's ministrations, nor would he or Herodias have suffered from the Baptist's rebuke of their adultery, if such reproaches had been spoken so far away from the centre of his tetrarchy. If, however, John had made no secret of his disapproval in regions so near to Galilee and Peraea, over which he presided, the consequent irritation of the voluptuous prince may have been more easily aroused, and his vengeance more legitimately taken. But how came John to be still administering baptism with a group of disciples of his own, and doing this long after the amazing announcements he had made in the spring of the year with reference to the rank and functions of the Lord Jesus? This narrative is the true key to the otherwise inexplicable contrariety between the Johannine testimonies to Christ and the message from the prison as described by the synoptists. It is the solution of the mystery that one who hailed Jesus as the Son of God and the Lamb of God and Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, and who was declared by Christ himself to be the greatest of woman born, was, notwithstanding, "less than the least in the kingdom of heaven." John is here shown by <span class="accented">the fourth evangelist</span> to have been still taking an independent position. He pointed others to Jesus, but he did not enroll himself among his followers. John was at last "offended" more than he knew at the humility of Jesus. He still waited for the coming of the Conqueror and the Wielder of the axe; he was looking for the manifested King, for the hour which had not yet come. He is a remarkable specimen of the energy with which a great purpose is embraced by those who are pledged to make it accomplish its end. The preparatory work of John could not, any more than the Hebraism of which it was the highest type, come to an abrupt end voluntarily; hence he continued it even to the peril of sacrificing all its value. <span class="accented">They came, and were baptized</span>; as "they" had done at Bethabara. There was some splitting up of the Messianic movement (Keim), and we see the effect of it upon his disciples and him self. Even in the midst of the labours of Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1-4</a>), we find that Johannine baptism was still practised, and traces of the custom may still be observed in Oriental sects even to the present day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.</body></html>
