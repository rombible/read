What the exact nature of it was we do not know, and have no means of judging. It was one of the questions which in every age has arisen about external rites, and has too often been accompanied by a neglect of inner principles. This arose in some way from the fact of the disciples of Jesus baptising near to the place where John was baptising, and doubtless was closely connected with these baptisms. The fact is only preserved as an incidental introduction to the remarkable testimony of the Baptist which follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There arose therefore a</span> <span class="cmt_word">questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew</span> <span class="cmt_word">about purifying.</span> Such proximity of two such leaders, teaching and proclaiming the kingdom of heaven, and baptizing into a glorious hope, a Divine future, and a spiritual change, was certain to excite controversy. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) "questioning" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a> for the dispute at Antioch, and Paul uses the same phrase for dangerous, useless, and angry debate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-23.htm">2 Timothy 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-9.htm">Titus 3:9</a>). It was, perhaps, not the first, and certainly it was not the last, of the controversies which raged over the symbolic purification of the Church. John's disciples appear to have taken up arms against some particular <span class="accented">Jew</span>, who was prepared either to question the right of Jesus to baptize, or the essential value of this ordinance. This "Jew" was apparently maintaining a greater potency for the baptism of Jesus than John could claim for his, and was basing his view upon the testimony which John had already borne to Jesus. <span class="accented">Purifying</span> was the great theme of Essenic and Pharisaic profession. It was without doubt one of the great symbolic purposes of the Levitical legislation. The purification of the flesh was, however, in Christ's teaching, a very small part of the claim for purity. Nothing less than a spiritual and radical moral change availed, and our Lord insisted on this to the disparagement of the mere ceremonial. This was the first recorded discussion on the nature and value of baptismal purifying. Would that it had been the last! The question arose among those who had been baptized by John, whether another had any right to administer such an ordinance? Could another receive the confession of sins? Was the baptism of John to terminate now that he had come of whom John himself had said, "This is he that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.</body></html>
