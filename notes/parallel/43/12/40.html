Our Lord, as we have seen, quotes them as explaining His own teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm" title="And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:">Matthew 13:14</a>); St. John quotes them here to explain the rejection of that teaching; St. Paul quotes them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-26.htm" title="Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:">Acts 28:26</a>, to explain the rejection of the Gospel by the Jews at Rome. Yet we are to remember that the prophet and those who quote him are all witnesses that within Israel there were eyes which were not blinded and hearts which were not hardened. Isaiah, and John, and Paul, were all Jews; and our Lord Himself was, in His human nature, of the seed of Abraham. Isaiah's prophecy is accompanied by the promise of a holy seed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm" title="Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.">John 12:13</a>); St. John quotes these words, and adds that "even of the rulers many believed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>); St. Paul quotes them when "some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24</a>); our Lord quotes them, and immediately says, "But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear." There is, indeed, a judicial blinding and a judicial hardening--let no man therefore presume; but these come only to eyes that will not to see, and to hearts that will not to hear--let no man therefore despair. The quotation in this place does not follow exactly either the Hebrew or the Greek of the passage in Isaiah. In the Hebrew text, as in the Authorised version, the prophet is commanded to "make the heart of this people fat." . . . The Greek text says simply, "The heart of this people was hardened." . . . St. John represents the action which God commanded to be done as done by Himself, and speaks of it in the past tense.<p><span class= "bld">And I should heal them.</span>--The pronoun here refers to Christ. St. John in his interpretation of the prophecy has made God ("He") the author of the judicial blindness and hardness, and represents Christ as the physician. This clause is, however, not to be taken separately, but is governed by "that not" which precedes, The effect of their not turning was that Christ could not heal them.<p>On the whole verse comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm" title="And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:">Matthew 13:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-26.htm" title="Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:">Acts 28:26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - There are several illustrations in this verse that the <span class="accented">diction</span> of the evangelist differs from that which he uses when recording the words of Christ. Thus <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is peculiar to John himself, and thus is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> occurs five times in the style of John himself (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-27.htm">John 4:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-13.htm">John 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-4.htm">John 21:4</a>), not once by our Lord. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> again is used four times by the evangelist, and seven times in the Epistles and Apocalypse, but never put by him into the lips of Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless many of the rulers believed on him</span>. These words are used, not to mitigate the charge, but to show that, though individuals did believe, even among the rulers, they had not courage to avow their faith. The instances of Nicodemus and Joseph and others lie upon the surface. Godet thinks rather of Gamaliel and the like, "the Eras-muses of those days." Theirs was, indeed, an hypocrisy of unbelief, and it is not 'altogether banished from the modern world, and notwithstanding Christ's rejection by the nation as a nation, individuals saw his glory and believed. It is still true of municipalities, nations, even Churches, that they reject Christ, while individuals among them are molded by and obedient to the faith. <span class="cmt_word">But by reason of the Pharisees</span> - our Lord's most deadly enemies, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12.htm">John 12</a>. - <span class="cmt_word">they were making no confession</span> - or, <span class="accented">acknowledgment -</span> of his claims, <span class="cmt_word">lest they should be put out of the synagogue</span>; become the excommunicate, fall under the terrible ban (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>). The fear of class exclusion, the dread of running counter to the current opinion of the Church or the world, has led to much of the misery of both. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:37-43 Observe the method of conversion implied here. Sinners are brought to see the reality of Divine things, and to have some knowledge of them. To be converted, and truly turned from sin to Christ, as their Happiness and Portion. God will heal them, will justify and sanctify them; will pardon their sins, which are as bleeding wounds, and mortify their corruptions, which are as lurking diseases. See the power of the world in smothering convictions, from regard to the applause or censure of men. Love of the praise of men, as a by-end in that which is good, will make a man a hypocrite when religion is in fashion, and credit is to be got by it; and love of the praise of men, as a base principle in that which is evil, will make a man an apostate, when religion is in disgrace, and credit is to be lost for it.</body></html>
