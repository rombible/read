They were branches of the palms growing on the spot, or possibly such as were in general use at festivities. For the word rendered "branches," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/13-51.htm" title="And entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month in the hundred seventy and first year, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, and with viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed a great enemy out of Israel.">1 Maccabees 13:51</a> ("branches of palm trees"), and for that rendered "palm trees," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a>. Neither word occurs elsewhere in the New Testament. Again, the fuller Synoptic narrative includes but does not state this particular.<p><span class= "bld">Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span>--The better reading is, <span class= "ital">Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, and the King of Israel.</span> These words of their cry are peculiar to St. John. The fullest report is St. Matthew's (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-9.htm" title="Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.">John 12:9</a>). That all the accounts differ is natural, and they have all preserved to us some distinctive acclamation with which the crowds welcomed Him whom they received as the Messiah. The 118th Psalm, from which these acclamations are taken (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-25.htm" title="He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.">John 12:25-26</a>), was currently interpreted as Messianic, and formed part of the Hallel chanted at Tabernacles and Passover. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>.)<p>It is important to observe that St. John, like St. Matthew, does not follow the Greek of the LXX. in translating the Hebrew word "Hosanna," but preserves the Hebrew sound in Greek letters. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-6.htm" title="And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns.">Revelation 19:6</a>, where the word "Alleluia" is transliterated in the same way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-19 Christ's riding in triumph to Jerusalem is recorded by all the evangelists. Many excellent things, both in the word and providence of God, disciples do not understand at their first acquaintance with the things of God. The right understanding of spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, prevents our misapplying the Scriptures which speak of it.</body></html>
