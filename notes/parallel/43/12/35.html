The word connects what follows closely with what has gone before. It was because of their question that Jesus said this. And yet it is not said that "He answered them," because what He said was not a direct answer. They are asking questions in which we may trace the spirit, if not the very words, of the formal, literal objectors who had, with like technicalities, stifled the truth whenever it was springing up in their minds. Such questions cannot be really answered, because they are not really questions. And now the day has gone, and the night is at hand. The old thought comes back to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.">John 11:9</a>). The last rays of light are shining. It is but a little while, and He warns them with all the solemnity of this thought.<p><span class= "bld">Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you.</span>--The better reading is, <span class= "ital">Walk according as ye have the light</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "Walk as men who are conscious that the light is among them, use your opportunities; do not ask questions to raise objections, but ask them in order that you may know the truth." The man who thus used the light would by no means walk in darkness, but would have the light of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>). For him that neglected to use the means and faculty he had, both would cease to exist. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>.)<p>The words "come upon," or "overtake," is used of some sudden seizure. There are two parallels in Biblical Greek, "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness that the day should <span class= "ital">overtake</span> you as a thief" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" title="But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.">1Thessalonians 5:4</a>), and "Be sure your sin will <span class= "ital">find you out"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-23.htm" title="But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He that walketh in darkness.</span>--Comp. Notes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.">John 11:9</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1John 2:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Knoweth not whither he goeth.</span>--The last word means "goeth away," "departeth." The frequent use of the word by St. John to express departure to the other world suggests that meaning here. He was going away. They ask, "Who is this Son of man who is lifted up," "who goes away?" He warns them lest darkness seize them, and they go away into darkness. In the next four chapters the same word is used twelve times of Christ's departure. (Comp. <span class= "ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-3.htm" title="Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;">John 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm" title="Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.">John 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-36.htm" title="Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where go you? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.">John 13:36</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - Christ's reply is introduced with a simple <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said to them</span>, not in answer to their question, but by taking up a title of dignity that he had claimed before, he evidently assumes to be the Light of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), and now the time is almost over when they could see its luster or discern other things, either themselves, or their sins, or this world, or the next world, by that Light. The time for further instruction, or remonstrance, or declarations is at an end. The evangelist sums up, in vers. 44-50, the general substance of our Lord's teaching with reference to himself and his disciples and the world which would not believe; and thus, then, in a wonderful way, justifies, as it were, the non-answer to the captious question, "Who is this Son of man?" <span class="cmt_word">Yet a little while is the Light amongst you.</span> The "little while" of our Lord's day of ministry was often upon his lips (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16</a>). Verily to his consciousness it must have been but as the twinkling of an eye, and now it was a very little while even for his hearers. Based on this solemn fact, he makes a last public appeal to individuals, propounding gracious invitation, Divine promise, solemn warning; and so he terminated his public ministry, and vanished from before them. As far as the memory of his living words and deeds might influence them, the Light, though not among them, might still shine, and the glory of Pentecost would renew the appeal. <span class="cmt_word">Walk as ye have the Light</span>; make progress in the understanding of self, of duty, of time, of eternity, and act accordingly. The <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> is the reading preferred to the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of the T.R. in this and the following verse by Tischendorf, Meyer, Westport and Hort, and the Revisers' text. Meyer here differs from Godet and others who, accepting the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>, give it, in virtue of certain passages in the classics, the sense of <span class="accented">quamdiu</span>, and justly maintains the sense "as," "in the measure that." According to the light that you see, <span class="cmt_word">walk, lest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, "in order that not") <span class="cmt_word">darkness overtake you: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth;</span> lest the possibility of seeing the Divine revelation in <span class="accented">me</span> be taken from you, and lest there be taken away from you that which you seem to have (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>). Then, in harmony with the great sayings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4, 5</a> and John 11:9, "In the night no man can work;" "In the night, when men cannot see the light of this world, they stumble over unseen perils and pitfalls;" so here, he says, in the darkness that will come upon men from making no use of the Light of the world, "they will not know whither they are going," they will find no work, have no perception of imminent danger, but, driven on and on by measureless force, they will drift over the fathomless unknown into infinite and endless suspense. When the Light of the world is spurned, and a godless evolution made to supply its place, humanity and the world have no goal set before them; there is no end at which they aim - no mind or will to guide the progress of mankind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:34-36 The people drew false notions from the Scriptures, because they overlooked the prophecies that spoke of Christ's sufferings and death. Our Lord warned them that the light would not long continue with them, and exhorted them to walk in it, before the darkness overtook them. Those who would walk in the light must believe in it, and follow Christ's directions. But those who have not faith, cannot behold what is set forth in Jesus, lifted up on the cross, and must be strangers to its influence as made known by the Holy Spirit; they find a thousand objections to excuse their unbelief.</body></html>
