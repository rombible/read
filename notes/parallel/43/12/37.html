They refer to the multitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>). St. John's narrative implies, therefore, that the "signs" of the earlier Gospels were well known. He has himself recorded but six miracles, and all these, with the exception of the feeding the five thousand, belong to the Judaean ministry. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Yet</span> <span class= "bld">they believed not on him.</span>--This is the writer's comment on the general result of Christ's work at the close of His public teaching. This too is said of the multitude, the people as a whole. There were, of course, not a few who were then walking according as they had light, but it was not so with the many. Rejection and not acceptance was the result of Christ's personal work on earth; yet rejection accompanied, as on this day, by signs which pointed to a world-wide acceptance. "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37-43.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The <span class="accented">reflections of the evangelist</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though he had done so many signs in their presence, yet they believed not on him,</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> is discriminated from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, Plat., 'Gorgias,' p. 456, c.

If "<span class="accented">so</span> many" <span class="accented">be</span> the correct reading, John is simply implying what he elsewhere expresses, that a widespread knowledge was possessed by him of groups of miraculous signs, of which he recorded only seven crucial symbolic specimens; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> wine; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> bread; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> walking on the sea; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> healing nobleman's son; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> healing impotent man; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> resurrection of Lazarus; to he followed by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> the healing of the ear of Malchns, and the resurrection of the Lord himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Signs in heaven, earth and sea;<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> startling miracles on human nature, and<br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> on dead men, did not compel belief. The inaccessibility of the people reveals their mental condition, but no reproach is thrown upon the method which the Lord took to reveal his Divine mission. The tragic refrain still echoes on, "<span class="accented">He</span> came unto his own, and his own received him not? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:37-43 Observe the method of conversion implied here. Sinners are brought to see the reality of Divine things, and to have some knowledge of them. To be converted, and truly turned from sin to Christ, as their Happiness and Portion. God will heal them, will justify and sanctify them; will pardon their sins, which are as bleeding wounds, and mortify their corruptions, which are as lurking diseases. See the power of the world in smothering convictions, from regard to the applause or censure of men. Love of the praise of men, as a by-end in that which is good, will make a man a hypocrite when religion is in fashion, and credit is to be got by it; and love of the praise of men, as a base principle in that which is evil, will make a man an apostate, when religion is in disgrace, and credit is to be lost for it.</body></html>
