Note on the reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-17.htm" title="The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record.">John 12:17</a>.) The result of seeing His glory was that he spake of Him. This is St. John's interpretation of the prophecy. Isaiah himself tells us, "I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.">John 6:1</a>). But no man hath seen God at any time. The Word is the express image of His Person. This glory was of the pre-incarnate Word, who was in the beginning with God, and was God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things said Isaiah, because</span> <span class="cmt_word">he saw his glory, and he spake of him.</span> By this reference to the theophany of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1, 2</a> the evangelist here identifies Christ with the <span class="accented">Adonai</span> whom the prophet saw in his vision, and thus expresses his conception of the Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>). Because the prophet saw the glory of Christ, the unutterable majesty of the "Word of God," he delivered, as we know, this tremendous burden. Few utterances of the New Testament convey in more startling form the conviction of the apostles touching the pre-existence of the Lord, and the identification of the Divine Personality of the Christ, with the highest conception that the Hebrew prophet entertained of the Almighty One, of the eternal Godhead. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:37-43 Observe the method of conversion implied here. Sinners are brought to see the reality of Divine things, and to have some knowledge of them. To be converted, and truly turned from sin to Christ, as their Happiness and Portion. God will heal them, will justify and sanctify them; will pardon their sins, which are as bleeding wounds, and mortify their corruptions, which are as lurking diseases. See the power of the world in smothering convictions, from regard to the applause or censure of men. Love of the praise of men, as a by-end in that which is good, will make a man a hypocrite when religion is in fashion, and credit is to be got by it; and love of the praise of men, as a base principle in that which is evil, will make a man an apostate, when religion is in disgrace, and credit is to be lost for it.</body></html>
