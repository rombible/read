He claims for all the authority and commission of the Father. Every truth uttered by Him, and every work and word by which it was uttered, was ordained by the Father's will. He was Himself the Word of God. Every tone and accent in which that Word spoke was divine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 49, 50.</span> - There is much emphasis to be laid upon the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which implies that our Lord would give a sacred reason for the tremendous power with which his <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> would be invested. The <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, is not simply his; it did not proceed from himself only, from his humanity, or even his Divine Sonship alone, but from <span class="cmt_word">the Father which sent me</span>. He stood and spake always as the Voice of the Eternal One, from whom he came, with saving powers. <span class="cmt_word">He has given me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak</span>. The two words <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> (<span class="accented">dicam</span> and <span class="accented">loquar</span>, Vulgate), though Hengstenberg says it is frivolous to distinguish, are supposed by Meyer, Westcott, and Godet, to discriminate matter and form, as Godet says, "What I should say, and how I should say <span class="accented">it</span>." My words and their manner and opportunity and tone are all of them the outcome of the Father's <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span>. It certainly is incredible that John could have put these words into the lips of Jesus. They are no mere summary. They are set down with awful sincerity as having burned themselves into his memory. But the Lord added, "I may be rejected and my words spurned, and yet they may go on as apparitors of judgment, but however that may be, and <span class="cmt_word">I know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that his commandment,</span> his commission to me<span class="cmt_word">, is life eternal</span> - is so now" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12, 13</a>). "The Law is ordained unto life," said Paul, and "the goodness of God leadeth us unto repentance." The depth of this sublime experience goes down and back into the eternal counsels. <span class="cmt_word">The things which therefore I speak</span> (am speaking even at this moment), <span class="cmt_word">even as the Father has said unto me, so I speak</span>. "In rejecting me and my words, men reject and insult the Father. His word they dare to renounce, as solemn and unalterable as the word spoken on Sinai. They not only reject me, but they count themselves unworthy of eternal life. They not only spurn Law, but love." Thus, at the conclusion of the public ministry, the evangelist sets forth, in a few burning words, the theme of the prologue, so far as it is realized in the offer of a full revelation of the Logos to the world in human flesh. This Logos found adequate utterance through the human life and lips of Jesus. "The Father has been so amply revealed that the non-believer and rejecter, who hears and does not keep my sayings, is disbelieving and rejecting Hill." These potent words, and this wonderful conclusion of the entire record of the public ministry of Jesus, is the appropriate summary of teachings which were now brought to a dose. Without any exact parallels, they breathe the spirit of the whole teaching, they supply the basis of the prologue. It is, however, dear that the style is different from the prologue, and from the reflection of the evangelist in previous verses. Just as the whole Gospel is a series of recollections which form from their own intrinsic glory and truth a sacred inimitable whole, so this <span class="accented">spicilegium</span> is a brief <span class="accented">evangelium in evangelio - a</span> gathering up of the whole in the narrow compass of a few precious lines. Though "the hour" has come, it waits. The comparison between this method of the evangelist and that of the apocalyptist is very impressive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:44-50 Our Lord publicly proclaimed, that every one who believed on him, as his true disciple, did not believe on him only, but on the Father who sent him. Beholding in Jesus the glory of the Father, we learn to obey, love, and trust in him. By daily looking to Him, who came a Light into the world, we are more and more freed from the darkness of ignorance, error, sin, and misery; we learn that the command of God our Saviour is everlasting life. But the same word will seal the condemnation of all who despise it, or neglect it.</body></html>
