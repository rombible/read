(Comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-25.htm" title="For whoever will save his life shall lose it: and whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.">Matthew 16:25-26</a>.) It is the seat of the natural feelings and emotions, and, as the fatal hour approaches, our Lord is in that region of His human life troubled. There is a real shrinking from the darkness of the death which is at hand. The conflict exists but for a moment, but in all its fearfulness is real, and then the cup of the world's woe is seized and drunk to its bitter dregs. Men have sometimes wondered that St. John passes over the agony of the garden of Gethsemane, but the agony of Gethsemane is here, and the very words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a> are echoed. Men have wondered, too, that in the life of the Son of man a struggle such as this could have had even a moment's place. Not a few, indeed, would at any cost read the words otherwise. But they <span class= "ital">cannot</span> be read otherwise, either on the written page or in the hearts of men. That troubled soul asked, "What shall I say?" Blessed reality! In that struggle humanity struggled, and in that victory humanity won.<p><span class= "bld">Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span>--It is uncertain whether the first words of this sentence are a prayer, or whether they should be read as a question. In the latter case the meaning would be, "What shall I say? Shall I say, Father save Me from this hour? But no: for this cause came I unto this hour. I cannot shrink back or seek to be delivered from it." As a prayer the meaning would be--"Father, save Me from this hour; but for this cause, that I may be saved from it, came I unto this hour. The moment of agony is the moment of victory."<p>The real difficulty of the verse lies in the words <span class= "ital">"</span>for this cause," for which a meaning must be sought in the context. No interpretation of them is free from objection, but that which seems to have, upon the whole most probability, understands them as referring to the words which follow, and reads the clause, "Father, glorify Thy name," as part of this verse. The sense of the whole passage would therefore be, "Father, save Me from this hour; but Thy will, not Mine, be done; for this cause came I unto this hour, that Thy name be glorified; Father, glorify Thy name." (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-49.htm" title="I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?">Luke 12:49-50</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-30.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The <span class="accented">anticipation of Gethsemane</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>, at this moment, has been and yet <span class="cmt_word">is my soul troubled</span> ("concurrebat horror morris et ardor obedientisa," Bengel). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a> we hear that he troubled himself, and shuddered wrathfully in his "spirit" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) at the contemplation of all the evils and curse of death; now his whole <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his life centered in its corporeal environment as a man, the self which the Son of God had taken up into the Divine essence, was in depth of agony, preluding the strong crying and tears to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a> refers. These perturbations of his soul and spirit can only be accounted for by the uniqueness of his Personality, the capacity for suffering, and the extent to which he was identifying himself with the sinful nature with which he had invested himself. Sin is the sting of death. He had by the nature of his incarnation become sin for us. Martyrs, freed from sin, delivered from its curse and shame and power through him, face it with calmness and hope; but there was infinite space in his breast for all the curse of it to rain its horrible tempest. He felt that the hour of his extremest travail had come upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And what shall I</span> (must I) <span class="cmt_word">say</span>? What is the regal passion of my heart? What is the right revelation for me to make to you? What is the prayer for me to offer to the Father? It remains a great question whether the next utterance is the primary answer of the question itself, or whether it continues the interrogation - whether, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Lord lifts up for a moment the cry of heart-rending grief, <span class="accented">Father, save me from this hour!</span> or whether he said, <span class="accented">Shall I say, Father, save me from this hour?</span> The first view supposes in the first place actual uncertainty and awful bewilderment, and then a most intense cry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) to him who was able to save him from death. Save me either from the death itself, or from the fear and horror which accompanies it (Lucke, Meyer, Hengstenberg, and Moulton). <span class="accented">It</span> need not be a prayer to leave the world unsaved, to sacrifice all the work on which he had come. We are told by the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) that he was "heard" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) and delivered from human weakness which might have rebelled in the intolerable darkness of that hour. <span class="cmt_word">Father, save me from this hour</span>; the equivalent to the prayer, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me," with its grand "nevertheless," etc. If this be its meaning, we have a scene nearly, if not closely, identifiable with the agony of the garden. The correction which immediately follows augments the comparison with the scene in Gethsemane recorded by the synoptists. The R.T. and Revised Version have put their note of interrogation after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> into the margin, and not into the text. Ewald, Lange, Kling, Tholuck, Lachmann, accept this punctuation, and Godet regards it as an hypothetical prayer, although he does not place the interrogation after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The self-interrogation of the previous utterance at least reveals the presence of such a desire, but one which vanishes as the mysterious hour engulfs and wraps him round. If this be the true interpretation, then the clause that follows must be, <span class="cmt_word">Nay</span> this <span class="cmt_word">I</span> cannot say, for on account of this very conflict - <span class="cmt_word">for this cause</span> - only to fight this great battle - <span class="cmt_word">I came</span> steadily forward <span class="cmt_word">to this hour</span>. I cannot pray to escape from it. If, however, we have the expression of an actual though momentary prayer, and if we give it the meaning, "bring me safely through and out of this hour," it corresponds with the Divine trust in the Father's love which, in the extremity of the anguish and desertion, he yet reveals, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> becomes equivalent to "Pray, this I need not say; the end is known" (Westcott). I know that I shall be delivered, <span class="accented">for this cause, viz</span>. <span class="accented">that</span> I should encounter and pass through the hour I came into the world, and have reached the final crisis. This is, to my mind, more satisfactory; the interrogative prayer gives a sentimental character to the utterance out of harmony with the theme. Godet thinks that the fact that, according to the synoptists, our Lord in the garden <span class="accented">did</span> actually offer the prayer which he <span class="accented">here</span> hesitates to present, is evidence of the historic character of both accounts. I differ from him, because the sublime answer to the prayer here given would seem to preclude the necessity of the final conflict. The circumstance that he <span class="accented">did</span> offer the prayer as interpreted above, a prayer which was veritably heard, is in harmony with the narrative of the agony. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:27-33 The sin of our souls was the troubled of Christ's soul, when he undertook to redeem and save us, and to make his soul an offering for our sin. Christ was willing to suffer, yet prayed to be saved from suffering. Prayer against trouble may well agree with patience under it, and submission to the will of God in it. Our Lord Jesus undertook to satisfy God's injured honour, and he did it by humbling himself. The voice of the Father from heaven, which had declared him to be his beloved Son, at his baptism, and when he was transfigured, was heard proclaiming that He had both glorified his name, and would glorify it. Christ, reconciling the world to God by the merit of his death, broke the power of death, and cast out Satan as a destroyer. Christ, bringing the world to God by the doctrine of his cross, broke the power of sin, and cast out Satan as a deceiver. The soul that was at a distance from Christ, is brought to love him and trust him. Jesus was now going to heaven, and he would draw men's hearts to him thither. There is power in the death of Christ to draw souls to him. We have heard from the gospel that which exalts free grace, and we have heard also that which enjoins duty; we must from the heart embrace both, and not separate them.</body></html>
