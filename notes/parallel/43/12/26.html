This verse makes it equally certain that the law is applied to those who follow Him. The point of the whole teaching is missed unless we think of the Greeks as present. They had come as volunteer disciples. Did they know what the discipleship was? Were they prepared to follow Him in self-sacrifice, that through sacrifice they may obtain eternal life? It had been the condition of earlier discipleship. It is laid down for the new disciples, but in the presence of the older ones who in the dark days that have now come were to learn what sacrifice meant. The Greeks needed no less than the Hebrews to learn it; the men of a wider civilisation and more philosophic thought no less than the fishermen of Galilee and the scribes of Jerusalem. All self-seeking, whether in the coarser forms of pleasure and power or in the more refined forms of emotion and thought, is self-loving; all self-sacrifice, whether in the daily round of duty to man or in the devotion of the whole self to God, is self-saving. Self-seeking is always akin to, and ofttimes one with, hatred of others; and hatred is death. Self-sacrifice is akin to, and one with, love to others; and love is life.<p><span class= "bld">And where I am, there shall also my servant be.</span>--This is an anticipation of the glory of the Son of man for which the hour had already come. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">If any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</span>--The condition is the same as in the first clause of the verse, the difference of that which follows upon the condition again bringing out in the fulness of its meaning the law of life through sacrifice:<p>"If any man serve Me,"<p>{<p>"let him follow Me" . . .<p>}<p>"he that hateth his life in this world"<p>"him will my Father honour" . . .<p>}<p>"shall keep it unto life eternal."<p>The honour of the servant after his work is done is in the same relation to that work as the glory of the Son of man is to His work. This honour will consist in his being where the Son of man is; and this will be the Father's gift (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - In this verse the Lord brings the light of heaven down into this deep paradox. He speaks like an anointed King and great Captain of salvation, who has (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) "servants" willing to do his bidding. <span class="cmt_word">If any man will be my servant, let him follow me</span> along the line which I am prepared to take, in the way of sacrifice and death, which is the true glorification; <span class="cmt_word">and where I am, there shall also my servant be</span>. This association of the servant with the Lord, as the sufficient and the transcendent motive, pervades the Gospels (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a> and John 17:24; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>, "with me in Paradise;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). It is remarkable that Christ chose the twelve that they should be "with him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>). There is no greater blessedness. Still, the Lord adds, <span class="cmt_word">If any man serve me, him will the Father honor.</span> For the Father to honor a poor child of the dust seems almost more than we can receive. The conception of the steps by means of which the Lord makes this possible to his followers and servants produced in his own self-consciousness one of those sudden and overwhelming crises and changes from joy to perturbation, as of agony to peace and to reconcilement with the eternal Father's will, which prove how certainly St. John is always portraying the same Personage, the same transcendent character whom the synoptists describe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-49.htm">Luke 12:49, 50</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-38.htm">Luke 19:38, 41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>, etc., and 21). More than this, the whole passage that follows is a solemn prelude to that agony of the garden which the synoptists alone record, while they omit this. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:20-26 In attendance upon holy ordinances, particularly the gospel passover, the great desire of our souls should be to see Jesus; to see him as ours, to keep up communion with him, and derive grace from him. The calling of the Gentiles magnified the Redeemer. A corn of wheat yields no increase unless it is cast into the ground. Thus Christ might have possessed his heavenly glory alone, without becoming man. Or, after he had taken man's nature, he might have entered heaven alone, by his own perfect righteousness, without suffering or death; but then no sinner of the human race could have been saved. The salvation of souls hitherto, and henceforward to the end of time, is owing to the dying of this Corn of wheat. Let us search whether Christ be in us the hope of glory; let us beg him to make us indifferent to the trifling concerns of this life, that we may serve the Lord Jesus with a willing mind, and follow his holy example.</body></html>
