(Comp. Note there.) They may have referred to such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm" title="His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.">Psalm 89:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13-14</a>. This remark is an instance of the knowledge of Rabbinic theology which interpreted such passages of a temporal Messianic reign. They had witnessed His triumphal entry into the royal city, and had joined in the acclamations which hailed Him as their King. They expected Him to free them from Roman bondage, and to rule over them in an earthly paradise to which there should be no end. The Christ they thought was to abide for ever.<p><span class= "bld">How sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted</span> up?--His words have conveyed to them the idea of His death, and we find "lifted up" used not unfrequently in the Rabbinical writings in this sense; but they do not understand more than this. It contradicts all their visions of a Messianic reign. The Son of man to be lifted up! What meant, then, such words as these--"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>)? They cannot reconcile these things, and they ask Him to explain them.<p>He had not at this time used the exact words they quote, if St. John has given to us the conversation in full, but they occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14</a>, and the title "Son of man" occurs in this context in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm" title="And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.">John 12:23</a>. It was, moreover, present to their thoughts from the passage in Daniel, and must have been familiarly known as used by Christ of Himself. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Who is this Son of man?</span>--"Who is <span class= "ital">this</span> Son of man?" they would say. "We know who is the Son of man who is to abide for ever, but this Son of man who is to die we know not." The words express that they are wavering in their attachment to Him. The question was asked probably on the Wednesday. It came midway between the "Hosanna" of the entry into Jerusalem and the "Crucify him!" of the trial.<p>The words are remarkable as throwing light upon the sudden changes of feeling which swayed the multitude from the pole of faith to that of rejection. They heard words from Christ or saw works done by Him which carried conviction to all minds; but then there came some technical interpretation of an Old Testament passage declaring what the Messiah was to be, and in the cooler moments, when no word was speaking to the ear and no work presented itself to the eye, this test seemed fatal to the claim, and disbelief took the place of belief, and hatred that of love. We have met this again and again in the case of the priests and Pharisees. They did not, we may well believe, during the last days, leave any means untried by which they might move the fickle minds of the masses. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-20.htm" title="But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.">Matthew 27:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - The audience of Jesus on this occasion has swollen into a vast group. The few Greeks, with Philip and Andrew, the other disciples, the smaller circle of sympathetic <span class="accented">listeners</span>, the disturbed and feverish crowd, are all about him, as he claims by death itself to judge the world, to win all men, and east out the spirit and prince of the world from his usurped throne. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude then</span> <span class="cmt_word">answered him, We heard</span> - received information by public teaching - <span class="cmt_word">out of the Law that the Christ abideth forever.</span> Numerous passages may have been reasonably in their minds - <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a> - in which the glories of an everlasting kingdom were predicted. In ver. 23 the Lord had in their hearing spoken of himself as "Son of man." Meyer, by giving the dominant sense of glorification to the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>, thinks <span class="accented">that</span> the people must be contrasting, in pert criticism, the lowly "Son of man" before them with the "Son of man" of Daniel's vision. But it would be far more probable that the people accepted Christ's intimation of the manner of his death, and hence felt the incongruity of such a Son of man - One who dies, and therefore lives again - with the glowing pictures of Daniel or the 'Book of Henoch.' "The Christ abideth forever." <span class="cmt_word">And how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span> They did not identify "the Son of man" with the Messiah. They probably supposed two manifestations. They may have doubted, as John the Baptist did, whether Jesus had fulfilled the whole conception of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It was once more a vague, dull inquiry, "Who art thou?" We are still in doubt who thou art, and how thou canst claim to be the Christ of our prophecies. To be our Christ, and die, is a contradiction in terms. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:34-36 The people drew false notions from the Scriptures, because they overlooked the prophecies that spoke of Christ's sufferings and death. Our Lord warned them that the light would not long continue with them, and exhorted them to walk in it, before the darkness overtook them. Those who would walk in the light must believe in it, and follow Christ's directions. But those who have not faith, cannot behold what is set forth in Jesus, lifted up on the cross, and must be strangers to its influence as made known by the Holy Spirit; they find a thousand objections to excuse their unbelief.</body></html>
