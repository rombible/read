He had given our Lord's closing word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-36.htm" title="While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.">John 12:36</a>, and there stated that He hid Himself from them. He now gives other words of our Lord condemning the unbelief of which he had been speaking, and of which the probable explanation is that they are a summary of words previously uttered by our Lord, but grouped together here as specially bearing upon the subject of which he is writing. For the remaining verses of this chapter, the Notes will therefore consist chiefly of reference to earlier passages where the same words have already occurred.<p>(44) <span class= "bld">Jesus cried and said.</span>--Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>. This forbids our understanding these words of any private discourse addressed to the disciples. The phrase implies public teaching addressed to the multitude, and it may be inferred that there was some such teaching after <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-36.htm" title="While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.">John 12:36</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-50.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> The <span class="accented">summation of the supreme conflict between our Lord and the world</span>. The portion of the chapter which follows is regarded by most commentators, Lucke, Meyer, Godet, Olshausen, and Westcott, as a summary of our Lord's teaching, as a reiteration by the evangelist of those salient points of the Lord's ministry which, while they are the life of the world, are nevertheless the grounds on which blinded eyes and hardened hearts rejected him. Vers. 44-46 characterize the believer; vers. 47, 48 emphasize Christ's relation to the unbeliever; vers. 49, 50 the principle upon which both deliverances turn and will continue to turn. There are those who think that these were special private addresses to the disciples, uttered after our Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>) was hidden, but the word (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>) "cried aloud," would not then have been used, as it was used for the most public expressions of his doctrine, when given once for all (here comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28, 37</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-39.htm">Luke 18:39</a>). Keim, De Wette, Baur, and Hilgenfeld think that, because there is no fresh departure here, it is proof that <span class="accented">all</span> the discourses of Christ in John are similarly put together with no historical basis. But if it be so, this differs strangely from all the rest of our Lord's discourses recorded by John in that it has no occasion, or persons, or opportunity to which it seems to fit. Certain aorists suggest the idea that John has here given specimens of our Lord's appeals which had ended in his being rejected by the nation as a whole. Luthardt takes the view of these words being spoken <span class="accented">totidem verbis</span> on our Lord's departure, and with him Hengstenberg also agrees. These critics suppose that they form the closing words of our Lord's public ministry, delayed by the intercalary remarks of the evangelist, and really belong to the close of the thirty-sixth verse. Though the expressions flint follow are built upon the discourses elsewhere uttered, we admit, with Hengstenberg, that there is no verbal parallel that is at all close, and that therefore the evangelist must not be quoting from what he had already reported, but giving the substance of a threefold class of observations found from one end of the Gospel to the other, and in words that he had heard the Master use. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44, 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me,PGBR> <span class="cmt_word">but on him that sent me; and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth him that sent me</span>. These words do not occur before, but in every form our Lord had exalted "him that sent him." His doctrine or teaching, his purpose in manifestation, the secret food that sustained him, the Divine presence that never left him alone, the entire background of the mission of his human will and life into the world, the object of faith to men as revealed in his humanity, and that which the spiritual eye ought to see, nay - if the beholder did but know it does see, constitute an unveiling of the eternal Father who sent him into the world (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17, 18, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 9, 24</a>). It becomes, then, of high value to grasp the truth. We actually believe in God when believing in him. His mission is lost in the glory of God who appears in him. So far as he is <span class="accented">sent</span>, he was necessarily of lower order and rank than he who sent him. His humanity began to be in time; it was generated in the womb of the Virgin; it was sanctified and sent into the world; and yet through it there was the highest revelation of the Father. We cannot attribute so stupendous a thought to the evangelist, and at the same time we admit the portentous singularity and uniqueness of the consciousness which could thus aver identity of nature with God and the completeness of revelation that the Speaker was making in himself of the Father. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:44-50 Our Lord publicly proclaimed, that every one who believed on him, as his true disciple, did not believe on him only, but on the Father who sent him. Beholding in Jesus the glory of the Father, we learn to obey, love, and trust in him. By daily looking to Him, who came a Light into the world, we are more and more freed from the darkness of ignorance, error, sin, and misery; we learn that the command of God our Saviour is everlasting life. But the same word will seal the condemnation of all who despise it, or neglect it.</body></html>
