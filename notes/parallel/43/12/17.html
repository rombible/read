The meaning of this text is that the Jews of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-9.htm" title="Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.">John 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-11.htm" title="Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.">John 12:11</a>, and those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-45.htm" title="Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.">John 11:45</a>, with the people of Bethany, bear witness of the event, the recurrence of which they had themselves seen; and that this testimony was received by the multitude of pilgrims who went forth therefore to receive Jesus as the Messiah. (Comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-37.htm" title="And when he was come near, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;">Luke 19:37</a>.) This interpretation makes the Jews of Jerusalem themselves the witnesses whose testimony leads the multitude to receive our Lord as the Christ.<p>If we take the alternative, but less probable text, the multitude in both verses will be one and the same.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - These verses connect the enthusiasm of the multitudes with the great miracle of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11.htm">John 11</a>, indicating a point concerning which the synoptic narrative is silent, and further they consociate the miracle and its effect upon the multitude with aggravation of the malignant feeling of the constituted authorities which leads to the capture and crucifixion of the Lord Jesus. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The multitude therefore which was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, were bearing witness.</span> The seventeenth verse goes back to <span class="accented">the</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">multitude</span> who are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the friends of Mary and Martha and to other inhabitants of Bethany, as well as visitors from Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-31.htm">John 11:31</a>). All these are involved in the explicit declaration, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <span class="accented">Which was with him when</span> <span class="accented">he called Lazarus out of his grave, and</span> (not only so, but) <span class="accented">raised him from among the dead</span>. Those who had actually beheld the miracle, and were as eye and ear witnesses of the event, who had hovered about Bethany since his return to it, - these <span class="accented">were bearing witness</span>. They spread themselves abroad in the crowd of Galilaean pilgrims and others, and were uttering their testimony on all sides. The word is used absolutely, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>, and the imperfect tense should not be turned here into a mere preterit. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-19 Christ's riding in triumph to Jerusalem is recorded by all the evangelists. Many excellent things, both in the word and providence of God, disciples do not understand at their first acquaintance with the things of God. The right understanding of spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, prevents our misapplying the Scriptures which speak of it.</body></html>
