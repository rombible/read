The disciples had heard them laid down as the law of their own life and work. They now hear the mysterious words again, and they are asserted as the law to which even His life is submitted. There is even in His human nature a physical and emotional life which would shrink from sacrifice and death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.">John 12:27</a>; comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a>), but in self-sacrifice and death is His own glory and the life of the world. There is in all human nature a principle which would seek as the highest good the life of the body and of the soul, as distinct from the higher life of the spirit, and would shrink from sacrifice and death; but the true principle of life is of the spirit, and only in the sacrifice of the desires of the lower physical and emotional life is that spiritual life realised.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - The Lord here introduces a solemn, almost oracular utterance, which proves how close and intimate is the relationship between the synoptics and the Fourth Gospel. On several great occasions our Lord has impressed this law of the Spirit of life upon his disciples. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37-39</a>, in the lengthened commission given to the twelve, after calling on his followers to place his own claim on their affection as greater than that of father, mother, friend, and calling for self-sacrifice, and self-crucifixion, he said, "He that findeth his life (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>) shall lose it: he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it." Again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a>, etc.), after rebuking Peter for his unwillingness to recognize the necessity and significance of the killing of "the Son of the living God," he laid down the same law once more, calling for self-denial and daily cross-bearing, and adds, "Whosoever will <span class="accented">save</span> his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it." So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>, etc. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-26.htm">Luke 15:26</a>) also introduces the same solemn aphorism in our Lord's discourse concerning the close of the Jewish national life. Surely here he is applying to his own case the law of the Divine life which he had shown to be universal, and of which he was on the point of giving the crowning and climacteric expression. He does it with amplifications and a supply of motives. If life be regarded as an end in itself; if it be treated as complete when rounded with its own individuality; if life shrink from sacrifice, if it "love itself," and will at all hazards preserve itself; if the natural and instinctive fear of death, and instinct of self-preservation, become a self-idolatry; - that life will "abide alone." If it sacrifice itself for higher ends than self; if it regard the higher end as more valuable than itself; if it lose itself in the object to which it is consecrated; if it be content to "die;" - it abideth no longer "alone," but "bringeth forth much fruit." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that loves his own life</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>); life used as equivalent to "self," in that totality of being which, like the life of the seed-corn, survives the accident of death - <span class="cmt_word">he that loves his own life</span> (<span class="accented">self</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word">is</span> losing</span> <span class="cmt_word">it</span>; or, perhaps, destroying it, <span class="accented">ipso facto</span>. There are ends and objects of love so much greater than" the self," that to keep it by some act of will and recreant fear is to make it utterly valueless, is really to destroy its true vitality. <span class="cmt_word">And he that hateth his</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">life</span> (<span class="accented">self</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in this world</span>, wherever the greater claim of Christ and of the Father would be compromised by loving it, <span class="cmt_word">shall</span> veritably <span class="cmt_word">preserve it</span>, viz. the self, <span class="cmt_word">unto eternal</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">life</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the blessedness of eternal being. The <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is a great possession; and "what advantageth a man if he should gain the whole world, and lose it?" But if a man persists in gaining the world, and forgets that this earthly existence is not capable of satisfying the demands or finding a sphere for the true self, and so makes the earthly reign or enjoyment of the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> the end of all striving, - then he miserably fails. So far it is clear that our Lord is applying a great principle of the true life to the case of his own Messianic work and ministry. He draws, from a law of the superiority of the Divine life to the fear of death and to the fact of death, a justification of his own approaching doom. He can only by dying live his perfect life, win his greatest triumph; reap his world-wide harvest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:20-26 In attendance upon holy ordinances, particularly the gospel passover, the great desire of our souls should be to see Jesus; to see him as ours, to keep up communion with him, and derive grace from him. The calling of the Gentiles magnified the Redeemer. A corn of wheat yields no increase unless it is cast into the ground. Thus Christ might have possessed his heavenly glory alone, without becoming man. Or, after he had taken man's nature, he might have entered heaven alone, by his own perfect righteousness, without suffering or death; but then no sinner of the human race could have been saved. The salvation of souls hitherto, and henceforward to the end of time, is owing to the dying of this Corn of wheat. Let us search whether Christ be in us the hope of glory; let us beg him to make us indifferent to the trifling concerns of this life, that we may serve the Lord Jesus with a willing mind, and follow his holy example.</body></html>
