The evangelist had said, in his prologue, "In him was life," and the Life (the eternal Logos of life) was "the Light of men." All true understanding, all purifying, gracious influence shed on human affairs, nature, or destiny, are the issue and result of the Divine Life which, under every dispensation, has wrought in humanity. Above all, "the Light that lighteth every man," namely, that which has always and which ever will radiate from the life conferred on our humanity by the Logos, the life of God in mind and conscience, "came into the world" - came, that is, in a new and more effective form, came in the radiance of a perfect human life. The evangelist has sustained his teaching by quoting the solemn words of Jesus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-5.htm">John 9:5</a>, where a special narrative of miraculous love typified both the need in which the human family, the sacred Israel, and even his own disciples, stood of light, and of the light which he could pour upon the sightless eyeballs. And now the connection of this passage is - You could not behold me if light did not stream forth from me. <span class="cmt_word">I have come</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">am come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, this has been and is my abiding purpose; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>) <span class="cmt_word">a Light into the world, and</span> my object has been and is that <span class="cmt_word">whosoever believeth on me</span> - whoso-ever sees by the inward eye that which I really am, sees how my life stands related to the Father, whosoever assents to the new revelation thus given, even over and above the "<span class="accented">inward</span> light" of the Logos - <span class="cmt_word">should not abide in the darkness</span> which enwraps all souls; for, as said in the prologue, "<span class="accented">the</span> Light" (the archetypal Light) shineth upon the darkness of human nature, and the darkness comprehendeth it not." It should be especially noticed that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a> St. Paul had grasped and uttered the fullness of this thought. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:44-50 Our Lord publicly proclaimed, that every one who believed on him, as his true disciple, did not believe on him only, but on the Father who sent him. Beholding in Jesus the glory of the Father, we learn to obey, love, and trust in him. By daily looking to Him, who came a Light into the world, we are more and more freed from the darkness of ignorance, error, sin, and misery; we learn that the command of God our Saviour is everlasting life. But the same word will seal the condemnation of all who despise it, or neglect it.</body></html>
