Our Lord claimed, in the sermon on the mount, to be the Executor of a judgment, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-29</a> he declared that he would be as Son of man, the final Adjudicator of doom on the disobedient (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>.), and in many places he made this thought even more solemn by speaking of himself on that occasion, not as the compassionate Savior, but the Administrator of an inviolable law, which cannot be swayed by immediate emotion, but will effectuate itself on eternal and unswerving principles.

Beholding in Jesus the glory of the Father, we learn to obey, love, and trust in him. By daily looking to Him, who came a Light into the world, we are more and more freed from the darkness of ignorance, error, sin, and misery; we learn that the command of God our Saviour is everlasting life. But the same word will seal the condemnation of all who despise it, or neglect it.</body></html>
