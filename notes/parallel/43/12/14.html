The others all give the incidents in detail. "Having found," does not imply that the colt was found without the search which the other Evangelists record. (Comp. the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-35.htm" title="Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?">John 9:35</a>.) It has been noted, as illustrating the fact, that the word "found" includes the sending the disciples to look for the colt, that it is the same Greek word which Archimedes used when he found the object of his search, and cried, <span class= "ital">Eureka! Eureka!</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written.</span> The whole account of the process by which our Lord secured this <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is described at great length by the synoptists (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-2.htm">Matthew 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-30.htm">Luke 19:30</a>). The foal implies that the animal had never borne another burden. The account of Matthew refers to the mother and the foal, as though they were inseparable, and together bore the sacred burden. Mr. Holman Hunt, in his picture of the 'Triumph of the Innocents,' has represented the beast bearing Mary and her Child as accompanied by the colt. The entire process of securing both must have taken time, and augmented the excitement. Christ at length, on the eve of his Passion which he so distinctly foreshadowed, allowed the enthusiasm of the people to prevail, and accepted the homage. The Galilee pilgrims take up the demonstration, which was commenced, as we see from John's Gospel, by "the Jews" and those Jerusalemites who had been profoundly moved by the significance of the resurrection of Lazarus. The circumstances thus elucidated from the four narratives, reveal undesigned coincidences. The entry into Jerusalem did not take place till the afternoon, and so we find that all that our Lord did on arrival was to "go to the temple, look round on all things, and, now that the even was come, to revisit Bethany with the twelve" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-19 Christ's riding in triumph to Jerusalem is recorded by all the evangelists. Many excellent things, both in the word and providence of God, disciples do not understand at their first acquaintance with the things of God. The right understanding of spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, prevents our misapplying the Scriptures which speak of it.</body></html>
