"It was on account of the divine will expressed in Isaiah's prophecy." "It was therefore, namely, because Isaiah said again."<p>The words, "they could not believe," must be taken in their plain meaning as expressing impossibility. The Apostle is looking back upon the national rejection of Christ, and seeks a reason for it. He remembers how our Lord Himself had explained His method of teaching by parables, and has based it upon this prophecy of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm" title="And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:">Matthew 13:14</a>). The principle was that which has been repeated in His last public words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-35.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come on you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.">John 12:35-36</a>); that power used is increased, and power neglected destroys itself. Here, then, in these prophetic words was the reason they could not believe. Wilful rejection had been followed by rejection which was no longer within the power of the will. With this statement of St. John's should be compared our Lord's words on the same subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-40.htm" title="And you will not come to me, that you might have life.">John 5:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>, Notes, and St. Paul's arguments in Romans 9-11.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 39, 40.</span> - In these verses, however, a deeper difficulty still is involved. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> leave us no option (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-21.htm">John 7:21, 22</a>) but to translate: <span class="cmt_word">For from this reason they were unable to believe</span> (see other illustrations of the usage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>). There was a moral impossibility inherited by them through ages of rebellion and insensibility to Divine grace, and through their misuse of Divine revelation. The issue of it was, "'they could not believe." <span class="cmt_word">Because Isaiah said again</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. in another place</span>; illustrative of this great Messianic oracle and the reception it would meet with from the nation as a whole. In the passage which follows we have a translation which does not directly correspond with either the Hebrew or the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a>. The prophet is bidden by the Lord to punish the people for their obduracy by blinding their eyes and hardening their heart, and even arresting the conversion and healing of the covenant people. This same solemn passage is quoted in four other places in the New Testament. Perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a> is hardly to be regarded as a citation; a small portion only of the passage is introduced from the prophet without reference to him, and this is inverted in order. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14, 15</a> there is the nearer approach to the LXX., which, however, transforms the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x5e2;</span>, "to hear, hear ye," into <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "by hearing ye shall hear;" and similarly with the other clauses, - the imperative of God's command to the prophet being resolved into the future of most certain accomplishment, and in place of "Lest they understand with their heart, and convert, and he [God] heal them," LXX. reads, "Lest... should convert, and I [who give you the command to deliver such a message, notwithstanding its results upon them] heal them." This St. Matthew has followed. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a> has given a different representation again, and, while omitting a considerable portion of the passage, passes to the climax, which is put thus: "Lest they should be converted, and their sin should be forgiven them," showing that the evangelist, looking to the Hebrew rather than to the LXX., has resolved its meaning into a clearly related paraphrase. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26, 27</a> the passage almost verbally follows the LXX. Here in the remarks of St. John the whole passage seems independent of the LXX., and to have resolved the Hebrew "imperative," addressed to the prophet, into an awful assurance of Divine agency in the matter. Instead of "shut their eyes," Hebrew imperative, or LXX. "their eyes they closed," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX., he says, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">He hath blinded their eyes</span>; and so with the other terms: <span class="cmt_word">He hardened</span> <span class="cmt_word">their heart; in order that they should not</span> (lest they should) <span class="cmt_word">see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and should turn, and I should heal them.</span> In <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> the evangelist, returning to the first person, draws a distinction between the retributive activity of the pre-existent Christ of the earlier revelation and the historical Savior. There is no slip or negligence. Godet and Hengstenberg go a long way in making God the Author of the sin and rejection, and the cause of the impossibility of their repentance and healing. That which in all the several quotations of this passage we learn from Isaiah's oracle is that the unforced and willful rejection of the Divine Word is visited by condign withdrawment of the faculty to receive even more accessible and apprehensible truth. This is the great law of Divine operation in the nature of all moral beings. This law is described as a distinctly foreseen event, and by LXX. as an apprehensible and even conspicuous fact, and it is quoted by St. John as the direct consequence of the Divine activity. He does not mean to say that, because Isaiah foretold this as a Divine reprobation, they, whether they would or not as individuals, were fated to die the death of blindness, but they could not believe, because, on the principle involved in Isaiah's predictions, the Divine government had fulfilled itself, had acted upon its universal law, and in consequence of vows and acts of willful disobedience, they had thus fallen into the curse that belongs to a neglect of the Divine. "They could not believe." Thus even now disinclination to God and to righteousness leads to moral incapacity. Sin is punished by its natural consequences: unbelief is punished by unsusceptibility to clearest evidence; prejudice by blindness; rejection of Divine love by inability to see it at its best. How is this natural evolution brought about? Surely by laws of God. What are these laws but God's ways of acting with all moral agents whatever? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:37-43 Observe the method of conversion implied here. Sinners are brought to see the reality of Divine things, and to have some knowledge of them. To be converted, and truly turned from sin to Christ, as their Happiness and Portion. God will heal them, will justify and sanctify them; will pardon their sins, which are as bleeding wounds, and mortify their corruptions, which are as lurking diseases. See the power of the world in smothering convictions, from regard to the applause or censure of men. Love of the praise of men, as a by-end in that which is good, will make a man a hypocrite when religion is in fashion, and credit is to be got by it; and love of the praise of men, as a base principle in that which is evil, will make a man an apostate, when religion is in disgrace, and credit is to be lost for it.</body></html>
