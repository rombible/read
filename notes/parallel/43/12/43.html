Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-44.htm" title="How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?">John 5:44</a>, where the truth is put in the form of a question by our Lord. Here it explains the fact that there were men who believed, and yet did not publicly confess their faith. There our Lord's question goes deeper, and asserts that the seeking of the glory which comes from men is inconsistent with the existence of any true belief in God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - The generalization is given as a reason, <span class="cmt_word">For they loved the glory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, very nearly in the original Greek use of the word," opinion," "good reputation") <span class="cmt_word">of men, very much more</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>, another New Testament, <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, occurring in the narrative portion of John, and a mode in which the negative force of the <span class="greek">&#x1f24;</span> is heightened; see Meyer, Jelf, p. 779, and English edition of Wirier, p. 549) <span class="cmt_word">than the glory of God</span>. The form of the expressions, "of God' and "of men," is different from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-44.htm">John 5:44</a>, and the statement is apparently inconsistent with the declaration that those in such a state of mind "could not believe." Moulton suggests that the glory here thought of by the apostle was the "glory" of ver. 41 - the glory of the union of the Redeemer with his people, the glory of suffering and death. The reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. appears to be the true solution. The glory of God himself in his awful holiness was of less interest than the glory of the Sanhedrin and the approval of the world. Alas! this glory is nearer, more obvious and has more to do with tangible, sensuous, advantages, than the Divine approval. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:37-43 Observe the method of conversion implied here. Sinners are brought to see the reality of Divine things, and to have some knowledge of them. To be converted, and truly turned from sin to Christ, as their Happiness and Portion. God will heal them, will justify and sanctify them; will pardon their sins, which are as bleeding wounds, and mortify their corruptions, which are as lurking diseases. See the power of the world in smothering convictions, from regard to the applause or censure of men. Love of the praise of men, as a by-end in that which is good, will make a man a hypocrite when religion is in fashion, and credit is to be got by it; and love of the praise of men, as a base principle in that which is evil, will make a man an apostate, when religion is in disgrace, and credit is to be lost for it.</body></html>
