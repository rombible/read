The mighty work, undertaken by him who would realize the expectations of the oldest prophets and the unconscious prophecies of heathendom, was done. Every iota and tittle of the Law had been magnified. The reality of which the temple and the sabbath were shadows, the priesthood and the offerings innumerable were figures, had all been realized. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>! Consummatum est! From the ground of human nature, from the heart of the Man in whom all the wants, perils, sins, mysteries of the human race were gathered up, has gone the adequate admission of the righteous judgment of God against that nature in its present condition. Death itself becomes, not his shame, but his veritable glory. The sin of humanity is branded with an eternal curse, more deep than any previous manifestation of the Divine justice could have produced; and yet it loses its sting. God reconciles the world to himself by the death of his Son, by this curse thus falling upon his Only Begotten. The earthly judges are condemned by their Victim. The great and last enemy is itself wounded unto death. The Seed of the woman bruises the serpent's head when that Seed receives the bruise in its own heel. The Paschal Lamb is slain. The Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world. The prince of this world is east out. The reader must turn to the synoptic narrative for the other portents of the Crucifixion - the earthquake, the supernatural darkness, the rending of the temple veil, and the testimony of the Roman centurion. The silence of the Fourth Gospel concerning these events, on the supposition of its late orion, or on the hypothesis of the glorifying myth, or upon the suggestion that this evangelist was a theologizing mystic of the second century, who was merely fashioning the narrative to establish the doctrinal thesis of the Divine incarnation of the Logos, becomes entirely unintelligible. But the hypothesis that this eye-witness was supplementing other well-known narratives with particulars which came forcibly under his own observation, and made a deep impression upon his own mind, is suggested by every line. Dr. Westcott places "the seven words from the cross" in the following order: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">Before the darkness</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"><br />(2)</span> "Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"><br />(3)</span> "Woman, behold thy son:... behold thy mother!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">During the darkness</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="accented">After the darkness</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> "I thirst" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"><br />(6)</span> "It is finished!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"><br />(7)</span> "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>). It is a question whether the sixth or seventh word is the more triumphant. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:19-30 Here are some remarkable circumstances of Jesus' death, more fully related than before. Pilate would not gratify the chief priests by allowing the writing to be altered; which was doubtless owing to a secret power of God upon his heart, that this statement of our Lord's character and authority might continue. Many things done by the Roman soldiers were fulfilments of the prophecies of the Old Testament. All things therein written shall be fulfilled. Christ tenderly provided for his mother at his death. Sometimes, when God removes one comfort from us, he raises up another for us, where we looked not for it. Christ's example teaches all men to honour their parents in life and death; to provide for their wants, and to promote their comfort by every means in their power. Especially observe the dying word wherewith Jesus breathed out his soul. It is finished; that is, the counsels of the Father concerning his sufferings were now fulfilled. It is finished; all the types and prophecies of the Old Testament, which pointed at the sufferings of the Messiah, were accomplished. It is finished; the ceremonial law is abolished; the substance is now come, and all the shadows are done away. It is finished; an end is made of transgression by bringing in an everlasting righteousness. His sufferings were now finished, both those of his soul, and those of his body. It is finished; the work of man's redemption and salvation is now completed. His life was not taken from him by force, but freely given up.</body></html>
