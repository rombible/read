But Jesus gave him no answer.">John 19:9</a>. He hesitates no longer about the course to be taken. His own position and life may be in danger, and he prepares, therefore, to pronounce the final sentence, which must necessarily be done from the public judgment seat outside the palace. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-19.htm" title="When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.">Matthew 27:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span>--Both these words occur here only, and are instances of the writer's minute knowledge of the localities in Jerusalem. It may have been better to have preserved the Greek name (<span class= "ital">Lithostr?ton</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> as well as that by which the place was known in the Hebrew (Syro-Chaldaic) of the time. The word literally means "stone-paved," and was the Greek name for the tesselated "pavement" of marble and coloured stones with which from the time of Sylla the Romans delighted to adorn the Praetorium. The Chaldee word means "an elevated place," so that the one name was given to it from its <span class= "ital">form,</span> and the other from the material of which it was made. Suetonius (<span class= "ital">Life,</span> chap. 46) tells us that Julius Caesar carried about with him such pieces of marble and stone, but the mention of the <span class= "ital">"</span>place" bears the impression that it was a fixture in front of the Praetorium at Jerusalem, in which the Bema was placed; or it may have been a portion of the northern court of the sanctuary to which Pilate came out, if we identify the Praetorium with the tower Antonia. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-27.htm" title="Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered to him the whole band of soldiers.">Matthew 27:27</a>.) Josephus mentions that the whole of the Temple mountain was paved with this kind of Mosaic work (<span class= "ital">Ant</span> v. 5. 2. Caspari, <span class= "ital">Chron. Geogr., Introd.,</span> Eng. Trans., p. 225).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Pilate therefore heard these words,</span> or, sayings his fear of Tiberius became greater than his fear of Christ; his anxiety for himself predominated over his desire for justice and fair play. He found he had gone too far. Some commentators and harmonists here introduce the "hand-washing" (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-40.htm">John 18:40</a>); but such a proceeding at this moment, when he was straightening up his back for the last act of injustice, would have roused fresh and dangerous charges against his personal honor. <span class="cmt_word">He brought Jesus out</span> from the Praetorium to a place in view of the peoples <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">sat down</span> (not, as some say, caused Jesus, in mockery, to take his place upon the judgment-seat (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> has the transitive sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, but not in John; and undoubtedly it has the intransitive sense, not only in John, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-6.htm">Acts 25:6, 17</a>. Moreover, the mockery was the act of the soldiery and of Herod's men of war, not of Pilate). It is remarkable, as Dr. James Drummond (Theological Review, 1877) points out, that Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 1:35) apparently refers to this supposed transitive usage of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> in this very connection by John, by the words, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. It is reasonable inference that Justin read John's Gospel, and supposed him to give transitive force to the verb (see Dr. Salmon, 'Introduction to New Testament,' p. 89, note). <span class="cmt_word">Upon the judgment-seat in a place called</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the tessellated <span class="cmt_word">Pavement</span> - equivalent to "stone-joining" - in which Romans delighted from the days of Sulla; a decoration which Julius Caesar carried about with him (Suet., 'Vit.,' 46.) for purposes of judgment - <span class="cmt_word">but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha</span>. This was probably an elevated and fixed platform overlooking the temple-courts, or joining the Castle of Antonia with the temple. Its etymology is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, the ridge of the house or temple. Ewald has endeavored to find in the word the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, Aramaic for "insert," modified into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;</span>, and then to suppose that we have here an exact equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; but where this word occurs in the LXX. it is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-10.htm">Song of Solomon 3:10</a>. The <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was possibly some elevated seat reached by a flight of stairs, and in the open air, not the bema within the Praetorium, where the more private conversations took place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-18 Little did Pilate think with what holy regard these sufferings of Christ would, in after-ages, be thought upon and spoken of by the best and greatest of men. Our Lord Jesus came forth, willing to be exposed to their scorn. It is good for every one with faith, to behold Christ Jesus in his sufferings. Behold him, and love him; be still looking unto Jesus. Did their hatred sharpen their endeavours against him? and shall not our love for him quicken our endeavours for him and his kingdom? Pilate seems to have thought that Jesus might be some person above the common order. Even natural conscience makes men afraid of being found fighting against God. As our Lord suffered for the sins both of Jews and Gentiles, it was a special part of the counsel of Divine Wisdom, that the Jews should first purpose his death, and the Gentiles carry that purpose into effect. Had not Christ been thus rejected of men, we had been for ever rejected of God. Now was the Son of man delivered into the hands of wicked and unreasonable men. He was led forth for us, that we might escape. He was nailed to the cross, as a Sacrifice bound to the altar. The Scripture was fulfilled; he did not die at the altar among the sacrifices, but among criminals sacrificed to public justice. And now let us pause, and with faith look upon Jesus. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? See him bleeding, see him dying, see him and love him! love him, and live to him!</body></html>
