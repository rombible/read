In the original the words for "accomplished" and "fulfilled" are derived from the same root, and the latter word is not the ordinary formula of quotation which we have had, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a> (see Note there). The Vulgate has "Postea sciens Jesus quia omnia <span class= "ital">consummata</span> sunt ut <span class= "ital">consummaretur</span> Scriptural Perhaps the nearest English rendering is "that all things were now completed that the Scripture might be accomplished." But then there arises the difficult question, Is this connected with the words which follow, or not? The margin assumes that it is, and refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm" title="They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.">Psalm 69:21</a>. On the other hand (1) St. John's custom is to quote the fulfilment of Scripture as seen in the event after its occurrence; (2) he does not here use the ordinary words which accompany such a reference; (3) the actual meaning of "knowing that all things were now accomplished" seems to exclude the idea of a further accomplishment, and to refer to the whole life which was an accomplishment of Scripture; (4) the context of words as they occur in the Psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-22.htm" title="Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.">John 19:22</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) cannot be understood of our Lord. There seems to be good reason, therefore, for understanding the words "that the Scripture might be completed," of the events of the whole life, and not of the words which immediately follow.<p><span class= "bld">I thirst.</span>--He had refused the usual stupefying drink at the moment of crucifixion (comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm" title="They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.">Matthew 27:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-48.htm" title="And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.">Matthew 27:48</a>), but now all has been accomplished, the moment of His departure is at hand, and He seeks relief from the physical agony of the thirst caused by His wounds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - (c) "I thirst" - the last agony. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - It does not come within the purpose of John to record the portents which attended the final scene - either the supernatural darkness on the one hand, or the rending of the veil of the temple on the other. He does not record the visions of the saints, nor the testimony of the centurion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45-56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-33.htm">Mark 15:33-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44-49</a>). He does not record the further quotation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>; the cry, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" nor the misinterpretation of the multitudes; nor the jeer at his dying agonies. But he does record two of the words of the Lord, which they had omitted. He, moreover, implies that he had purposely left these omissions to be filled up from the synoptists, for he adds, <span class="cmt_word">After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had been</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">now finished, said, I thirst, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> John heard in this word the comprehensive cry which gathered up all the yearnings and agonies of his soul, which fulfilled its travail, which expressed the awful significance of his suffering, and strangely filled up the prophetic picture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:19-30 Here are some remarkable circumstances of Jesus' death, more fully related than before. Pilate would not gratify the chief priests by allowing the writing to be altered; which was doubtless owing to a secret power of God upon his heart, that this statement of our Lord's character and authority might continue. Many things done by the Roman soldiers were fulfilments of the prophecies of the Old Testament. All things therein written shall be fulfilled. Christ tenderly provided for his mother at his death. Sometimes, when God removes one comfort from us, he raises up another for us, where we looked not for it. Christ's example teaches all men to honour their parents in life and death; to provide for their wants, and to promote their comfort by every means in their power. Especially observe the dying word wherewith Jesus breathed out his soul. It is finished; that is, the counsels of the Father concerning his sufferings were now fulfilled. It is finished; all the types and prophecies of the Old Testament, which pointed at the sufferings of the Messiah, were accomplished. It is finished; the ceremonial law is abolished; the substance is now come, and all the shadows are done away. It is finished; an end is made of transgression by bringing in an everlasting righteousness. His sufferings were now finished, both those of his soul, and those of his body. It is finished; the work of man's redemption and salvation is now completed. His life was not taken from him by force, but freely given up.</body></html>
