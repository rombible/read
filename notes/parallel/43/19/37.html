The Greek translation (LXX.) of the prophet avoided the strong word "pierced," as applied to Jehovah, and substituted for it "insulted." St. John translates the original Hebrew freely for himself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm" title="Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.">Revelation 1:7</a>), and gives the undoubted meaning of the Hebrew word, translating it by the same Greek word which is used by Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus. He thinks of the prophecy which spoke of Jehovah as pierced by His people, and sees it fulfilled in the Messiah pierced on the cross.<p>For the fulfilment of the prophecy, comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>. Jewish Rabbis, and Greek proselytes, and Roman soldiers alike looked, as they stood before the cross, on Him whom they pierced. That scene is typical. He shall draw all men unto Him, and the moral power over the heart of humanity will be the heart of love, which loves and therefore saves him that has pierced it through and through. "God commendeth His love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And again another Scripture saith</span>. The second of the Old Testament quotations is in several ways important and noteworthy. <span class="cmt_word">They shall look on him whom they pierced</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The original passage is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "They shall look upon me whom they pierced." The evangelist altered the ME into HIM, which, as it stands in the old oracle, and regarded as the language of Jehovah, is sufficiently surprising. The LXX. had felt the difficulty, and translated it <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "They shall look towards me, because they have insulted me." Their repentance and misgiving shall be aroused, because in response for those things which they have done contemptuously against me. It is interesting to see that John is more accurate in his Greek translation of this prophetic passage, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;</span>, "They shall look" with love and grace and repentance "on him whom (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) they pierced." This Greek rendering of the Hebrew is followed by Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus, and is quoted by Justin Martyr; it is also found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, forming a link of connection between the Gospel and the Apocalypse. Moreover, it is most impressive to find that the awful tragedy does not close even in the hands of this writer without a word of promise and hope. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-8.htm">Zechariah 12:8-14</a> is clearly in the mind of the apostle. The merciful Lord waits for the repentance of Israel, of those who, by instigating Roman power for his destruction, pierced him by their trenchant ingratitude as well as by the Roman spear. It will be fulfilled more completely when every eye shall see him, and the full revelation of his majesty shall smite the whole world with penitence or despair. This remarkable event and its issue, whatever may have been the precise physiological fact, establishes: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The autoptic testimony of one who scarcely expected to be credited with the result of his observation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The genuine humanity of our Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The more than humanity of his manner of death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The fact of his death, and therefore the reality of the Resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The symbolic and twofold aspect of his redemptive act. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The fulfillment of prophetic word. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The establishment of the connection between the Passover sacrifice and the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:31-37 A trial was made whether Jesus was dead. He died in less time than persons crucified commonly did. It showed that he had laid down his life of himself. The spear broke up the very fountains of life; no human body could survive such a wound. But its being so solemnly attested, shows there was something peculiar in it. The blood and water that flowed out, signified those two great benefits which all believers partake of through Christ, justification and sanctification; blood for atonement, water for purification. They both flow from the pierced side of our Redeemer. To Christ crucified we owe merit for our justification, and Spirit and grace for our sanctification. Let this silence the fears of weak Christians, and encourage their hopes; there came both water and blood out of Jesus' pierced side, both to justify and sanctify them. The Scripture was fulfilled, in Pilate's not allowing his legs to be broken, Ps 34:20. There was a type of this in the paschal lamb, Ex 12:46. May we ever look to Him, whom, by our sins, we have ignorantly and heedlessly pierced, nay, sometimes against convictions and mercies; and who shed from his wounded side both water and blood, that we might be justified and sanctified in his name.</body></html>
