It is not otherwise clear that its purpose was, or that its effect would be, to cause death, but this is the impression we derive from the present context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-33.htm" title="But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:">John 19:33</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-37.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <span class="accented">The piercing of the side, with its significance - the final close of the life of earth.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation; that is, the day before the sabbath</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-42.htm">Mark 15:42</a>). This note of time certainly blends both the synoptists and John in the assurance that the crucifixion took place on a Friday. It was also, according to the previous statement, the preparation of the Passover, which, we have seen, is better understood in that literal sense than in the sense of "the Friday of Passover week." Consequently, there was a twofold sanctity about that particular sabbath, seeing that the sabbatic rest of the day following the Paschal meal coincided with the ordinary weekly sabbath; (<span class="cmt_word">for great, or high, was the day of that sabbath</span>) (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-16.htm">Exodus 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-7.htm">Leviticus 23:7</a>; and notes on John 13:1; 18:28; 19:14). It was a "great" and "high" day in a sense far more profoundly impressive than any that could be derived from the ceremonial enactments of the Hebrew code. The sabbath of his rest came at length. The toil, the agony, are over, the whole world is transformed during its hours into his resting-place. There has been no such sabbath since the creative Word rested from all his work. <span class="cmt_word">In order that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath.</span> This statement, with the events which followed, strongly confirms our interpretation of the day of the Crucifixion. The Jews would scarcely have justified a crucifixion on the first sabbatic day of the feast, if they shrank from the proceeding here described as in danger of taking place on the ordinary sabbath. They follow the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a>) so far as it would apply, and hasten the dissolution of the crucified, if it had not already occurred. (They) <span class="cmt_word">asked Pilate that their legs might be broken</span> (crushed) [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, the same as aorist passive, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> (Winer, Eng. trans., p. 85), <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, first aorist passive], <span class="cmt_word">and that they might be taken away, as polluting corpses</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, equivalent to crurifragium, is a Roman custom, as it is clearly established by numerous authorities (Suet., 'Aug.,' 67; Seneca, ' De Ira.,' 3:32; see Wettstein); - a brutal custom, which added to the cruel shame and torment, even though it hastened the end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:31-37 A trial was made whether Jesus was dead. He died in less time than persons crucified commonly did. It showed that he had laid down his life of himself. The spear broke up the very fountains of life; no human body could survive such a wound. But its being so solemnly attested, shows there was something peculiar in it. The blood and water that flowed out, signified those two great benefits which all believers partake of through Christ, justification and sanctification; blood for atonement, water for purification. They both flow from the pierced side of our Redeemer. To Christ crucified we owe merit for our justification, and Spirit and grace for our sanctification. Let this silence the fears of weak Christians, and encourage their hopes; there came both water and blood out of Jesus' pierced side, both to justify and sanctify them. The Scripture was fulfilled, in Pilate's not allowing his legs to be broken, Ps 34:20. There was a type of this in the paschal lamb, Ex 12:46. May we ever look to Him, whom, by our sins, we have ignorantly and heedlessly pierced, nay, sometimes against convictions and mercies; and who shed from his wounded side both water and blood, that we might be justified and sanctified in his name.</body></html>
