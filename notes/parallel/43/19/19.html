Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-37.htm" title="And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Matthew 27:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-26.htm" title="And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Mark 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-38.htm" title="And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Luke 23:38</a>. St. John speaks of the <span class= "ital">title</span> placed over the cross. This was the common Roman name for an inscription of the kind, which was meant to give information of the crime for which the sentence of crucifixion had been given. St. Matthew calls it the "accusation;" St. Mark, "the superscription of the accusation;" St. Luke, "the superscription." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-38.htm" title="And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Luke 23:38</a>.) The inscription varies in word, though not in sense, in each of the narratives; <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Evangelists, in dealing with a written inscription, in which there could have been neither doubt nor difficulty, have not been careful to give us the exact words. The fact is significant, as bearing upon the literary characteristics of the Gospels, and upon the value which the writers set upon exact accuracy in unimportant details. The reason of the variations may, of course, be traced to the fact that one or more of the accounts may be a translation from the Hebrew inscription.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-22.</span> - (b) The title on the cross <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The evangelist turns to an event of which the synoptists say little, and quietly attribute to the Jews themselves. John, from the special access which he had to information about the high priest and the court of Pilate, says, <span class="cmt_word">Now Pilate wrote a title also</span> (the Latin technical word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used in preference to the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, "superscription"), <span class="cmt_word">and he put it,</span> by the hands of his own soldiers, <span class="cmt_word">on the cross.</span> We cannot translate <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> as a pluperfect, and therefore it becomes probable that after the procession had gone howling and cursing away to Golgotha, he had had the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, prepared. <span class="cmt_word">And there was written</span> upon the parchment, or the tablet, in letters all could read, <span class="cmt_word">JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS</span>, thus Pilate resolved to sting these murderous Jews to the last point of exasperation, in harmony with the character given him by Philo-Judaeus; but perhaps this motive was also stimulated by another - though he sought to punish their pride with scorn and scoff at their hypocritical charge, he may have had some strange irresistible conviction that there was reality in the royal supremacy of this marvelous Being, who throughout was conspicuously triumphant in his patient dignity. He seems muttering to himself, "Let him be Chief of malefactors, but he is and will be King of the Jews nevertheless, and I do not ignore the memories of either David or Solomon, Zerubbabel, Hyrcanus, or Idumaean Herod." The title differs slightly in its phrase in the four evangelists, yet they all preserve literatim the central fact of the change, "the King of the Jews." John alone mentions the circumstance, which may explain the minute differences (so Gresswell, 'Diss.,' 42.), viz. that it was written in three languages, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the vernacular, or "Hebrew;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the official, or "Latin;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the speech generally understood by all strangers, or "Greek." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The minute differences may be represented by Matthew using the Hebrew, Mark the Latin, and Luke and John the Greek, the latter simply adding the personal name of the crucified. Whether this hypothesis explaining the "this is" of Matthew, the "Rex Judaeorum" of Mark, the "this" of Luke, and the fuller statement of John, which gives what was contained in one of the languages, be verified or not, it should be observed that the four evangelists agree as to the verbatim form of the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, John more abundantly supplementing the information by recording the full <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Even Strauss does not regard these differences as discrepancies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:19-30 Here are some remarkable circumstances of Jesus' death, more fully related than before. Pilate would not gratify the chief priests by allowing the writing to be altered; which was doubtless owing to a secret power of God upon his heart, that this statement of our Lord's character and authority might continue. Many things done by the Roman soldiers were fulfilments of the prophecies of the Old Testament. All things therein written shall be fulfilled. Christ tenderly provided for his mother at his death. Sometimes, when God removes one comfort from us, he raises up another for us, where we looked not for it. Christ's example teaches all men to honour their parents in life and death; to provide for their wants, and to promote their comfort by every means in their power. Especially observe the dying word wherewith Jesus breathed out his soul. It is finished; that is, the counsels of the Father concerning his sufferings were now fulfilled. It is finished; all the types and prophecies of the Old Testament, which pointed at the sufferings of the Messiah, were accomplished. It is finished; the ceremonial law is abolished; the substance is now come, and all the shadows are done away. It is finished; an end is made of transgression by bringing in an everlasting righteousness. His sufferings were now finished, both those of his soul, and those of his body. It is finished; the work of man's redemption and salvation is now completed. His life was not taken from him by force, but freely given up.</body></html>
