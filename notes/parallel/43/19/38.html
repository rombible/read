This "Joseph" is introduced with the article (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span>), and a second before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>, implying to the reader that he is now. by reason of thesynoptic narrative, a well-known person. This Arimathsea is probably the Ramathaim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, the birthplace of Samuel, known now as the Nebi Samwil, about two leagues north-west of Jerusalem (Caspari, &sect; 49). Hengstenberg thinks the site is Ramleh, eight hours from Jerusalem. The maps of the Palest. Explor. Fund place it about a league to the east of Bethlehem. He was a "rich man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57</a>) - a fact which the First Gospel recalls without quoting the remarkable oracle of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, that Messiah, Servant of Jehovah, was with the "rich in his death." We may judge that Joseph had a residence in Jerusalem, even though he may still be known as belonging to and "from" Arimathaea, because he bad prepared, hard by the metropolis, a sepulcher which as yet had never been used. He was, moreover, a <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-50.htm">Luke 23:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>), a member of the Sanhedrin, of high character, "good and just.... waiting for, expecting the kingdom of God' (say Mark and Luke), "and by no means consentient to the counsel and deed of his colleagues" (adds Luke). The whole position is briefly put by John: <span class="cmt_word">Being a disciple of Jesus, but a hidden one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), who had been concealed as such up to this crowning climax of his Lord's humiliation, not daring to confess Christ, <span class="cmt_word">by reason of his fear of the Jews</span>. Strange that he and Nicodemus should have cast away their fears at such a moment! <span class="cmt_word">Joseph asked of Pilate</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); a word that implies something of claim and confidence on his part. The synoptists all three use <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, which rather denotes the position of a suppliant for a favor. <span class="cmt_word">That he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave.</span> This is supposed by some, who are anxious to make difficulties where none exist, that (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>) Pilate had already given permission for the crurifragium, and yet was astonished that he was dead already. The statement of Mark is perfectly consistent with this and with the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 31. Joseph, when all the transactions were over, sought for himself the privilege of a friend to take the body and bury it. Roman law permitted this privilege to friends; as Luthardt says, "The Christian martyrs of Rome were often buried in the catacombs." Not until death was obvious was it lawful to remove a body from the cross. The death had taken place; the Jews were prepared with Pilate's authorization to remove the corpse to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom. Joseph comes with a permission to take the corpse for honorable burial. <span class="cmt_word">He came therefore</span> - by reason of the permission - <span class="cmt_word">and took</span> <span class="cmt_word">the body</span> (of Jesus). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:38-42 Joseph of Arimathea was a disciple of Christ in secret. Disciples should openly own themselves; yet some, who in lesser trials have been fearful, in greater have been courageous. When God has work to do, he can find out such as are proper to do it. The embalming was done by Nicodemus, a secret friend to Christ, though not his constant follower. That grace which at first is like a bruised reed, may afterward resemble a strong cedar. Hereby these two rich men showed the value they had for Christ's person and doctrine, and that it was not lessened by the reproach of the cross. We must do our duty as the present day and opportunity are, and leave it to God to fulfil his promises in his own way and his own time. The grave of Jesus was appointed with the wicked, as was the case of those who suffered as criminals; but he was with the rich in his death, as prophesied, Isa 53:9; these two circumstances it was very unlikely should ever be united in the same person. He was buried in a new sepulchre; therefore it could not be said that it was not he, but some other that rose. We also are here taught not to be particular as to the place of our burial. He was buried in the sepulchre next at hand. Here is the Sun of Righteousness set for a while, to rise again in greater glory, and then to set no more.</body></html>
