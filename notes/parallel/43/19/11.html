Jesus says that he had of himself neither power of life nor power of death, that he had no power against Him but that which was given to him from above. By this is meant, of course, the power which was given to him by God, and the form in which it is expressed ("from above") has a special force in connection with the question of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-8.htm" title="When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;">John 19:8</a>, "Whence comest Thou?" That power of which he boasted existed only because He against whom he boasts submitted to it of His own will. "He that cometh from above is above all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>). But that power was given to him of God for the carrying out of the Messianic purposes which rendered the death of Jesus necessary. The position of Pilate was that of a half-conscious agent wielding this power. He indeed had sin, for he acted against his own better nature; but not the greater sin, for he did not act against the full light of truth.<p><span class= "bld">He that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</span>--This cannot mean Judas, who is nowhere mentioned in this connection, and is excluded by the words "unto thee." Judas delivered our Lord to the Jews. It was the Sanhedrin, and especially Caiaphas, the high priest, who, professing to represent God on earth, had delivered up the Son of God, and had declared that by the law He ought to die. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-49.htm" title="And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, You know nothing at all,">John 11:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-14.htm" title="Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.">John 18:14-28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wouldst not have</span> <span class="cmt_word">authority against me of any kind,</span> either judicial or actual, or both combined: thou wouldst hold no judicial position which I or others could recognize, nor wouldst thou have the faintest power to proceed against me unless, etc. Here our Lord points to the great doctrine which Paul afterwards expressed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>) about the powers that be, and hints that every circumstance and event which led to Pilate's occupancy of that judgment-seat, or which in recent times had delivered up the people of the Lord to the authority of Rome, and prepared for the occupancy of the Praetorium by Pontius Pilate himself, was altogether beyond the range of his judge's spontaneity and competency. <span class="cmt_word">Unless it were given thee from above</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). He does not say, "from my Father," or "from God" - phrases which would have been incomprehensible to a skeptical heathen; but "from above," from that Divine providential source of all power which rules all. The Lord thus implies the Divine legitimation of the judicial rank of Pilate; and the fact that his continuous occupancy of it was a talent revocable in a moment by the hand that gave it, and that all the exercise of his so-called <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> was dependent on his supreme will. <span class="cmt_word">For this cause he that delivered</span> <span class="cmt_word">me up to thee.</span> Though Judas is continually described as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-21.htm">John 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64-71</a>), yet we have already seen that the act of Judas had been endorsed by the people, and by the Sanhedrin, who now by their highest official representative had "delivered" him up to Pilate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-35.htm">John 18:35</a>, note), betrayed him with murderous intention to the power which could not merely excommunicate, but could kill by judicial process. Our Lord may either refer to Caiaphas (Bengel, Meyer, Luthardt) or to the Sanhedrin and people as a whole (Godet). <span class="cmt_word">Hath greater sin</span>. "Because the initiative has been taken by him, and irrespective of thee; because thy power, such as it is over me, is a Divine arrangement, made irrespective of thy will; and the whole of this proceeding has been forced upon thee against thy better judgment." Nevertheless, he implies that Pilate has sinned: he was exercising his seeming judicial rights irrespective of justice. He had declared Jesus to be free from blame or charge in open court, but he had nevertheless submitted the innocent Sufferer to the utmost wrong; but he that delivered Christ-to Pilate had done so out of willful ignorance, and was sinning against light and knowledge. Caiaphas might have recognized Christ's true Messiahship, and accepted his true claims, and bowed before him as the Sent of God, as the Son of the Blessed; but instead of this he had violated the law, and sacrificed the hope and spiritual independence of his own people, out of deference to the sacrosanct honors of his own order. Pilate's consciousness of independence is rebuked, and his conscience appealed to, and the Lord, in this last word to his judge, claims to be his Suzerain, and awards to him his share of blame. Pilate said to the Jews, "I find no fault in him;" Jesus said to Pilate, "Thou hast committed a great sin, though there is another God-given <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, which is more seriously and culpably trifled with than thine is: he that delivered me to thee hath committed a greater." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-18 Little did Pilate think with what holy regard these sufferings of Christ would, in after-ages, be thought upon and spoken of by the best and greatest of men. Our Lord Jesus came forth, willing to be exposed to their scorn. It is good for every one with faith, to behold Christ Jesus in his sufferings. Behold him, and love him; be still looking unto Jesus. Did their hatred sharpen their endeavours against him? and shall not our love for him quicken our endeavours for him and his kingdom? Pilate seems to have thought that Jesus might be some person above the common order. Even natural conscience makes men afraid of being found fighting against God. As our Lord suffered for the sins both of Jews and Gentiles, it was a special part of the counsel of Divine Wisdom, that the Jews should first purpose his death, and the Gentiles carry that purpose into effect. Had not Christ been thus rejected of men, we had been for ever rejected of God. Now was the Son of man delivered into the hands of wicked and unreasonable men. He was led forth for us, that we might escape. He was nailed to the cross, as a Sacrifice bound to the altar. The Scripture was fulfilled; he did not die at the altar among the sacrifices, but among criminals sacrificed to public justice. And now let us pause, and with faith look upon Jesus. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? See him bleeding, see him dying, see him and love him! love him, and live to him!</body></html>
