He can do nothing of Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-30.htm" title="I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.">John 5:30</a>), and does not even bear witness of Himself. If He did, it would be on technical grounds not to be credited. He meets the objection then doubtless in their minds, and soon expressed in their words. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-13.htm" title="The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true.">John 8:13-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - At this point the Lord proceeds to meet the clamour which most probably arose, the doubt and questioning which broke the silence with which his solemn defence had been received. We can hear between the lines the cries of an excited crowd, declaring that these words are simply his own. Such testimony as this to himself must be sustained and sanctioned. Why and how can this Teacher take such ground as to assert about himself what no prophet, no rabbi, no chief priest of the people, not even the greatest man of men, Moses himself, had ever dared to claim? Christ admits that such assumptions as these need justification and approval over and above his <span class="accented">ipse dixit.</span> The words that follow are startling: <span class="cmt_word">If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not true.</span> At first sight this is in direct contradiction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>, where, in reply to the Pharisees' "Thou bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is nor true," he replied, "<span class="accented">Though I bear witness of myself, my witness is true</span>; because I know whence I came, and whither I go." The absolute unison with the Father, which he was not only conscious of, but had also revealed to the Pharisees, lifted his own word to the grandeur of a word of God. The Divine beamed through the human, the infinite through the finite. Here he says, "<span class="accented">If I bear</span> - if I and I alone were bearing <span class="accented">witness</span> to myself," then - supposing a case, which, as a matter of fact, is impossible - "<span class="accented">my</span> <span class="accented">witness is not true."</span> If he were acting alone, which is an inconceivable supposition, seeing that in the depths of his consciousness he knew that he was one with the Father, then for his human nature to break away thus from the Father and disdain his testimony would nullify and falsify his witness. He is not bearing witness alone. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:30-38 Our Lord returns to his declaration of the entire agreement between the Father and the Son, and declared himself the Son of God. He had higher testimony than that of John; his works bore witness to all he had said. But the Divine word had no abiding-place in their hearts, as they refused to believe in Him whom the Father had sent, according to his ancient promises. The voice of God, accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost, thus made effectual to the conversion of sinners, still proclaims that this is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased. But when the hearts of men are full of pride, ambition, and the love of the world, there is no room for the word of God to abide in them.</body></html>
