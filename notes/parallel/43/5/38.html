If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1John 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1John 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1John 3:17</a>; and Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-36.htm" title="But I said to you, That you also have seen me, and believe not.">John 6:36</a>.) They had, indeed, the word of God, but they had it not as a power ever living in them. They locked it up with sacred care in ark and synagogue, but it found no home in their inmost life, and had no real power on their practice. They could take it up and put it down. It was something outside themselves. Had it been in them, it would have produced in them a moral consciousness, which would have accepted, as of the same nature with itself, every fuller revelation from God. Their own spirits, moulded by the word of God dwelling in them, would have received the Word of God now among them. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Excursus A: Doctrine of the Word.</span>) The fact that they believed not Him whom God <span class= "ital">sent</span> (not "hath sent") was itself the proof that they had not the abiding word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And further, you have not his Word</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x39f;&#x39d;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x39f;&#x393;&#x39f;&#x39d;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3a5;&#x3a4;&#x39f;&#x3a5;</span>) abiding in you. The Word of the Father (for the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> refers to the Father), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the full expression of the Father's heart, was sounding through the voice of the Son of God, and might have entered into and become an abiding power in their inmost conscience and their spiritual life; but they had not received the "Word" of the Lord through the "Voice" of the Lord. The reason given is, <span class="cmt_word">Because him whom he</span> (the Father) <span class="cmt_word">sent, him</span> (this One) <span class="cmt_word">ye believe not.</span> In other words, "Your lack of faith in me accounts for your perverse misconception, for your inability to see and hear all that there is of the Father's personal testimony to me." Some suspect a <span class="accented">petitio principii</span> in this argument, but the reasoning seems to be this; there is abundant evidence, corroboration, and cooperative glory, affirming the truth of all that Christ has said about himself as the Source of life and Judge of man; but the moral susceptibility of his hearers is paralyzed, and their faith in the most fundamental facts of their own experience is at fault. They seem impervious, not only to Christ's Word, but to the corroborative testimonies themselves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:30-38 Our Lord returns to his declaration of the entire agreement between the Father and the Son, and declared himself the Son of God. He had higher testimony than that of John; his works bore witness to all he had said. But the Divine word had no abiding-place in their hearts, as they refused to believe in Him whom the Father had sent, according to his ancient promises. The voice of God, accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost, thus made effectual to the conversion of sinners, still proclaims that this is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased. But when the hearts of men are full of pride, ambition, and the love of the world, there is no room for the word of God to abide in them.</body></html>
