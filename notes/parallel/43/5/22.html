To judge (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-29.htm" title="And shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.">John 5:29</a>) is the opposite of to quicken in the previous verse. The fact that the Son hath power to judge is correlative with His power to quicken whom He will. The spiritual life given to, and received by, some (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>), is a separation from, and a judgment of, others. The eternal life which shall be given to some, shall be the eternal separation from, and exclusion of, others. The reason why judgment is committed to the Son is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm" title="And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.">John 5:27</a> as resulting from His humanity. It is stated here as resulting from His divinity. It is that this power, like the quickening power of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a>, should lead all to give to the Son honour equal to that which they render to the Father. Again, this relation is urged against those who professed to honour God, and as a proof of it were seeking to kill His Son. That Sonship, expressing at once subordination and unity, necessarily involved the Fatherhood. To reject Him was to reject the Father who sent Him. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-30.htm" title="I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.">John 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36-37</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - That <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> is the point of connection with what follows, and that the Son quickeneth whom he willeth, is more clear, <span class="cmt_word">seeing that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the Father even judges no man</span>; judges no man apart from the Son. "Pater non judicat solus nec sine filio, judicat tamen (ver. 45; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a>)" (Bengel). The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> does not mean exclusively either "condemn" or "acquit," but the exercise of judicial functions which will either acquit or condemn. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, the "condemnation" is rather <span class="accented">inferred</span> than asserted. Moreover, we are there told that the Son was not sent into the world for the purpose of judgment, but for the larger purposes of salvation, and "to give eternal life." Nevertheless, "life" to some is judgment to others, and judgment even unto death is the obverse of the gift of life when the conditions of life are not found, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-39.htm">John 1:39</a> Christ declares that one solemn <span class="accented">consequence</span> of his coming was <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "unto judgment" - to reveal the final decisions of the Judge. How, then, shall we reconcile these apparently incongruous statements? Judgment unquestionably results from the rejection of the proffer of mercy. The judgment rests on those who say, "We see." Their sin remaineth. Those who are not willing to be made whole remain unhealed. Those who love darkness rather than light abide in the darkness. This is the judgment, but this judicial process was (not the end, but) the consequence of his mission. The Father's ordinary providence, which is always passing judgment upon the lives of men, is now placed in the hands of "the Son." <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit he hath given the whole judgment</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="cmt_word">the judgment in all its parts</span> - <span class="cmt_word">to the Son</span>. He has made the entire juridical process which brings to light the essential tendencies of human hearts, issue from the reception given by man to the Son. The whole question of right against wrong, of life <span class="accented">versus</span> death, acquittal against condemnation, is determined by the attitude of men towards the Son. In many passages this plenipotentiary endowment of "the Son" with functions, powers, authorities, is expressed by this same word (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>), "he hath given" (ver. 36; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-29.htm">John 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2, 4</a>). Meyer limits the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> to "condemnation," and Slier includes in it the separation of sin from the life of believers; but surely the judgment of the world is effected by the light that shines upon it, and the essence of the judgment (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is the discrimination which infailibly follows the revelation of the Father through the Son. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-23 The Divine power of the miracle proved Jesus to be the Son of God, and he declared that he worked with, and like unto his Father, as he saw good. These ancient enemies of Christ understood him, and became more violent, charging him not only with sabbath-breaking, but blasphemy, in calling God his own Father, and making himself equal with God. But all things now, and at the final judgment, are committed to the Son, purposely that all men might honour the Son, as they honour the Father; and every one who does not thus honour the Son, whatever he may think or pretend, does not honour the Father who sent him.</body></html>
