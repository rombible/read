The reader who will take the trouble to com pare these passages, will see clearly the difference in the Greek words. It should be <span class= "ital">lamp</span> in all these instances. The article in "<span class= "ital">the</span> lamp" is to be explained from a reference to the one lamp of every home. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-15.htm" title="Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all that are in the house.">Matthew 5:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-21.htm" title="And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?">Mark 4:21</a>.) The term was in common use to denote a distinguished hero or teacher. The Rabbis were often called "Lamps of the Law," and David was "The Lamp of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm" title="But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you quench not the light of Israel.">2Samuel 21:17</a>). Comp. the remarkable parallel spoken of the Baptist's great prototype, "Then stood up Elias the prophet, as fire, and his word was kindled like a lamp" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/48-1.htm" title="Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a lamp.">Ecclesiasticus 48:1</a>). Others explain the words here of the promised lamp which was to appear, or of the torchbearer who lights the bridegroom's path.<p><span class= "bld">Ye were willing . . .</span>--John's work came to them as light in darkness. It attracted them. They went to it. They were willing to find a source of joy in it. They sent to ask him questions, but they heeded not his answers. But the light came to them not to amuse them, but to lead them. He gave light because he had been kindled at the Source of all Light. He came to bear witness to them of the true Light, from which his was derived. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-23.htm" title="He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.">John 1:23</a>.) Their action with regard to John was part of the negatively evil, unreal character condemned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm" title="For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.">John 3:20</a>. They professed to be men, and teachers of other men; but when speaking of this John, our Lord found a similitude of their generation in the changing moods of little children playing in the market-place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-16.htm" title="But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,">Matthew 11:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was the lamp</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that burneth and shineth.</span> He was not the Light, but came to bear witness to the Light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8</a>). The glory of his appearance was a derived or kindled illumination (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>). (It is not against this inference that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a> the Lamb is the Lamp of the New Jerusalem.) The household lamp or torch, when kindled, burns with more or less brilliance, but burns itself out, exhausts itself. One may walk in the light of it, see the way one should take, discharge duties that would otherwise be impossible, avoid perils that might without the lamp prove disastrous or destructive; but the capacity of the torch is soon reduced to a minimum. Bengel, Stier, Alford, think that the celebrated passage in Ecclus. 48:1 may be referred to: "Then stood up Elijah the prophet like as a fire, and his word burned as a lamp." This is not impossible, though it would stand alone as a distinct reference in the Gospels to any apocryphal book. Lunge has given a long series of the lamp and fire symbols of the Old Testament; the group of events in which the Lord appeared in flames of fire and clouds of glory, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>, affirming John to be "the flame signal of Messiah, the last Old Testament form of the pillar of fire and candlestick of the temple, therefore the lamp at once flaming and shining." More than this, and more to the point, we find that, under the figure of lamps of fire, the messengers of God, the activities of the Church, here repeatedly set forth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). John was <span class="accented">the burning lamp</span>, not the archetypal Light. <span class="cmt_word">Ye desired for a season to rejoice in his light</span>. Many interpretations have been suggested, such as the exultation of a wedding party in the brief light of the torch bearer, announcing the approach of the bridegroom; or the dancing of ephemerides in the glitter of a lamp. The metaphor is lost in the solemn memory of the high gratification for a season which the populations of Judaea, Galilee, and the wilderness had manifested on the apparition of the great prophet. The universal acclaim soon subsided. The leaders of the people fell back when they heard John's call to repentance. Publicans and harlots pressed into the kingdom before the scribes and Pharisees. "The generation of vipers" did to John "whatsoever they listed." The secular power hushed his voice and crushed the man. "For a season" only did they listen to his word or respond to his challenge. His great testimony, though given to him by God, and by no means proceeding from his mere human consciousness, had been in the main unheeded. Wunsche quotes from 'Sota,' fol. 21, <span class="accented">a</span>, "Rabbi Menahem said that Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a>) compares 'prayer' with 'lamp,' and 'teaching' with 'light,' because the one flashes for the twinkling of an eye, comforts in the moment during which it shines; while the other, like the shining of the sun, burns evermore, and leads to eternal rest." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:30-38 Our Lord returns to his declaration of the entire agreement between the Father and the Son, and declared himself the Son of God. He had higher testimony than that of John; his works bore witness to all he had said. But the Divine word had no abiding-place in their hearts, as they refused to believe in Him whom the Father had sent, according to his ancient promises. The voice of God, accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost, thus made effectual to the conversion of sinners, still proclaims that this is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased. But when the hearts of men are full of pride, ambition, and the love of the world, there is no room for the word of God to abide in them.</body></html>
