The fundamental idea in the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> to render kindly and useful, even noble, service to another - to do the work and act the part of a <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>.

The misery believers are made whole from, warns us to sin no more, having felt the smart of sin. This is the voice of every providence, Go, and sin no more. Christ saw it necessary to give this caution; for it is common for people, when sick, to promise much; when newly recovered, to perform only something; but after awhile to forget all. Christ spoke of the wrath to come, which is beyond compare worse than the many hours, nay, weeks and years of pain, some wicked men have to suffer in consequence of their unlawful indulgences. And if such afflictions are severe, how dreadful will be the everlasting punishment of the wicked!</body></html>
