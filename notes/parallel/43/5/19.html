The Jews saw in this equality with God blasphemy, and sought to kill Him. Men have since seen and now see in it inferiority, and a proof that Christ did not claim for Himself the glory which the Apostle claims for Him in the prologue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1-18</a>), and which the Church has ever in reverent adoration placed as a crown upon His brow. The words "Son," "Father," are the answer to both. Did they accuse Him of blasphemy? He is a Son. The very essence of blasphemy was independence of, and rivalry with, God. He claimed no such position, but was as a Son subject to His Father's will, was as a Son <span class= "ital">morally</span> unable to do anything of Himself, and did whatever He saw the Father do. Yea, more. He thought not His equality with God a thing to be seized, but emptied Himself and became, as they then saw Him, in the form of a servant, and in the likeness of men. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-29.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">Christ vindicated his equality with the Father.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19, 20a.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">He declares himself to be</span> "<span class="accented">the Son</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore answered and said to them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> replied to their secret thoughts, and to the sentiments of animosity and hostility which they did not conceal. He spake in language of extraordinary solemnity and august claim. The <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily</span>, with which he prefaced the opening sentence, and which he repeated (cf. vers. 24, 25, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a> and elsewhere) on subsequent occasions, denoted the high ground of authoritative revelation on which he took his stand. He proceeded, without a break or interruption, to assert, on the authority of his own consciousness, the true relation subsisting between <span class="accented">the Son</span> and <span class="accented">the Father</span> - the deep, eternal, sacred link between them; in essence and in affection, in work and function; and gave several illustrations of these matters, the verification of which was not beyond the capacity of his hearers. These he made the basis of the argument of ver. 23, that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father." What did he wish "the Jews" to understand by "the Son"? Did he identify himself with the Son of whom he here speaks? Surely this is unquestionably the case, for the "answer" here given is one addressed to those who were seeking to slay him because he claimed for himself that God was "his own Father." He had said," My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." He justified the true reverence he felt for the Father when using this language, by describing in various ways the functions, privileges, and work of "the Son." Is "the Son," however, here the Eternal Son, the Logos, before and independently of his incarnation? and are the doctrines here announced an appeal to a pre-existing belief in such a sonship on the part of his enemies, so that he is dealing, at least from vers. 19-23, with the internal relations of the <span class="accented">Godhead</span>? The references to the recent <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and the moral effects which are to be produced upon his hearers by further activity, make this view doubtful. Does he here speak simply of "the Son of man" in his purely dependent, servile capacity, and earthly manifestation? (Watkins). We think not; for the deeds and functions of "the Son" are here so lofty and far reaching that this interpretation is inadmissible. Therefore we conclude, with Meyer and others, that by "the Son" he did mean "the whole subject, the God-Man, the incarnate Logos, in whom the self-determination of action independently of the Father cannot find place." This view of "the Son" involves the continuity of the Logos-consciousness, and not its obliteration; nor is this (as Reuss urges, and even Godet appears in part to concede) incompatible with the Logos-doctrine of the prologue. <span class="cmt_word">The Son is not able to do anything from himself,</span> in the great work of healing, life giving, and redemption, <span class="cmt_word">except that which he seeth the Father doing.</span> The Logos made flesh, the Son who has taken humanity up into his own eternal being, is ever in full contemplation of the Father's activity. He is in intimate and continuous and affectionate relations with the Father, who in this capacity has sent his Son to be the world's Saviour. He sees the Father's healing grace and omnipresent energy and ceaseless activity in regions where "the Jews" fail to discern them. The incarnate Son does not set up a rival throne or authority. He moves, lives, has his being, from the Father and not from himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-23 The Divine power of the miracle proved Jesus to be the Son of God, and he declared that he worked with, and like unto his Father, as he saw good. These ancient enemies of Christ understood him, and became more violent, charging him not only with sabbath-breaking, but blasphemy, in calling God his own Father, and making himself equal with God. But all things now, and at the final judgment, are committed to the Son, purposely that all men might honour the Son, as they honour the Father; and every one who does not thus honour the Son, whatever he may think or pretend, does not honour the Father who sent him.</body></html>
