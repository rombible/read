There is, perhaps, no Jewish feast with which it has not been identified, and it has been even proclaimed confidently that it must have been the Day of Atonement! (Caspari, <span class= "ital">Chron. and Geogr., Introd., Eng.</span> Trans., p. 130). Our reading is to be regarded as the better one, though not a few authorities insert the article, and interpret "<span class= "ital">the</span> Feast" to mean the Feast of Passover.<p>The time-limits are <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>, which was in Tebeth (January), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>, which bring us to the next Passover in Nisan (April), <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> an interval of four months, the year being an intercalary one with the month VeAdar (and Adar) added, or, as we should say, with two months of March. The only feast which falls in this interval is the Feast of Purim, and it is with this that the best modern opinion identifies the feast of our text. It was kept on the 14th of Adar (March), in commemoration of the deliverance of the Jews from the plots of Haman, and took its name from the lots cast by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-7.htm" title="In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.">Esther 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-24.htm" title="Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;">Esther 9:24</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It was one of the most popular feasts (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xi. 6, ? 13), and was characterised by festive rejoicings, presents, and gifts to the poor. At the same time it was not one of the great feasts, and while the writer names the Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a>), the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2</a>), and even that of the Dedication (John x 22), this has no further importance in the narrative than to account for the fact of Jesus being again in Jerusalem.

Suggesting a number of events, not necessarily connected with each other. (For the latter idea of a period expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a> and John 11:7, 11; for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a> and John 21:1. etc.) <span class="cmt_word">There was the feast of the Jews.</span> Now, "the feast" of the Jews could hardly be any other than the second <span class="accented">Passover</span>, while <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a> would indicate a third. "The feast" referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-45.htm">John 4:45</a> undoubtedly means the first Passover. "A feast" would leave the question open, though by no means excluding positively the second Passover, as the anarthrousness of the word might be chosen with a view to call special attention to it. However, the indefinite <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> has been identified by commentators with every feast in the calendar, so there can be no final settlement of the problem. If the feast be the Passover, then our Lord's ministry lasted a little more than three years. If not, it must be one or other of the feasts that elapsed between the Passovers of ch. 2 and ch. 6 Edersheim, with many others, refuses to accept any chronological hint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, and therefore throws the journey from Jerusalem to Galilee a few weeks after the first Passover, in the early summer, and supposes that Jesus returned to the unnamed feast in the autumn. Several critics say of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, one part of the sentence must be parabolical and the other literal, and that the disciples might be anticipating a spiritual harvest after four months, and Jesus drew from the physically ripening corn fields his comparison. This seems to me entirely contrary to our Lord's ordinary method; and that the disciples were in too carnal a mood to be credited with an anticipation of spiritual results in Samaria at all. Those who think that <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a> does give a hint of four months preceding harvest, place the journey between the middle of December and the middle of January. To my mind there is consequently no difficulty in imagining that when those four months should have been spent, and before the regular calling and appointment of the twelve apostles, our Lord should have gone up to the feast - one of the feasts which did summon the adult men to the metropolis. This is the view of Irenaeus, Luther, Cretins, Lampe, Neander, Hengstenberg, Conder, and many others. Wieseler, Hug, Meyer Lance, Godet, Weiss, Farrar, Watkins, think that the Feast of Purim, celebrated on the 15th of Adar (or March) (2 Macc. 15:36), in commemoration of the deliverance of the people from the evil intention of Haman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-21.htm">Esther 9:21</a>, etc.), was that national fast and feast which Jesus thus honoured. Purim was not one of the divinely appointed festivals, but it is also stated that the Lord undoubtedly attended one of the national and recently appointed festivals, that of Dedication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-22.htm">John 10:22</a>). The more serious objection is that it could, if desired, have been celebrated quite as well in Galilee as in Jerusalem, and that the method of celebration seemed contrary to the whole spirit of the Master, and the whole tone of the discourse which followed. It is said that part of the ritual of the feast was the free and frequent gifts made spontaneously by one to another. Westcott prefers the autumn Feast of Trumpets as more suitable on several grounds than the Passover, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because of the absence of the article, - this, however, is very problematical (see Tischendorf, 8th edit.); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because when at the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2</a>) the incident described in ch. 5 is still in lively recollection; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because the great events of the Feast of Trumpets, the commemoration of the Creation and the Law giving, correspond with the theme of the Lord's great discourse. The fact that this particular miracle on the sabbath should be referred to a few mouths later in Jerusalem, on Christ's third appearance there, is not improbable, if we bear in mind that Judaean emissaries in Galilee had been bitterly assailing Jesus, on the ground of his persistent determination to heal sickness and hopeless maladies on the sabbath day. This Jerusalem "sign," and the claim he made on the ground of it, had roused the cry, and was still the matter of contention. The claims of the Purim feast turn principally on the fact that, since it occurred, about a month before the Passover, on the 14th or 15th of Adar, this visit might have taken place in the course of the four months referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, and therefore between the sojourn in Samaria and the Passover of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>, which Jesus diet not attend. Dr. Moulton (assuming the anarthrous form of the <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>) thinks that the feast is left undetermined because there was nothing in it typical of our Lord's work, and fulfilled in his Person. Such a position renders the visit itself strange and apparently unealled for. These long gaps, silences, during which there is no record of event or discourse, constitute a leading feature of the gospel history, and indeed of most of the history of both Old and New Testaments. To my mind there is advantage rather than otherwise in supposing more time than a few months to have been consumed in the Galilaean ministry described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2.htm">Mark 2</a> and 3 Tregelles and the Revisers, with Westcott and Hort, have relegated the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1</a> to the margin, but; Tischendorf (8th edit.) and Canon Cooke, etc., retain the remarkable expression, on the overwhelming evidence of a host of authorities. If it stand, which we believe it must, then during the Galilaean ministry, and in the interval which preceded the Passover mentioned in ch. 6:4, there is a reference to the proximity of a previous Passover and a previous harvest; the Galilaean opposition to Christ on this question of ritual being at its very height. If so, the feast must have been the Passover. The question cannot be finally settled, and commentators are in hopeless conflict with one another. It must be admitted that the majority of modern critics assume the Feast of Purim to be that intended, and thereby reduce the length of our Lord's ministry from Cana to Calvary to two short years. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> This was before the formal call of the twelve apostles, and there is no proof that he was accompanied by his disciples. Many of the commentators (and see Weiss, 'Life of Christ,' vol. 2:321) urge that not even John himself was present on the occasion, from the absence of lifelike touches and particularity of incident. There is, however, much detail in the first fifteen verses. The great discourse that follows is not broken into dramatic dialogue, and does certainly present more of the biographer's subjective treatment than other portions of the narrative. It is more conceivable, however, that John did, on grounds mentioned by Caspari (see Introduction), accompany his Lord, and learned, by what he heard of these great words, and by subsequent converse with Jesus, the burden of the mighty revelation. Thoma sets to work in the most dogmatic way, and Weiss with a perfectly different spirit, to demonstrate the identity of the narrative which follows, with the famous story of the cure of the paralytic "borne of four" which occurs in the synoptic narrative. Thoma goes further, and imagines that the supposed healing of the paralytics by both Peter and Paul are also here idealized. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 We are all by nature impotent folk in spiritual things, blind, halt, and withered; but full provision is made for our cure, if we attend to it. An angel went down, and troubled the water; and what disease soever it was, this water cured it, but only he that first stepped in had benefit. This teaches us to be careful, that we let not a season slip which may never return. The man had lost the use of his limbs thirty-eight years. Shall we, who perhaps for many years have scarcely known what it has been to be a day sick, complain of one wearisome night, when many others, better than we, have scarcely known what it has been to be a day well? Christ singled this one out from the rest. Those long in affliction, may comfort themselves that God keeps account how long. Observe, this man speaks of the unkindness of those about him, without any peevish reflections. As we should be thankful, so we should be patient. Our Lord Jesus cures him, though he neither asked nor thought of it. Arise, and walk. God's command, Turn and live; Make ye a new heart; no more supposes power in us without the grace of God, his distinguishing grace, than this command supposed such power in the impotent man: it was by the power of Christ, and he must have all the glory. What a joyful surprise to the poor cripple, to find himself of a sudden so easy, so strong, so able to help himself! The proof of spiritual cure, is our rising and walking. Has Christ healed our spiritual diseases, let us go wherever he sends us, and take up whatever he lays upon us; and walk before him.</body></html>
