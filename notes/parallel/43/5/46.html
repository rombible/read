If they had really believed Moses, they would have seen in the whole spirit of the Pentateuch a manifestation of God, which would have led them to the fuller manifestation in Christ. Worship, and sacrifice, and offering, and priesthood, were all meant to teach. Their very name for "law" (<span class= "ital">Thorah</span>) meant "instruction." But they accepted what the senses could know, and never went down beneath this surface to its true significance--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> they never <span class= "ital">believed</span> Moses. We have here, in another form, the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39-40</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For he wrote of me.</span>--See the marginal references; but the thought is not to be confined to these passages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 46, 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me.</span> The reason for the previous saying is introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>. The form of the conditional sentence shows that the protasis is a supposition of an event contrary to the fact. They were <span class="accented">not believing</span> Moses, though they were putting a vain and illusive confidence in him; and hence they were not believing in Christ. Here is the secret of the antagonism to the Lord. A deeper understanding of their own Scripture would involve an acceptance of the claims of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">For he wrote of me</span>. The old saying contains Christ's utterance: <span class="accented">Novum Testamentum in Vetere latet, Vetus Testamentum in Novo patet.</span> Reference is made to the great place which Moses gave to the first promise, to the typical deliverances of a fallen world, to the hopes of a redeeming Seed. Christ referred to the Mosaic type involved in the spirit willing to sacrifice the Only Begotten, to the creation of the birthright blessing, the visions of the dying Israel, to the blessings on Judah; to the significance of the Law, of the tabernacle, of the Passover, of the Day of Atonement, of prophet, priest, and king, and the very special prophecy concerning a Prophet like unto himself. More than this, Moses had set forth in the Decalogue the portrait sketch of the perfect Man, of the Divine life which the Lord Jesus proceeded to fill out, to fulfil. He awakened by the Law that sense of sin and sinfulness which the Lord Christ had come to soothe and obliterate. but if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? "They are easier for you to understand; you have them ever on your tongue. If their meaning is missed, the deeper truths of my words will be more inaccessible to you." The antithesis is rather between the "his" and "my" than between the "writings" and "words." "This charge of not believing Moses, addressed to people who were put in a fury by the pretended violation of one of the Mosaic commandments, recalls other words of Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-29.htm">Matthew 23:29-32</a>), '<span class="accented">Ye build the tombs of the prophets, wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are children of them that killed the prophets</span>" (Godet). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:45-47 Many trust in some form of doctrines or some parties, who no more enter into the real meaning of those doctrines, or the views of the persons whose names they bear, than the Jews did into those of Moses. Let us search and pray over the Scriptures, as intent on finding eternal life; let us observe how Christ is the great subject of them, and daily apply to him for the life he bestows.</body></html>
