(Comp., <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-58.htm" title="And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.">Matthew 13:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-24.htm" title="And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help you my unbelief.">Mark 9:24</a>.) Men have often wondered at this. If faith is an expression in words or anything outside man, then there is room for wonder; but if it be a living principle, the "seeing Him who is invisible" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-27.htm" title="By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.">Hebrews 11:27</a>), then surely we may seek in vain for a more striking instance of its power than in this man; who in all, and through all, and in spite of all, trusted in, and looked for, the mercy of God, and had faith to be healed.<p>Jesus sees in him this receptive power, which in his very helplessness is strength, and calls it forth. He who could barely move is told to rise! he who had for eight-and-thirty years lain on his bed is to carry that bed and walk!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus smith to him, Rise, take up thy bed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) - thy mattress or pallet; the word is said to be of Macedonian origin, it is Latinized in the Vulgate into <span class="accented">grabbatus</span>, and is not unfrequently found in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-4.htm">Mark 2:4, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-55.htm">Mark 6:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-15.htm">Acts 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-33.htm">Acts 9:33</a>); the ordinary Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> - <span class="cmt_word">and walk.</span> These are in part the identical words which Jesus addressed to the paralytic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-9.htm">Mark 2:9</a>). He did not touch him or use any other means than his own life-giving word to confer the cure. He put forth, in royal might and spontaneous unsolicited exertion, the miraculous force. The energy of the Lord's will mastered the palsied will of the sick man, and infused into him the lacking energy. Archdeacon Watkins supposes that the man did possess incipient and recipient faith, moved by the generous tenderness and sympathetic interest of the Stranger in his ease. The very striking fact mentioned in the synoptic cure of the paralytic, viz. that he was borne into the presence of Jesus by four friends, ought to have prevented Thoma's caricature of criticism, which makes this narrative a mere idealization of that. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 We are all by nature impotent folk in spiritual things, blind, halt, and withered; but full provision is made for our cure, if we attend to it. An angel went down, and troubled the water; and what disease soever it was, this water cured it, but only he that first stepped in had benefit. This teaches us to be careful, that we let not a season slip which may never return. The man had lost the use of his limbs thirty-eight years. Shall we, who perhaps for many years have scarcely known what it has been to be a day sick, complain of one wearisome night, when many others, better than we, have scarcely known what it has been to be a day well? Christ singled this one out from the rest. Those long in affliction, may comfort themselves that God keeps account how long. Observe, this man speaks of the unkindness of those about him, without any peevish reflections. As we should be thankful, so we should be patient. Our Lord Jesus cures him, though he neither asked nor thought of it. Arise, and walk. God's command, Turn and live; Make ye a new heart; no more supposes power in us without the grace of God, his distinguishing grace, than this command supposed such power in the impotent man: it was by the power of Christ, and he must have all the glory. What a joyful surprise to the poor cripple, to find himself of a sudden so easy, so strong, so able to help himself! The proof of spiritual cure, is our rising and walking. Has Christ healed our spiritual diseases, let us go wherever he sends us, and take up whatever he lays upon us; and walk before him.</body></html>
