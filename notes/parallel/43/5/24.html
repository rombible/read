For "shall not come into condemnation," read <span class= "ital">doth not come into judgment.</span> (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-18.htm" title="He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.">John 3:18</a>.)<p>The repeated "verily" introduces, as elsewhere, one of the deeper spiritual truths which He came to teach. This truth explains the "whom He willeth" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a> to have no limit but that of human receptivity. It again brings out the unity of Father and Son. The Son's word is the revelation of the Father. He that hears this word believes not on Him only, but on Him that sent Him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-44.htm" title="Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.">John 12:44</a>). It asserts that eternal life is not of the future only, but is already in germ possessed by the man who is thus brought into communion with the source of life. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1John 1:2</a>.) This man comes not into judgment. There can be for him no separation from God, no condemnation. He has already passed from the state of death to that of life. What remains for him is the development of life.<p><span class= "bld">Believeth on him</span> <span class= "bld">that sent me.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">believeth Him that sent Me.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - In this verse the discourse turns from the relations between the Father and the Son, to deal with the relations of the living Christ (the "I," who is speaking throughout) with men. In vers. 21-23, indeed Vers. 19-23, the Lord had been speaking prominently of the ideal sonship, of "the Son" on the Divine side of his consciousness. The use of the first person, which is here resumed, calls more express attention to the consciousness of his human manifestation, which again reaches its climax in ver. 27. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you -</span> I, whose voice you now hear, whom you are misunderstanding, rejecting, and seeking to slay. <span class="accented">I say</span> with most solemn emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">He that heareth my word</span> - this term, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, suggests moral as well as physical hearing, and means whosoever allows my thought to penetrate his nature, hears and understands, hears and acts accordingly (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a><span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> 5; 13:9, 18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-22.htm">Revelation 3:22</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="accented">further <span class="cmt_word"></span>believeth him that sent me;</span> believeth <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that he has borne and is continually bearing true witness concerning me. There is a different meaning conveyed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, with the simple dative, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, and again <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>; these prepositions convey a gradually deepening sense of intercommnnion and dependence; the simple accusative is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>; Ellicott on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>). To believe on a person, or in one, conveys a different idea from believing that person with regard to any special assertion he may make. Here the belief of God has emphatic reference to the testimony the Father is bearing to the claims of Jesus. Such a hearer, such a believer, <span class="cmt_word">hath eternal life</span>; even here he has entered into the "eternal now;" on earth he is in possession of the blessed consummation. Such belief in words authenticated by the Father's commission is eternal life (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). It lifts a man out of the reach of corruption and condemnation, it ushers him into eternity, it is an eternal blessedness in itself; <span class="cmt_word">and he cometh not to judgment, but has passed from the death, into the life.</span> He is already translated from the death state to the renewed, quickened state. The decision and discrimination between him and the world have taken place. The judgment is over, the books are closed, the condemnation is no longer possible. He will not perish, he has eternal life. "The believer is tree from the judgment which executes itself in the exclusion inflicted on the unbeliever, by the revelation of Jesus as the Light, because he is already in possession of the saving blessing" (Luthardt). Judgment, being completed, does not require repetition" (Godet). "When that confidence in Christ has illumined the heart wherein we recognize that we have been verily accepted, listened to, ruled, and defended by God, peace follows, and high joyfulness, which is the realization of eternal life, and which covers the sins that erewhile had clung to our weakness" (Melancthon). In this life of faith "we taste the powers of the world to come," "our citizenship is in heaven." "This eternal life is a veritable resurrection of the dead" (Augustine). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:24-29 Our Lord declared his authority and character, as the Messiah. The time was come when the dead should hear his voice, as the Son of God, and live. Our Lord first refers to his raising those who were dead in sin, to newness of life, by the power of the Spirit, and then to his raising the dead in their graves. The office of Judge of all men, can only be exercised by one who has all knowledge, and almighty power. May we believe His testimony; thus our faith and hope will be in God, and we shall not come into condemnation. And may His voice reach the hearts of those dead in sin; that they may do works meet for repentance, and prepare for the solemn day.</body></html>
