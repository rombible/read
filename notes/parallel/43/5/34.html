The substantive, and verbs from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-31.htm" title="If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.">John 5:31</a>, have been rendered by "witness," and it is better to keep it here. The English also fails to give the article, and is therefore misleading. He did receive witness from men--had received witness from John--but this was not <span class= "ital">the witness</span> upon which all was based. Its purpose was to lead them to Christ Himself, and He now refers to it, to show them its true position, that that purpose might be fulfilled.<p><span class= "bld">But these things I say, that ye might be saved.</span>--The emphasis of the clause should be placed upon the pronoun "ye." The thought is, that our Lord does not refer to John's witness for His own sake, but in order that they might be saved. He had a greater witness than that of John, but this they were not yet prepared to receive. They had received John for a season, and had rejoiced in his light. He refers to him now that that light may lead them to the true Source of Light. Some of those who had sent to the Baptist may now understand his words in a deeper sense than any which had come to them before, and may find in them words leading to salvation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I for my part receive not the witness</span> which affirms my Sonship <span class="cmt_word">from a man</span>; or, <span class="accented">yet the witness which I receive is not from man.</span> Some have given the stronger meaning of "take hold," or "snatch," or "strive after," to <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>. But this is unnecessary, for emphasis is laid on the article, "the witness," which is real, infallible, convincing, commanding, must come from the highest source of all. Yet, though Christ cannot depend upon John's testimony, it ought to have had weight with his hearers. It called them to repentance, to holy living, to faith in the Coming One. It discounted their pride in Abrahamic birth, and their false notions of race purity; it made personal and individual that which had been looked at as a national monopoly of privilege. Nay, more, it had testified that he was the "Lamb of God" and the "Son of God" and the "Bridegroom of the Church." Therefore he continued: <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit, these things I say -</span> I call attention to the sum total of his message, the testimony he bore to truth - <span class="cmt_word">that ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">may be saved;</span> for all that John said was true. "John did no miracle: but all things that he said concerning Jesus were true" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-41.htm">John 10:41</a>; see notes). If the Jews had accepted the testimony of John, they wound not now be cherishing angry and rebellious thought, and have been so blinded to the truth and reality of things. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:30-38 Our Lord returns to his declaration of the entire agreement between the Father and the Son, and declared himself the Son of God. He had higher testimony than that of John; his works bore witness to all he had said. But the Divine word had no abiding-place in their hearts, as they refused to believe in Him whom the Father had sent, according to his ancient promises. The voice of God, accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost, thus made effectual to the conversion of sinners, still proclaims that this is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased. But when the hearts of men are full of pride, ambition, and the love of the world, there is no room for the word of God to abide in them.</body></html>
