Jesus continues to dwell, in the remainder of the discourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-41.htm" title="I receive not honor from men.">John 5:41-47</a>), on the true cause of their incredulity. "Ye will not come to Me," is the central thought. But were they, then, to follow this young Teacher, while they themselves had schools and disciples who held their teaching sacred, and their persons in honour, and addressed them as "Rabbi?" No! this is not the true coming to Him. They seek glory from men. He does not receive it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-34.htm" title="But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.">John 5:34</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41-47.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> <span class="accented">The effect of the revelation of the Son upon the Jews.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41, 42.</span> - This appeal to the will of man was apparently entirely misunderstood, and ended for the time in failure. "They would not come." Everything was prepared, but none were ready or willing to accept even so rich a blessing as life itself. This is the refrain of the whole Bible: "Ye will not; .... Ye would not;" "What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?" "I called, and ye refused;" "I wrote the great things of my Law; ye have counted them as strange things." Our Lord proceeds in the closing words to account in some respects for this unwillingness. <span class="cmt_word">I receive not glory from men, but I know you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, I have come by experience or intuition to such knowledge of you), <span class="cmt_word">that you have not the love of God in you</span>. The love of God is the principle of all obedience; and Christ elsewhere declares it to be the first and great commandment of the Law. But love is the principle of all knowledge. "He that loveth not knoweth not." This principle reaches its fullest expression when we learn the greater truth that "God is love." It is true of all objects of love, the highest kind of knowledge is not possible without love. This is pre-eminently the case when we think of knowing God. Since God is essential Love, without experiencing love we cannot realize that Divine essence. Again, there is an elementary faith that precedes elementary love, but when love is once awakened, faith again deepens, and love grows by what it feeds upon, until the faith becomes vision and the love rapture. But why the opening words, <span class="accented">I receive not glory from men</span>? Probably they intimate opposition and questioning to some such effect as this: "Thou hast declared thyself the Giver of life and resurrection, and charged our lack of spiritual life upon our unwillingness to believe these claims and to submit ourselves to these exalted assumptions or to go to thee for life. Thou art eager, after all, for our approval and glory." To this Christ replied, "<span class="accented">Glory from men I receive not.</span> It is not for my sake, but for yours, I say, 'Come unto me and live;' but, alas! having searched you through and through, I discern no love, none of the spirit out of which the forces of faith can be evolved. The reason why you are unwilling to come to me for life is that you are measuring me by yourselves, and have not that self-emptying and abnegation and distrust out of which faith and love, love and faith, must ever spring." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:39-44 The Jews considered that eternal life was revealed to them in their Scriptures, and that they had it, because they had the word of God in their hands. Jesus urged them to search those Scriptures with more diligence and attention. Ye do search the Scriptures, and ye do well to do so. They did indeed search the Scriptures, but it was with a view to their own glory. It is possible for men to be very studious in the letter of the Scriptures, yet to be strangers to its power. Or, Search the Scriptures, and so it was spoken to them in the nature of an appeal. Ye profess to receive and believe the Scripture, let that be the judge. It is spoken to us as advising or commanding all Christians to search the Scriptures. Not only read them, and hear them, but search them; which denotes diligence in examining and studying them. We must search the Scriptures for heaven as our great end; For in them ye think ye have eternal life. We must search the Scriptures for Christ, as the new and living Way, that leads to this end. To this testimony Christ adds reproofs of their unbelief and wickedness; their neglect of him and his doctrine. Also he reproves their want of the love of God. But there is life with Jesus Christ for poor souls. Many who make a great profession of religion, yet show they want the love of God, by their neglect of Christ and contempt of his commandments. It is the love of God in us, the love that is a living, active principle in the heart, which God will accept. They slighted and undervalued Christ, because they admired and overvalued themselves. How can those believe, who make the praise and applause of men their idol! When Christ and his followers are men wondered at, how can those believe, the utmost of whose ambition is to make a fair show in the flesh!</body></html>
