It is as follows, <span class="cmt_word">in order that all may honour the Son.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("honour," not "worship"), is the word used; but seeing that the identical sentiment of reverence due to the Supreme Being, to the Father, is that which is here said to be due to the Son, and is here declared to be the reason why all judgment is entrusted to the issues of his will, - we are at a loss to know how loftier attributes could be ascribed to the Son. It is surprising that Weiss should declare it "impossible to find any statements here as to the metaphysical unity and equality of the Son and the Father, although current apologetics believe it has succeeded in doing so" ('Life of Christ,' vol. 2:326, note). Luthardt asks, "What other form of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> than that which calls him 'Lord and God' shall belief now assume, than that which the Christian Church cherishes toward Jesus?" Thoma points to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13</a>, and other great parallels in the New Testament. We gladly accept them, not as proof that the Johannist framed Christ's discourse from them, but as proof that the ideas of St. Paul were not originated by him. but came from the direct assertions of Christ, of which we have the historic trace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:17-23 The Divine power of the miracle proved Jesus to be the Son of God, and he declared that he worked with, and like unto his Father, as he saw good. These ancient enemies of Christ understood him, and became more violent, charging him not only with sabbath-breaking, but blasphemy, in calling God his own Father, and making himself equal with God. But all things now, and at the final judgment, are committed to the Son, purposely that all men might honour the Son, as they honour the Father; and every one who does not thus honour the Son, whatever he may think or pretend, does not honour the Father who sent him.</body></html>
