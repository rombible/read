The voice of God is always most quickly heard by the hearts that love Him; the presence of God is never so truly felt as in the utter helplessness of human woe.<p><span class= "bld">Saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</span>--The better reading is, <span class= "ital">saith unto Him in Hebrew, Rabboni . . .--</span>Comp.

She had heard in the well-known voice her own name, and it has brought back to her all the old associations. It is the "Master," or, as the Hebrew word means, <span class= "ital">"My</span> Master," and she falls at His feet to embrace Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith unto her, Mary</span>. The more general expression, "woman" (ver. 15), makes her seem to us the representative of the whole of suffering humanity, weeping over the inability to find any link of fellowship between itself and the invisible God, feeling unconsciously after the Christ and haply not finding him, weeping because hostility had obliterated him or superstition had concealed him, while all the while he is near at hand. But now Jesus stirred the affection of the living, weeping person at his side by uttering her own name in tones that thrilled her to the heart, and created the new sublime conviction that he had risen, as he said. She turned herself, as though the previous glance had been momentary and partial, and now the vision and voice blended, and she knew him. <span class="cmt_word">And saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabbouni</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is here introduced by modern editors, This word only occurs in this Gospel and the Apocalypse), <span class="cmt_word">a word</span> (the evangelist adds) <span class="cmt_word">which is to say, Master</span>. The Hebrew term - probably preserved in its Galilaean form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, rabbouni, rather than in the ordinary form (see Authorized Version) <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, rabboni - if strictly translated, would be "my Teacher," or "my Master," yet the personal pronoun must not be pressed. It doubtless had lost its specialty as we find in many other languages (monsieur, mein herr, "my Lord," are familiar instances). Even if the full force of the pronoun were urged, Mary's faith had not gone beyond the ideal of her devotedly loved Teacher, Friend, Master, and fell far short of the insight which even the incredulous Thomas would soon exhibit, that the Lord had put on Divine glory, and filled all things. She apparently fell in speechless, passionate affection at his feet, as the other women did shortly afterwards (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9</a>); but with the idea that now the old relations between Teacher and loving disciples would be resumed. She was in no mood answering to the doubtfulness of the disciples who desired proof of his identity, of the fact of his corporeity, before they could understand his claim to be their perpetual Guide, and his promise to be with them "unto the end of the world;" but she thought at once of the old life in Galilee. Her joy knew no bounds, but her conception of the reality of that which was revealed to her was most imperfect. It was the realization of love rather than the perception of intellect. She rushed hastily to a very limited conclusion; and she suffered an obvious correction, if not repulse, which has been interpreted in many ways. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:11-18 We are likely to seek and find, when we seek with affection, and seek in tears. But many believers complain of the clouds and darkness they are under, which are methods of grace for humbling their souls, mortifying their sins, and endearing Christ to them. A sight of angels and their smiles, will not suffice, without a sight of Jesus, and God's smiles in him. None know, but those who have tasted it, the sorrows of a deserted soul, which has had comfortable evidences of the love of God in Christ, and hopes of heaven, but has now lost them, and walks in darkness; such a wounded spirit who can bear? Christ, in manifesting himself to those that seek him, often outdoes their expectations. See how Mary's heart was in earnest to find Jesus. Christ's way of making himself known to his people is by his word; his word applied to their souls, speaking to them in particular. It might be read, Is it my Master? See with what pleasure those who love Jesus speak of his authority over them. He forbids her to expect that his bodily presence look further, than the present state of things. Observe the relation to God, from union with Christ. We, partaking of a Divine nature, Christ's Father is our Father; and he, partaking of the human nature, our God is his God. Christ's ascension into heaven, there to plead for us, is likewise an unspeakable comfort. Let them not think this earth is to be their home and rest; their eye and aim, and earnest desires, must be upon another world, and this ever upon their hearts, I ascend, therefore I must seek the things which are above. And let those who know the word of Christ, endeavour that others should get good from their knowledge.</body></html>
