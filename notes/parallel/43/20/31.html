His object is that those for whom he writes may become believers, and read in these signs the spiritual truths which lay behind them. He has traced step by step the developments of faith in the Apostles themselves, and this has reached its highest stage in the confession of Thomas. He has recorded the blessedness of those who shall believe without sight, uttered in his Master's words. In the confession of Thomas, and in the comment of our Lord, the object of the author finds its full expression, and with their words the Gospel finds its fitting close. "Become not faithless, but believing;" "My Lord and my God;" "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed"--these are the words the author heard and records. "But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God." This is the object he had in recording them. On the special meaning of these words as connected with the Gnostic heresies of the time, comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 378.<p><span class= "bld">And that believing ye might have life through his name.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">in His name.</span> Thus the last words bring us back again to the first. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>, says he, <span class="cmt_word">these are written</span> with a special purpose. The author did not intend to write a full history or a detailed biography; he avowed having made a unique and well-considered selection of "signs," which formed the theme of great discourse, of "words" which revealed the inner depths of that wondrous nature, and which, far from exhausting the theme, only touched its fringes; and he did this with a distinct aim, <span class="cmt_word">in order that ye</span> (he here addresses the Churches already founded and waiting for his legacy) <span class="cmt_word">might believe</span>. Believe what? Simply in the fact of the Resurrection? Certainly not; but <span class="cmt_word">that Jesus</span>, the Man whose life has been enacted on this human stage, <span class="cmt_word">is the Christ</span>, has fulfilled the entire idea of the Messiah and is now the realization of the grandest theocratic hope; and further, that he is the" Christ," because he is none other than the <span class="cmt_word">Son of God,</span> the Revelation of the Divine nature, the Image of the Father's substance, the Effluence of his glory, seeing that his is the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father. Nor is this all. He adds, <span class="cmt_word">And that believing</span> in this glory, in this reality, in this Christhood, in this Sonship, <span class="cmt_word">ye might have life</span>, the blessedness of true being, the sacred fellowship with the Eternal, the hold upon FOREVER, the sanctity of "the life" that is "light," the everlasting life of the sons of God. The prologue here finds its true and efficient complement. The purpose now betrayed expounds the structure of the Gospel as a whole. The apostle claims kinship with the central apostolate. The Hebrew prophet does not disdain his true kindred. The evangelist does not disclaim his predecessors. The lover of souls discloses his lofty passion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:30,31 There were other signs and proofs of our Lord's resurrection, but these were committed to writing, that all might believe that Jesus was the promised Messiah, the Saviour of sinners, and the Son of God; that, by this faith, they might obtain eternal life, by his mercy, truth, and power. May we believe that Jesus is the Christ, and believing may we have life through his name.</body></html>
