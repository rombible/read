The words "looking in" rightly complete the meaning. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-38.htm" title="Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay on it.">John 11:38</a>, and for the word, Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm" title="Then arose Peter, and ran to the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.">Luke 24:12</a>.) It is used again in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-11.htm" title="But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,">John 20:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm" title="But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.">James 1:25</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>. It meant, originally, to stoop sideways, and was used, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> of a harp-player; then, to stoop over, peer into, inquire into. For the "linen clothes," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-40.htm" title="Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.">John 19:40</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Yet went he not in.</span>--He is restrained by wonder, not unaccompanied, perhaps, by fear, at what he sees, and waits for his friend and companion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And having stooped down</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> is the verb used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a> to describe Peter's conduct and gesture. It was a necessary preliminary of the subsequent act of Peter, though Luke does not refer to it. Peter himself uses the same word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). It means literally "bending on one side," with a desire to gaze intently on an object (Ecclus. 14:23 Ecclus. 21:23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He seeth the linen clothes lying</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-40.htm">John 19:40</a>), untenanted and unused, those very cerecloths which he had helped to wind round the sacred, wounded body, with their affluence of sweet spices. <span class="cmt_word">Yet entered he not within</span>. Awe, reverence, mystery, fear, nascent hope, the thought most possibly, "Not here, but risen," began to dawn faintly on his mind. There was ringing in his ears," Your sorrow shall be turned into joy." The touch of the eye-witness, and the personal part of one who is describing his own activity. Weft-stein, on <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, adds, "no pollueretur," and quotes numerous Talmudieal authorities to show how the corpse and the grave and gravestone would pollute the living (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>). If so, then Peter, before he came to the conclusion that there was no death in the sepulcher, broke a ritual law which John respected. There seems also rabbinical authority for the fact that disciples might carry "the just" to their grave without such tear of pollution. But at this moment they were both lifted above the region of ritual altogether. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-10 If Christ gave his life a ransom, and had not taken it again, it would not have appeared that his giving it was accepted as satisfaction. It was a great trial to Mary, that the body was gone. Weak believers often make that the matter of complaint, which is really just ground of hope, and matter of joy. It is well when those more honoured than others with the privileges of disciples, are more active than others in the duty of disciples; more willing to take pains, and run hazards, in a good work. We must do our best, and neither envy those who can do better, nor despise those who do as well as they can, though they come behind. The disciple whom Jesus loved in a special manner, and who therefore in a special manner loved Jesus, was foremost. The love of Christ will make us to abound in every duty more than any thing else. He that was behind was Peter, who had denied Christ. A sense of guilt hinders us in the service of God. As yet the disciples knew not the Scripture; they Christ must rise again from the dead.</body></html>
