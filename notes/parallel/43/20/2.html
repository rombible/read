This certainly may be so, but we cannot say more than this. It certainly may be that, in her feeling of despair, she speaks generally of the utter hopelessness of human effort, whether her own or that of others. It is the passionate cry of her woman's heart. They have not only crucified the Lord, but have robbed the body of the resting-place which love had provided for it, and of the tender care with which love was seeking to surround it--"They have taken away the Lord; and we know not to what fresh indignity their hatred, against which even the grave is not proof, has subjected the body of Him whom we have loved. We know not where they have laid Him."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then she runneth</span> in advance of the other women, who are each intent on communicating what she had seen and heard, <span class="cmt_word">and cometh to Simon Peter</span> - why not, if, as Mark says, Peter had been specially mentioned by the angel? - <span class="cmt_word">and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved</span>. The form of the expression suggests that they were living in different houses. [There were two disciples on whom Jesus poured out the abundance of his love. The word here used is not <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>, that which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-23.htm">John 13:23</a> and John 21:7-20, and which denotes the love of high regard, but <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, the love of personal affection, the kind of love showered on Lazarus and his sisters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-5.htm">John 11:5</a>). So far, then, from John especially exalting himself at the expense of Peter, he gives to Peter the first place in the affection of his Master.] <span class="cmt_word">And she saith to them, They have taken away the Lord</span> - even the corpse of Jesus was the Lord to this urgent and impassioned disciple - <span class="cmt_word">out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they</span> - Joseph and Nicodemus, or the chief priests, or Roman soldiers, or Jews - <span class="cmt_word">have laid him</span>. We know not what other burying-place "they" have chosen! The anti-harmonistic commentators, with ponderous literalism, insist that Mary could have said nothing more. A gushing woman like Mary of Magdala uttered one sentence, and that was all: It is, however, entirely evident that she must have said enough to excite great wonderment, haste, and activity in the breasts of these two disciples (see above on the three hypotheses). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-10 If Christ gave his life a ransom, and had not taken it again, it would not have appeared that his giving it was accepted as satisfaction. It was a great trial to Mary, that the body was gone. Weak believers often make that the matter of complaint, which is really just ground of hope, and matter of joy. It is well when those more honoured than others with the privileges of disciples, are more active than others in the duty of disciples; more willing to take pains, and run hazards, in a good work. We must do our best, and neither envy those who can do better, nor despise those who do as well as they can, though they come behind. The disciple whom Jesus loved in a special manner, and who therefore in a special manner loved Jesus, was foremost. The love of Christ will make us to abound in every duty more than any thing else. He that was behind was Peter, who had denied Christ. A sense of guilt hinders us in the service of God. As yet the disciples knew not the Scripture; they Christ must rise again from the dead.</body></html>
