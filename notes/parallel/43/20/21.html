He is now about to withdraw the evidence of His presence from them, and does so with the customary "<span class= "ital">Shal?m;</span>" but with this He reminds them of the apostleship to which He has called them, gives them an earnest of the Presence which will never leave them, but always qualify them for it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-22.htm" title="And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:">John 20:22</a>), and places before them the greatness of the work to which He sends them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-23.htm" title="Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.">John 20:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As my </span>(better, <span class= "ital">the</span>) <span class= "bld">Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</span>--Comp.

He and they stand also in the same relation to the world. At this very moment they are assembled with shut doors, for fear of the Jews, who are triumphing over Him as dead. But to that world, which will hate, persecute, and kill them, as it had hated, persecuted, and killed Him, they are sent as He was sent; they are to declare forgiveness, mercy, love, peace, as He had declared them, to every heart that does not harden itself against them; and they are to find in His presence, as He had ever found in the Father's presence, the support which will ever bring peace to their own hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you.

St. John uses to describe this act of the risen Lord the striking word which had been used to describe the act by which God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life. He writes as one who remembered how the influence of that moment on their future lives was a new spiritual creation, by which they were called, as it were, out of death into life. It was the first step in that great moral change which passed over the disciples after the Crucifixion, and of which the day of Pentecost witnessed the accomplishment.<p><span class= "bld">And saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.</span>--These words are not, on the one hand, to be understood as simply a promise of the future gift of the Holy Ghost, for they are a definite imperative, referring to the moment when they were spoken; nor are they, on the other hand, to be taken as the promised advent of the Paraclete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> for the gift of the Holy Ghost was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The meaning is that He then gave to them a sign, which was itself to faithful hearts as the firstfruits of that which was to come. His act was sacramental, and with the outer and visible sign there was the inward and spiritual grace. The very word used was that used when He said to them, "Take (<span class= "ital">receive ye</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> eat; this is My body" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-26.htm" title="And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.">Matthew 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-22.htm" title="And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.">Mark 14:22</a>). It would come to them now with a fulness of sacred meaning. The Risen Body is present with them. The constant spiritual Presence in the person of the Paraclete is promised to them. They again hear the words "Receive ye," and the very command implies the power to obey. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Excursus C: The Sacramental Teaching of St. John's Gospel,</span> p. 556.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Peace, spiration of the Holy Spirit, and conference of power to remit or retain sin. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore [Jesus</span><span class="cmt_word">] said unto them again, Peace be unto you.</span> With added emphasis, and in obvious reference to his valedictory discourse, he gave to them the essence of his own sublime repose, the blending of an infinite joy with a measureless sorrow; the equilibrium that springs from the spirit mastering the flesh. Not an ecstatic rapture, nor a joy that would make their life on earth insupportable by its contrast with their abiding frame of mind; but peace - "the peace of God, which passeth understanding." The first "peace" gave to all who were assembled a new revelation; the second "peace," a summons to service. The Lord added the memorable words, <span class="cmt_word">As the Father hath sent me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, hath sent me on a special commission), <span class="cmt_word">I also send you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>, charge you to go forth and accomplish this commission of mine); see Westcott's excursus on the New Testament usage of the two verbs, which does much to justify these shades of meaning. Both verbs are used of both the mission of the Son and the mission of believers, but in the two senses, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that sometimes the special service on which he or they are sent is emphasized by the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that at other times the simple mission or sending forth is the dominant idea when <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is employed. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-38.htm">John 4:38</a> the Lord says, "I sent (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) you to reap that on which ye bestowed no labor;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-18.htm">John 17:18</a> (see note) the same word is appropriately used twice - for the Lord's own commission, and also for the commission of the disciples. Then it seems to point back to an event in their history and the work done already and before Christ's death for the world. Now the disciples have a new conception of Christ and of his work, and they must go forth to fulfill it. This usage of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is more or less conspicuous in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-28.htm">John 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is used often to describe the Father's mission of the Son, the mission of the Comforter, and the mission of the disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>). Moulton says, " <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> means 'commission' and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;</span> 'mission.' With the first word our thoughts turn to the 'special embassy;' with the second, to the authority of the ' ambassador' and the obedience of the sent." Another peculiarity of this passage is that the Lord uses the perfect tense, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, rather than the aorist used elsewhere, suggesting a complete commission on his own side, whose meaning and effects are still in operation. Those who have received this revelation are to become at once witnesses to the fact of his resurrection, agents and organs of his Spirit. Moulton suggests that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is used in order to enforce the physical separation between the Lord and his disciples; and that we cannot overlook in the similarity of the ideas the difference in the manner of the sending, by the Savior of the disciples, from the manner in which the Son had been sent by the Father. Christ came forth from the eternal companionship of the Father, in the fact of his incarnation, taking humanity up into his eternal substance. The disciples were sent forth by the risen Lord, who had called them by grace into fellowship with himself, and who equipped them for his service. The difference in these two methods of sending is as conspicuous as the resemblance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:19-25 This was the first day of the week, and this day is afterwards often mentioned by the sacred writers; for it was evidently set apart as the Christian sabbath, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. The disciples had shut the doors for fear of the Jews; and when they had no such expectation, Jesus himself came and stood in the midst of them, having miraculously, though silently, opened the doors. It is a comfort to Christ's disciples, when their assemblies can only be held in private, that no doors can shut out Christ's presence. When He manifests his love to believers by the comforts of his Spirit, he assures them that because he lives, they shall live also. A sight of Christ will gladden the heart of a disciple at any time; and the more we see of Jesus, the more we shall rejoice. He said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost, thus showing that their spiritual life, as well as all their ability for their work, would be derived from him, and depended upon him. Every word of Christ which is received in the heart by faith, comes accompanied by this Divine breathing; and without this there is neither light nor life. Nothing is seen, known, discerned, or felt of God, but through this. After this, Christ directed the apostles to declare the only method by which sin would be forgiven. This power did not exist at all in the apostles as a power to give judgment, but only as a power to declare the character of those whom God would accept or reject in the day of judgment. They have clearly laid down the marks whereby a child of God may be discerned and be distinguished from a false professor; and according to what they have declared shall every case be decided in the day of judgment. When we assemble in Christ's name, especially on his holy day, he will meet with us, and speak peace to us. The disciples of Christ should endeavour to build up one another in their most holy faith, both by repeating what they have heard to those that were absent, and by making known what they have experienced. Thomas limited the Holy One of Israel, when he would be convinced by his own method or not at all. He might justly have been left in his unbelief, after rejecting such abundant proofs. The fears and sorrows of the disciples are often lengthened, to punish their negligence.</body></html>
