Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>.) We must understand the "signs" not of the proofs of the Resurrection only, but of the works wrought during the whole life. The writer's narrative is drawing to a close, and he explains the fact that he has recorded so little of a life which contained so much. There were, indeed, many other signs which he, as an eye-witness, remembered, but which it was not within his purpose to relate.<p>That he refers to the whole work of Christ, and not to the Risen Life only, is clear, because (1) there were not "many other signs" during the forty days; (2) the words "did Jesus" are not applicable to the manifestation to the disciples; (3) the words <span class= "ital">"</span>in this book" refer to all that has preceded.<p>It would seem to follow from this that these verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:">John 20:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-31.htm" title="But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.">John 20:31</a>) are the conclusion of the original Gospel, and that John 21 is to be regarded as a postscript or appendix. We shall find reason for believing that, though an appendix, it proceeded from the hand of the Apostle himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The conclusion of he argument of the Gospel. Controversy has prevailed from the days of Chrysostom to our own, as to whether these verses are the summary and conclusion of the Gospel as a whole, or have special reference to the record only of the appearances of Jesus after his resurrection. It cannot be doubted that as St. John sums up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12.htm">John 12</a>. the general teaching of Christ and its effect upon the people, to the termination of his public ministry, so at the close of this chapter, before recording the special bearing of the resurrection-life and spiritual power of Christ on the subsequent condition of the Church - a narrative of peculiar interest in itself, corresponding with the prologue of the entire narrative - he gathers up the general significance of his Gospel and its relation to other books. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many other signs therefore did Jesus also in the presence of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciples, which are not written in this book</span>. The "many" and "other" refer to those signs with which his readers may be familiar from other sources, and, as it seems to us, in other (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) books. We have seen throughout how thoroughly alive the evangelist is to the minutest details of the synoptic narrative. The word "many" seems most accurately to include more than the few appearances after his resurrection which are not mentioned by John, but which are recorded by the synoptists, and the "other" refers most probably to signs of a different class from those which he has selected. The "signs" written in this book are those central facts which formed the theme and starting-points of his discourses. "Signs" do not necessarily mean miraculous works (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>), but all "indications" or "tokens" of his higher nature and Divine commission, such as his appearance in the synagogue of Nazareth; the cleansing of the temple, which had so powerfully affected the mind of Nicodemus; the repeated assertion of his pre-existence and eternal glory; the feeling of the officers of the Sanhedrin, that "never man spake like this Man;" the effect produced by his lofty claims to be "Lord of the sabbath" and "greater than the temple;" the arrogation of power to forgive sins; the discomfiture of the deputation from chief priests and elders; the collapse of the Roman soldiers; and all other proofs of his supreme authority. All these <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> were not indispensably connected with corresponding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> "Before the disciples" suggests a special limitation and condition which took powerful hold upon the mind of the evangelist. We hear in one passage that "he could do no mighty works, because of their unbelief." To prepared minds he came with his spiritual revelations and special suggestions of heavenly origin. John sees the memories passing before him, which have already formed the heritage of the Church, and is reminded of "many ethers" which have never found a chronicler. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:30,31 There were other signs and proofs of our Lord's resurrection, but these were committed to writing, that all might believe that Jesus was the promised Messiah, the Saviour of sinners, and the Son of God; that, by this faith, they might obtain eternal life, by his mercy, truth, and power. May we believe that Jesus is the Christ, and believing may we have life through his name.</body></html>
