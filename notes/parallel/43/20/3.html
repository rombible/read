St. Luke mentions the visit of Peter only (24:12, but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-23.htm" title="Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.">John 20:23</a>); but here we have the whole scene pictured with all the vividness and exactness of one who stated what he himself saw and took part in.<p><span class= "bld">Peter therefore went forth, and . . . came to the sepulchre.</span>--In the original there is a change of tense here; the latter verb expressing the continuance of the journey towards the sepulchre.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Peter therefore went forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, aorist). This is a fact affirmed also by Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>), "But Peter arose and ran to the sepulcher." John adds, and the other disciple joined Peter, filled with a common amazement, and (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, imperfect) <span class="cmt_word">they went on their way toward the sepulcher. Now they were running</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, imperfect) <span class="cmt_word">both of them together: and the other disciple did outrun</span> - or, literally, ran in advance, more quickly than - <span class="cmt_word">Peter, and came first to the sepulcher</span>. The opponents of this Gospel supply numerous suggestions, with the view of obliterating this natural and lifelike touch. (<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is used instead of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 2 or the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>; but it is clear from the form of the following sentence, that <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x37e;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is different in meaning from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, and does not mean "right into," but "towards.") John, as the younger man, would soon outstrip the elderly disciple; and he simply records what in one sense is an insignificant detail, but one that could never be forgotten by him. There is no disposition to magnify himself, as Peter's part is obviously the more conspicuous. John runs more rapidly from his youth, the fervor of his nature, and the warmth of his affection; the reflection that he might have directly to convey the strange news to the mother of his Lord assisted to hurry him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-10 If Christ gave his life a ransom, and had not taken it again, it would not have appeared that his giving it was accepted as satisfaction. It was a great trial to Mary, that the body was gone. Weak believers often make that the matter of complaint, which is really just ground of hope, and matter of joy. It is well when those more honoured than others with the privileges of disciples, are more active than others in the duty of disciples; more willing to take pains, and run hazards, in a good work. We must do our best, and neither envy those who can do better, nor despise those who do as well as they can, though they come behind. The disciple whom Jesus loved in a special manner, and who therefore in a special manner loved Jesus, was foremost. The love of Christ will make us to abound in every duty more than any thing else. He that was behind was Peter, who had denied Christ. A sense of guilt hinders us in the service of God. As yet the disciples knew not the Scripture; they Christ must rise again from the dead.</body></html>
