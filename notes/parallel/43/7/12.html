Among these multitudes there arose, as before among the Jews and among the disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-41.htm" title="The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.">John 6:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-61.htm" title="When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Does this offend you?">John 6:61</a>), a murmuring; but the subject of this discussion is not His teaching, but His character. Their practical test-question was, Is He a good man, or a deceiver? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-63.htm" title="Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.">Matthew 27:63</a>.) Some would think of deeds and words which established His goodness beyond all doubt; but if He is a good man, then His claim cannot be false. Others would think of deceivers, who had led away the multitude before (comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/5-36.htm" title="For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.">Acts 5:36-37</a>), and that He was one of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him.</span> This vivid dramatic touch lifts a veil, and we see the eager excitement of those who fancied themselves duped, or who were at least disappointed by his non-appearance. Some said one thing, and some another. One group was loud in his praises, and another suspicious either of his orthodoxy or his patriotism, or both. <span class="cmt_word">Some said, He is a good man;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who was unselfish, kind, true, beneficent, and honest in his intentions, and one personally trustworthy. <span class="cmt_word">But others said</span> - or, <span class="accented">were saying</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the murmur, the head shaking, of others was a flat denial of his <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Nay</span>; but (on the other hand) <span class="cmt_word">he leadeth the multitude astray.</span> The "multitude" in this clause is probably the vulgar crowd, and the contemptuous reference to them may be the language of the Jerusalem populace rather than the provincial caravans. The multitude would escape from the Pharisaic leading strings, should they embrace his views either concerning the sabbath or the expected Messiah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-13 The brethren or kinsmen of Jesus were disgusted, when they found there was no prospect of worldly advantages from him. Ungodly men sometimes undertake to counsel those employed in the work of God; but they only advise what appears likely to promote present advantages. The people differed about his doctrine and miracles, while those who favoured him, dared not openly to avow their sentiments. Those who count the preachers of the gospel to be deceivers, speak out, while many who favour them, fear to get reproach by avowing regard for them.</body></html>
