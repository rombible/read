In the one case, the law which may not be broken is the law directing circumcision on the eighth day. In the other, "without breaking the law of Moses," refers to the law of the Sabbath. The rule of circumcision on the eighth day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-12.htm" title="And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of your seed.">Genesis 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-4.htm" title="And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.">Genesis 21:4</a>) was adopted in the Mosaic law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-3.htm" title="And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.">Leviticus 12:3</a>), and strictly adhered to--we have examples in the New Testament, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-59.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.">Luke 1:59</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-21.htm" title="And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.">Luke 2:21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm" title="Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;">Philippians 3:5</a>--and if the eighth day fell on the Sabbath, then, according to Rabbinic precept, "circumcision vacated the Sabbath." The school of Hillel the Great--and disciples of this school were at the time of our Lord the chief teachers at Jerusalem (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>)--gave as a reason for this that the "Sabbath Law was one of the Negative and the Circumcision Law one of the Positive Precepts, and that the Positive destroys the Negative." His appeal, then, is an example of His knowledge of their technical law, at which they wondered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm" title="And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?">John 7:15</a>. Indeed, the argument itself is an example of Hillel's first great law of interpretation--"that the Major may be inferred from the Minor." If circumcision be lawful on the Sabbath, much more is it lawful to restore the whole man. For other instances in which our Lord used this famous Canon of Interpretation, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-11.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?">Matthew 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-29.htm" title="Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.">Matthew 10:29-31</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man on</span> (<span class="cmt_word">a</span>) <span class="cmt_word">sabbath receive circumcision,</span> which was the removal by surgical means of what was regarded as a cause and sign of physical impurity, as well as the seal of the covenant made with the family of Abraham, that his seed should be heir of the world, and that in that seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed, <span class="cmt_word">in order that the law of Moses might not be broken.</span> It is not without difficulty that, in the previous verse, the law of circumcision on the eighth day is declared to be older than Moses, to have come down from the fathers of the consecrated race: how, then, does he call it the law of <span class="accented">Moses?</span> Clearly he refers to the fact that this particular law was embodied by Moses and made part of his own code, even though in one respect it was obviously older than the particular form of the fourth commandment, and must frequently clash with the letter of that commandment. The law of <span class="accented">Moses</span>, then, as much as the law of the Abrahamic covenant, would have been broken by any infraction of the rule which made circumcision incumbent on the eighth day. The common custom of the people was to adminster this rite on that day, even if it fell on a sabbath. "None of you keepeth the Law" in its Strict integrity, said Jesus. Nay, it is certain that the older laws, which Moses endorsed and embodied in his own code, do themselves demand such violation from you. This appeal to the spirit of the Law - the closest approach that a Jew could make to the will of God - is reproduced in Paul's Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a><span class="cmt_word">). Are ye</span> then <span class="cmt_word">wroth</span> <span class="cmt_word">with me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> (from <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;</span>, bile, gall) - to be bitter with wrath, and even mad with rage (Aristoph., 'Nub.,' 833), is found in 3Macc. 3:1, but not elsewhere in the New Testament) - <span class="cmt_word">because I made an entire man</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the whole frame of the paralyzed man (not his spirit or mind in contrast with his body) - <span class="cmt_word">sound</span> - or, <span class="accented">healthy</span> - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>on a sabbath day?</span> The antithesis is not between healing the wound of circumcision and healing the paralytic. Of the former there does not seem the faintest trace, notwithstanding the conjecture of Lampe. Circumcision was the removal of an offending portion of the human body, the sanitary purpose of which rite was strenuously believed in, but it was a partial cleansing and actual excision of one member of the body. To accomplish this purpose Moses, by his enactment, regarded even the sabbatic law as subsidiary. Why, then are the Jews wrathful with Jesus for making an entire man - a whole physical frame - healthful on the sabbath? The stress laid on the Authorized Version and R.T. translations, "every whit whole," by some commentaries is unfortunate; for it would throw discredit on circumcision altogether, which was far from our Lord's contention here, and would reduce the force of his argument. Christ does not in this argument take up the great line of defence pursued in ch. 5. Nor does he call the healing of the paralytic more than an <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a "work;" but it must be remembered that he had spoken on the previous occasion of his great miracles as "works," the like to which he saw the Father ever doing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-24 Every faithful minister may humbly adopt Christ's words. His doctrine is not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through the teaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb the world, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shall know whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak of themselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to the spiritual import of the Divine law. We must not judge concerning any by their outward appearance, but by their worth, and by the gifts and graces of God's Spirit in them.</body></html>
