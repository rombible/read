Without it, the words do not involve a change of purpose, and Porphyry's often-repeated charge of fickleness has no real ground. He is not going up unto the feast in the sense in which they intended--openly, with the usual caravan from Galilee. Another going up publicly, as they intended, and with an issue the dark presages of which now crowd upon Him, is present to His mind. "Ye, go ye up to the feast; <span class= "ital">I</span> go not up to <span class= "ital">this</span> feast." The verb is in the present, and its meaning does not exclude a going up afterwards. (See also Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-10.htm" title="But when his brothers were gone up, then went he also up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.">John 7:10</a>.) They were then going; the caravan was preparing to start. I am not going up (now). The time is coming, but it has not yet fully come. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,">Luke 9:51</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go ye up to the</span> <span class="cmt_word">feast</span>. "Join the pilgrim bands. Take part in the ceremonial of sacrifice and lustration. Be there in good time for the booth building. You have no testimony to deliver against the corruption of the holiest service, the hollowness of the ritual thanksgiving." <span class="cmt_word">I go not yet</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">this feast.</span> The text as it here stands frees the language of our Lord from the charge of Porphyry, or proves that it was founded on false premisses; though the fact that the apparent refusal was so soon followed by a compliance makes it probable that the real point of the sentence rests not so much on the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> as on the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. Not as a pilgrim, not in triumphal procession, would he go to the Feast of Tabernacles. He reserved that solemn sacrificial act for a later occasion, He would suffer as the Paschal Lamb, not go to Jerusalem to assert the completion of its acceptable year, and to foment the self-satisfaction of its religious guides. This is not satisfactory, because there is no feast the special features of which seemed to furnish our Lord with more obvious illustrations of his own work and Person. Moreover, he did make his appearance in the midst of the feast. So Godet and Meyer accepted the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span>, and urge therefrom the fact that Jesus deliberately altered his intention, so soon as a new motive sufficiently strong presented itself. With the assistance of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>, or with such an emphasis upon the present tense (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>) as to make it equivalent to the introduction of a <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, the passage means. "I am not going up <span class="accented">now."</span> Chrysostom, Lucke, De Wette, see in this suggestion the solution of the problem and a preparation for what follows. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "nigh" (ver. 2), may reasonably be interpreted with more latitude than is generally done. It might easily mean a date sufficiently near to be the topic of conversation in the family circle, even were it still a month before the celebration. The preparations may have been made, the pilgrims were beginning to assemble for their long journey, and the "not yet" and the emphasis on the present tense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> may easily have been conditioned by some of the special work which had still to be completed in Galilee on the way to Judaea and Persea. <span class="cmt_word">Because my season</span> - my special opportunity - <span class="cmt_word">has not been yet fulfilled;</span> or, <span class="accented">fully come.</span> Probably this clause points to the completion of the predestined hour of his consummation, of the baptism with which he should be baptized, the fire that he would kindle, the work which he would finish. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-13 The brethren or kinsmen of Jesus were disgusted, when they found there was no prospect of worldly advantages from him. Ungodly men sometimes undertake to counsel those employed in the work of God; but they only advise what appears likely to promote present advantages. The people differed about his doctrine and miracles, while those who favoured him, dared not openly to avow their sentiments. Those who count the preachers of the gospel to be deceivers, speak out, while many who favour them, fear to get reproach by avowing regard for them.</body></html>
