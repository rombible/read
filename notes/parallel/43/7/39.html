"Holy" before Ghost is also probably an insertion, though it is found in some of the oldest MSS. and versions. These are additions of copyists who were anxious to preserve from all possibility of misinterpretation the doctrine concerning the Holy Spirit. This doctrine is more fully expounded in John 14-16, where see Notes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This spake he,</span> <span class="cmt_word">said the evangelist, concerning the Spirit, which they that believe</span> <span class="cmt_word">on</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span> <span class="cmt_word">were to receive: for the</span> (Holy) <span class="cmt_word">Spirit</span> <span class="cmt_word">was</span> <span class="cmt_word">not yet</span> (given), <span class="cmt_word">because </span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> This verse has a great weight, as the evangelist's interpretation of the previous words of the Lord, nor can they be put aside. The history of the outpouring of the Spirit on Pentecost, and the mighty gift of the risen and glorified Jesus to those who believed on him, are their abundant justification. If the thirty-eighth verse were not an immense advance upon the promise of the thirty-seventh verse, it would not be easy to show how the words of the first promise could only find fulfilment in a future and as yet unrealized condition. Eternal life is a present gift. Satisfaction of the thirst of the soul was an immediate bestowment of Christ, and had been realized by untold multitudes of those who had been inwardly cleansed by the Spirit, who had come to the waters of life, who had received the Logos, and known that they were sons of God. But the thirty-eighth verse speaks of a new and nobler life flowing to others from belief in Christ. It looks forward to the production of a worldwide blessing conditioned by what was yet to happen. So that we cannot doubt that John saw more deeply into the Lord's words than some of those who have criticized his comment. John, says Weiss, does "not mean to explain the metaphor of the living water, but he intends to prove the truth of Jesus' promise from his own blessed experience." "<span class="accented">The</span> (<span class="accented">Holy</span>) <span class="accented">Spirit was not yet"</span> is, however, a strange and startling statement. The work and Person of the Spirit are spoken of throughout the Old Testament - from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>; to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>. The redeeming and renewing, quickening powers of the Spirit are represented as equipping judges, artists, warriors, and prophets for their work, as sanctifying the individual soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24, 27</a>), and building the temple of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a>). The prophetic gift is especially referred to the Spirit by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). More than this, our Lord himself is, in the synoptic Gospels, said to be conceived by the Holy Spirit, and his humanity baptized and anointed, empowered and directed throughout by the Spirit, and kept by him in sacred consecration and personal union with the Logos. The union of the Divine and human nature of Christ is maintained by that same Spirit who is the union of the Father and of the Son. In what sense can it be said, "the Holy Spirit was not yet"? Our Lord himself has thrown most light upon this perplexing saying when, on promising the Paraclete, he said, "He shall not speak of [or, 'from'] himself: he will take of mine, and show unto you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13, 14</a>); and when he declared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7-10</a>) that he must himself go to the Father, resume his antenatal glory, carry our nature, dishonoured by man, but now clothed with an infinite majesty, to the very throne of God, as the condition of the gift of the Paraclete. There was, in the constitution of nature, in the order of providence, in the revelations of the prophets, in the Person of the Son of man, that wherewith the blessed Spirit was ever and ceaselessly working; but not until the atonement was made, till God had glorified his Son Jesus, not until the Person of the God-Man was constituted in its infinity of power and perfection of sympathy, were the facts ready, were the truths liberated for the salvation of men, were the streams of living water ready to flow from every heart that received the Divine gift. In comparison with all previous manifestation of the Spirit, this was so wonderful that John could say of all that had gone before - "<span class="accented">not yet,"</span> "<span class="accented">not yet."</span> The Baptist's expression, "I knew him not" (see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>), and the scene described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21, 22</a>, do not contradict this (see note). This is the first time that John mentions the glorification of the Son of mart. Jesus certainly looked at his death, with what followed it, as his glory (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>, etc.; John 13:31; 17:5). This evangelist does not, so clearly as St. Paul (says Westcott), discriminate the two stages of "humiliation" and "glory" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2.htm">Philippians 2</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5, 8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:37-39 On the last day of the feast of tabernacles, the Jews drew water and poured it out before the Lord. It is supposed that Christ alluded to this. If any man desires to be truly and for ever happy, let him apply to Christ, and be ruled by him. This thirst means strong desires after spiritual blessings, which nothing else can satisfy; so the sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit, were intended by the waters which Jesus called on them to come to Him and drink. The comfort flows plentifully and constantly as a river; strong as a stream to bear down the opposition of doubts and fears. There is a fulness in Christ, of grace for grace. The Spirit dwelling and working in believers, is as a fountain of living, running water, out of which plentiful streams flow, cooling and cleansing as water. The miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit we do not expect, but for his more common and more valuable influences we may apply. These streams have flowed from our glorified Redeemer, down to this age, and to the remote corners of the earth. May we be anxious to make them known to others.</body></html>
