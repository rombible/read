The right reading is, <span class= "ital">But when His brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went He also up</span>; and the difference is not unimportant. We have seen that, even with the ordinary reading, there is no ground for the frequent objection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-8.htm" title="Go you up to this feast: I go not up yet to this feast: for my time is not yet full come.">John 7:8</a>), but it is really nowhere said that He went up to the feast at all. As a matter of fact, the special feast day--the day of Holy Convocation--was on the 15th of Tishri, the 14th being the preparation day. From the 16th to the 20th was what was called "The Lesser Festival," or "The Middle of the Feast" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-14.htm" title="Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.">John 7:14</a>), and it is at this we find Him present. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Not openly, but as it were in secret</span>--i.e., not with the usual company. Judging from His practice at another time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-4.htm" title="And he must needs go through Samaria.">John 4:4</a>), He would go through Samaria, while the caravan would go on the Eastern side of the Jordan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when his brethren were gone up to the</span> <span class="cmt_word">feast,</span> <span class="cmt_word">then</span> <span class="cmt_word">went he also up, not manifestly, but as it were in secret</span>. The emendation of the text is important, for it draws attention to the fact that, while the brethren went up <span class="accented">to the feast</span>, he simply <span class="accented">went up</span>, towards Jerusalem - not, however, in the pilgrim caravan, but as a quiet wayfarer, blessing lepers, comforting souls, pouring forth on a favoured few his truth, till he reached the certain village at the very gates of Jerusalem. What a contrast there was between the first visit (ch. 2.), when he appeared suddenly in the temple, and cast out the money changers, or that when (ch. 5.) he went to the "unnamed" feast as a pilgrim! The hostility has deepened; the "world" hates its Saviour, because he would save it from its sins, interpret it to itself, and offer spiritual rather than temporal benediction. The phrase, "in secret," has led some of the Tubingen school to suggest a docetic view of the Person of Christ; but the suggestion is reckless and absurd. Moulten, who conceives that the mission of the seventy disciples preceded this advent, says even this does not clash with the idea of a virtually secret and retired advance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-13 The brethren or kinsmen of Jesus were disgusted, when they found there was no prospect of worldly advantages from him. Ungodly men sometimes undertake to counsel those employed in the work of God; but they only advise what appears likely to promote present advantages. The people differed about his doctrine and miracles, while those who favoured him, dared not openly to avow their sentiments. Those who count the preachers of the gospel to be deceivers, speak out, while many who favour them, fear to get reproach by avowing regard for them.</body></html>
