(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-30.htm" title="I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.">John 5:30</a>.) Then he had again and again referred to the Father who sent Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-24.htm" title="Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.">John 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-36.htm" title="What manner of saying is this that he said, You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come?">John 7:36-38</a>), and claimed as His own work the doing of the Father's will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm" title="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.">John 7:30</a>). In the Capernaum synagogue, in the hearing of some of these Jews, He had declared that all who were taught of God, and heard and learned the lesson, would come to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm" title="It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to me.">John 6:45</a>). There is, then, no ground for their present wonder. The teaching which is His in relation to them, is not His of original source. He claims to be in His humanity as a messenger, carrying the message of Him that sent Him. He is the Word by whom the mind of God is spoken.<p><span class= "bld">Doctrine</span> represents a word which is frequently used in the Gospels, of our Lord, but only here and in the next verse by Him. It has acquired a definite and concrete meaning not found in the original, which is better rendered by <span class= "ital">teaching</span> (comp., <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-2.htm" title="And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his doctrine,">Mark 4:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore</span> <span class="cmt_word">answered them and said</span>, etc. He met this particular allegation as follows: <span class="cmt_word">My teaching is not mine.</span> The "my" refers to the teaching itself, the "mine" to the ultimate authority on which it rests. I am not a self-taught Man, as though out of the depths of my own independent human consciousness I span it. I do not mean you to suppose that my mere human experience is the sole source of my instructions (ch. 5:31). If you have sat at the feet of those who taught you, I, too, am a Representative of another; <span class="cmt_word">but</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> is not equivalent to <span class="accented">tam...quam.</span> It introduces here the absolute source of all his teaching) it is the teaching <span class="cmt_word">of him who sent me.</span> I have not learned in your schools, but am uttering the thoughts that come from an infinitely deeper source. "He who sent me" gave them to me. I have been in intimate communion with HIM. All that I say is Divine thought. I have drawn it all from the Lord of all. I came from him, and represent to you the will of God. This is a lofty prophetic claim, more urgent, more complete, than that made by Moses or Isaiah. Special messages, oracles, and burdens were delivered by the prophets with a "Thus saith the Lord." But Jesus says <span class="accented">his</span> thoughts are God's thoughts, his ways God's ways, <span class="accented">his</span> teachings not his own, but altogether those of him who sent him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-24 Every faithful minister may humbly adopt Christ's words. His doctrine is not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through the teaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb the world, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shall know whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak of themselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to the spiritual import of the Divine law. We must not judge concerning any by their outward appearance, but by their worth, and by the gifts and graces of God's Spirit in them.</body></html>
