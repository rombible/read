This was the technical <span class= "ital">Ch?l M?'?d</span> or <span class= "ital">M?'?d Kat?n, "</span>the Middle of the Feast," or "the Lesser Feast." He had taken no part in the greater festival itself, and now He appears in the Temple, as far as we know, for the first time as a public teacher, probably (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-19.htm" title="Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why go you about to kill me?">John 7:19</a>) as an expounder of some Scripture which had been read.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When it was already the midst of the feast;</span> or, <span class="accented">when already the festival had reached the middle stage.</span> Since the feast lasted seven or eight days, this is reasonably supposed to be on the fourth day. We may presume that he had been spending a few days at Bethany (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38</a>), front retirement of which he issued rather as a Prophet and Teacher than as the Messiah of the popular expectation. <span class="cmt_word">He went up</span> - he came suddenly - <span class="cmt_word">into the temple,</span> into the midst of the crowds where his followers would be found, who would shield him, humanly speaking, from the covert designs of his angry assailants. "He was adorned with the wreath of popular veneration, till this wreath was torn and withered by the poisonous breath of their enmity" (Lange). He went up into the temple, <span class="cmt_word">and taught</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, continuously taught). We can only conjecture the theme of these instructions. They must have been sufficiently varied and peculiar to have excited much attention. Either parable, or apothegm, or stirring appeal, or quotation and interpretation from the Old Testament, or voice from the fathomless depths of his own consciousness, may have formed its staple. In his burning summons to conscience, and his gracious offers of mercy, the people who had listened to him on the mountainside or lakeside were accustomed to say, "He speaks with authority, not as the scribes." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-24 Every faithful minister may humbly adopt Christ's words. His doctrine is not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through the teaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb the world, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shall know whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak of themselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to the spiritual import of the Divine law. We must not judge concerning any by their outward appearance, but by their worth, and by the gifts and graces of God's Spirit in them.</body></html>
