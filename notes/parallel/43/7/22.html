The reading of our version is, however, better supported, and agrees better with the writer's style. "On this account hath Moses given you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers." The argument is, "Ye circumcise on the Sabbath day because circumcision is part of the Mosaic law; but Moses gave you circumcision because he had an anterior and higher authority for it, and in practice you recognise this and make it override the Sabbath. But if circumcision is allowed, why not a deed of mercy? This is the practice and precept of your rulers. But if a patriarchal rite is greater than the Mosaic Sabbath, because the fathers were anterior to Moses, how much more an act of love, which is anterior to all time."<p><span class= "bld">A man.</span>--Used here, and in the next verse, as equivalent to a male child, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm" title="A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.">John 16:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses on this</span> <span class="cmt_word">account</span> (for this cause) <span class="cmt_word">hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">given</span> (assigned) <span class="cmt_word">you</span> <span class="cmt_word">the circumcision</span> (<span class="cmt_word">not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers</span>). If we accept the text as above, the question arises - Does it refer to the parenthetical clause or to the principal verb? Meyer renders as follows: "Therefore Moses gave you circumcision, not because it originated with Moses, but (because it originated) with the fathers, and so ye circumcise," etc., making the precedence of the law of circumcision to the sabbatic law part of the very purport of his appointment. But many others, "For this cause" - to teach this lesson - Moses, who gave the ten commandments, one of which involved the sabbatic rest, took up into the Law which he gave you the still older law of the Abrahamic covenant, and laid down the stringent rule that the rite must be performed on the eighth day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>) - a principle which was seen to involve the infringement of the sabbath law. This is, in substance, the view of Moulton, Lange, Westcott, and others. To expound the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> by the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is (Westcott) contrary to the usage of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-24.htm">2 Corinthians 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-17.htm">Philippians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a>; but it is still more against the argument. Moses did not give circumcision because it was of the fathers, - at least that is not the point; but Jesus argues that he gave circumcision as a mode of legislation which will involve a modification of his own sabbatic regimen. Stringent as was the law of the sabbath, it would have, on occasion, to yield to the more searching and stringent rule of admission into the covenant of grace. "If the sabbath could give way to a mere ceremonial law, how much more to a work of mercy, which is older and higher than any ritual!" 'Mish. Sabb.,' 19:1, fol. 128, <span class="accented">b</span>, "Everything required for circumcision may be completed on the sabbath;" and so 19:2. The reason is given: 'Midrash Tanchuma,' fol. 9, <span class="accented">b</span>, "The healing of a sick man dangerously ill, and circumcision, break through the sabbath sanctity." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-24 Every faithful minister may humbly adopt Christ's words. His doctrine is not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through the teaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb the world, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shall know whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak of themselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to the spiritual import of the Divine law. We must not judge concerning any by their outward appearance, but by their worth, and by the gifts and graces of God's Spirit in them.</body></html>
