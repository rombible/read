This thought follows naturally on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17-18</a>, and, like the whole of this teaching, grows out of the truths of John 5; but it may be that this reference to Moses and the Law has a special fitness, as suggested by the feast. Moses had commanded that the Law should be read in every Sabbatical year at this very festival (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,">Deuteronomy 31:10</a>); and there is good reason for believing that the current year was a Sabbatical year. The first portion of the Law which it was customary to read was <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-3.htm" title="Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>. Within this section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>) came the command, "Thou shalt not kill." They were, then, in their persecution of Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a>), breaking the Law, of which their presence at the feast was a professed obedience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Jesus was not unaware that serious charges were brought against his interpretation of the sabbatic law; that the Jews sought to kill him for his identification of his own mind and working with the Father's mind and working. On this account for a considerable time he had confined his ministry to Galilee. The old story of the sabbath healing was now rife once more, doubtless augmented with the rumors of the healing of the man with the withered hand, and other actions profoundly in harmony with the deep meaning of the sabbath rest. To the mind of the fourth evangelist; the explanation given by Christ to the authorities in Jerusalem was of prime significance in the whole sabbatic controversy; and he has recorded the defence Jesus made of his doctrine which placed him at once on the platform of the men with whom he was now beginning a life-and-death conflict. He used their methods, and, so far as the adequate grounds of connection were concerned, he was triumphant, <span class="cmt_word">Did</span> <span class="cmt_word">not</span> <span class="cmt_word">Moses give</span> <span class="cmt_word">you the Law?</span> - the whole revealed Law of God concerning moral conduct and daily ritual, a violation of the real spirit of which would be <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and of which you accuse me - <span class="cmt_word">and</span> (yet) <span class="cmt_word">none of you doeth the Law?</span> Does he here call attention to the universal disobedience of mankind? Is he forestalling the declaration that "all have sinned, and come short;" that "in many things all offend"? Certainly not. He is about to show at greater length that the charge of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> stands equally against the justifiable transposition of the letter of the lower law by the incidence of a higher law. They must all know the innumerable occasions in which the letter of the law of the sabbath gave way to the law of mercy, to the law of hunger, to the exigencies of the temple services. "None of you doeth the Law," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the sense in which you are (from other motives) expecting me to do it. He said enough to strike their consciences and charge home their cherished if secret purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Why do ye seek to kill me?</span> With what right, since this is the case, do ye vent your malice against <span class="accented">me</span>? Meyer and Godet here differ as to the emphasis laid upon the "me<span class="accented">."</span> The position of the enclitic <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> gives it a prominence not to be overlooked. The interpretation of many - that the intention or desire to kill Jesus is the inward proof that the conscience of the Jews would admit that they were not keeping the Law which said, "Thou shalt not kill" - is very far-fetched, and weak in its force, although, according to the entire old covenant, there was much killing which was not murder. Such a reference would not correspond with the profoundly Hebrew response made by our Lord. Calvin here makes this reply of Christ a text on which to denounce, in his own day, the corruption of the papal court. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:14-24 Every faithful minister may humbly adopt Christ's words. His doctrine is not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through the teaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb the world, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shall know whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak of themselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to the spiritual import of the Divine law. We must not judge concerning any by their outward appearance, but by their worth, and by the gifts and graces of God's Spirit in them.</body></html>
