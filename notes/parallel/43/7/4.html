The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> says Meyer, is "to be the opposite of a shy and timid nature," which is very unmeaning.

Wisd. 5:1, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). So Luthardt: "It denotes that which is <span class="accented">open</span>, in contrast to that which is <span class="accented">concealed."</span> Westcott settles the meaning of the word by the remark that "the phrase (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) is commonly used by the rabbinical writers for 'in public,' as opposed to 'in secret.'" The man who persists in quiet, secret ways of acting, and strenuously avoids publicity, is not the man who seeketh to be illustrious and conspicuous. The brethren see a palpable contradiction between the claims which Jesus is making and the comparative retirement to which he is confining himself. The crowds of the Galilaean lake are blank retirement when compared with the metropolis in the great climacteric festival of the year. The brethren call on Christ to solve the contradiction. It cannot be concealed that Jesus had (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2</a>) repeatedly said, "No man lighteth a lamp and putteth it under a bushel, but on a candlestick," etc.; and so the brothers use Christ's words against himself. But the Lord's idea of needful manifestation, both as to degree, time, and place, was accurately realized and represented in both narratives. <span class="cmt_word">If thou doest these things</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;</span> is simply the logical premise, without necessarily throwing doubt on the facts. It is not equal, however, to the particle <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "since." Admitting these works to be real, and these mighty deeds to be correctly reported, there, is from the standpoint of the brethren no other course than that which they suggest: <span class="cmt_word">Manifest thyself to</span> <span class="cmt_word">the world;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "proceed to the widest arena at once;" "thou art compromising thyself by thy retirement;" "what thou art doing with one hand thou art undoing with the other." "All the Israel world from all lands is crowding to the great feast, thy disciples amongst them; make thyself known; claim the place that belongs to thee." It must be remembered that the disciples (Judas, not Iscariot, especially) said on the very night of the Passion, "How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?" This slight note of resemblance with the form of the present admonition of the brothers, is more coincident in the letter than the spirit, and received from the Lord a profoundly different reply (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22, 23</a>, notes). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-13 The brethren or kinsmen of Jesus were disgusted, when they found there was no prospect of worldly advantages from him. Ungodly men sometimes undertake to counsel those employed in the work of God; but they only advise what appears likely to promote present advantages. The people differed about his doctrine and miracles, while those who favoured him, dared not openly to avow their sentiments. Those who count the preachers of the gospel to be deceivers, speak out, while many who favour them, fear to get reproach by avowing regard for them.</body></html>
