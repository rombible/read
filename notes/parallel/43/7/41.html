Was he not called "Jesus of Nazareth"? His life had been spent there, his ministry in the main restricted to the northern province. These questions give a vivid scene and portray a great emotion. The people are resting on the letter of prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), where the Messiah, as understood by their own teachers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-5.htm">Matthew 2:5</a>), was to proceed from Bethlehem; but they overlook the remarkable prediction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>, where Galilee is spoken of as the scene of extraordinary illumination. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:40-53 The malice of Christ's enemies is always against reason, and sometimes the staying of it cannot be accounted for. Never any man spake with that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that sweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a time restrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily lose their convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayed by outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to be damned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses things which men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom God has chosen. The Lord brings forward his weak and timid disciples, and sometimes uses them to defeat the designs of his enemies.</body></html>
