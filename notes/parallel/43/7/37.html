The words commanding the observance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm" title="You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days:">Numbers 29:12</a>, mention only seven days; but this latter passage is followed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a> by a reference to the solemn assembly on the eighth day. With this agree the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-35.htm" title="On the first day shall be an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:35-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm" title="Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.">Leviticus 23:39</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-18.htm" title="Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the manner.">Nehemiah 8:18</a>. Later the eight days of the festival are certainly spoken of as in the Talmud, in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/10-6.htm" title="And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held the feast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains and dens like beasts.">2 Maccabees 10:6</a>, and Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. iii.</span> 10, ? 4. The best modern authorities are for the most part agreed that it was the eighth day, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the 22nd of Tishri, that is here referred to. It was the "great day" as the octave of the feast, and the day of holy convocation.<p><span class= "bld">Jesus stood and cried.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>. Here the vivid remembrance of the writer remembers the attitude as well as the voice.<p><span class= "bld">If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span>--These words were almost certainly suggested by part of the ritual of the festival, which consisted in a solemn procession with music, and headed by a priest, which went on each morning from the Temple to the pool of Siloam, where the priest filled a golden vase with water and carried it to the Temple amid the joyful cries of the people. He then poured it out on the western side of the altar of burnt-offering; while another priest poured a drink-offering of wine, at the same time, on the eastern side of the altar, and the people during this act chanted the words of "the Hallel," Psalms 113-118. If we accept the eighth day as that referred to in this verse, then this ceremony was. not repeated; but its very absence may have suggested the fuller declaration of the reality of which it was the representation. The current Rabbinical interpretation of the symbolism connected it with the gift of the latter rain, which was at this season; and also with the gift of the Holy Spirit. The Talmud says expressly, "Therefore is its name called the house of drawing, because from thence is drawn the Holy Spirit," as it is said, "with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation" (<span class= "ital">Jer. Succa,</span> v. 1). Thoughts like these would be connected with this ritual by the Jews and by Jesus Himself, and the exact form which His own thought takes is marked by the words, "If any man thirst." He stands there on the great day of the feast, and around Him are men who for seven successive mornings have witnessed acts and uttered words telling, though they know it not, of the true satisfaction of spiritual thirst, and thinking of the descent of showers on the thirsty ground, and in some vague way of the Holy Spirit's presence. They are as the woman of Samaria was by the side of the true well. For every one who really knew his need, the source of living water was at hand. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-7.htm" title="There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.">John 4:7-15</a>.) That very Feast of Tabernacles, with its dwelling in tents, moreover, brought vividly to their minds the wilderness-life; and as in the past chapter the manna has formed the basis of His teaching about the Bread of Life, so here the striking of the rock and the streams gushing forth in the desert would be present to their minds. In the interpretation of one who was himself a Pharisee, and was taught in the schools of Jerusalem, "that rock was Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37-39.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <span class="accented">The claim to be Organ and Giver of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now on the last day, the great day of the feast.</span> A question arises - Was the last day the seventh or the eighth day? and why was it called the great day? The question cannot be finally answered. The Feast of Tabernacles, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>, is said to last seven days; and, so far as the Mosaic ceremonial goes, the ceremonial of the seventh day was less imposing and festive than either of the preceding days. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a> shows that the eighth day was also celebrated as a solemn assembly, on which no servile work could be done (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-18.htm">Nehemiah 8:18</a>). In 2 Macc. 10:6 eight days of the feast were spoken cf. On the day of holy convocation the people removed or left their booths, and thus commemorated, with great rejoicing, the close of the wilderness period and the commencement of their national history. It may, moreover, have been called "the great day" because it was the closing day of all the festivals of the year. Josephus calls it "the very sacred close (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the year." The LXX. gives the curious translation <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, for <span class="accented">azereth</span>, equivalent to "assembly." This <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> Philo ('De Septenaris') describes as the end of the festivals of the sacred year. Meyer, Alford, Godet, Lange, and many others regard the eighth day as that here referred to by the word "great," and find, in the very absence of the ceremonial of drawing water from the Pool of Siloam, the occasion which provoked the reference of our Lord to his own power to meet the spiritual thirst of mankind, thus repeating what he had said to the woman of Samaria of his own grace, with further and nobler expansions. The songs which had been sung on every previous day of the feast were sung without the special rejoicings and water ceremonial. Hence some have thought that the very contrast between the previous days and this last day, "great" in other respects, may have made the reference quite as impressive as if the following words had been spoken in some pause, or at the conclusion of the great Hallel of the seventh day. So Westcott. It should, however, be noted that Rabbi Juda (in the Genesisara on 'Succah') asserts that the water pouring took place on the eighth day as well. This is supposed, by Lange, to be inaccurate or a later addition. Edersheim, however, has given strong reasons for believing that very special ceremonial took place on the <span class="accented">seventh</span> day. The people, all carrying in both hands their palm, myrtle, and citron branches, divided into three companies, one of which waited in the temple, one went to Moya to fetch willow branches to adorn the altar, and a third repaired with music to the Pool of Siloam, where the priest filled his golden goblet with water, and returned, with blast of trumpet, by the water gate, to the court of the priests. There he was joined by other priests with vessels of wine. The water was poured into the silver funnel, and at this act burst forth the great Hallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>) in responsive chorus. The people shook their palm branches as they sang the words, "Oh, give thanks unto the Lord." On the last day, the great day of the feast, the priests compassed the altar seven times before the sacrifices were kindled, and the songs accompanying the ceremony of this day were called "the great Hosanna." As the people left the temple they shook off their willow leaves on the altar, and beat their palm branches to pieces. Edersheim thinks that it was at the moment when the pause after the great Hallel occurred that Jesus lifted up his voice, and there is much probability in the suggestion. Alford, accepting the <span class="accented">non</span>-pouring of the water on the eighth day, considers that the very absence of that ceremonial provided the opportunity for the great utterance which follows. Chrysostom says, on the eighth day, "when they were returning home, he g - adopting an unusual attitude of command, and unaccustomed energy of voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-35.htm">John 1:35</a> and ver. 28, note) ? <span class="cmt_word">If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</span> Christ thus identifies himself with the deepest meaning of the Old Testament and the Hebrew ritual. The sabbath and the temple found the highest expression of their meaning in his life and work. Godet thinks that the underlying reference here was to that of which the ceremonial was a memorial, and pointed to the smiting of the rock in the wilderness, from whose hidden depths the rushing waters flowed. The cry, "If any man thirst," might certainly recall the terrible drought in the wilderness, though there does not seem to me any definite reference to it in what follows. The libation of water was certainly not offered to the multitudes to drink, but the ritual use of water treats it as an dement absolutely essential to our human life. The people gave thanks that they had reached a land where fell the early and latter rain, and fountains and wells and springs of living water ran. Christ offered more than all - the utter final quenching of all torturing thirst. The people sang <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>, "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." He said, "Come to me," and your joy shall be full. To the woman at the well he had said that the water he would give should be in the soul as a well of water springing up into eternal life. but in this connection he promised a much more precious gift. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:37-39 On the last day of the feast of tabernacles, the Jews drew water and poured it out before the Lord. It is supposed that Christ alluded to this. If any man desires to be truly and for ever happy, let him apply to Christ, and be ruled by him. This thirst means strong desires after spiritual blessings, which nothing else can satisfy; so the sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit, were intended by the waters which Jesus called on them to come to Him and drink. The comfort flows plentifully and constantly as a river; strong as a stream to bear down the opposition of doubts and fears. There is a fulness in Christ, of grace for grace. The Spirit dwelling and working in believers, is as a fountain of living, running water, out of which plentiful streams flow, cooling and cleansing as water. The miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit we do not expect, but for his more common and more valuable influences we may apply. These streams have flowed from our glorified Redeemer, down to this age, and to the remote corners of the earth. May we be anxious to make them known to others.</body></html>
