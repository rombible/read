It is asked in the bitterness of disappointed craft. In the presence of the multitude they dared not proceed by open force, and the influence they feared was every hour gaining ground. If their officers could have brought Him on some technical charge away from the people and into their own chamber, all would then have been in their own hands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 45, 46.</span> - In ver. 32 we learn that Pharisees and chief priests had sent "officers" to lay hands on him, to seize their opportunity for an arrest; but, sharing somewhat the outburst of enthusiasm which wavered between his claims to be the Prophet or the Christ, and only subsided for a moment on a miserable and unveracious plea, they did not dare to execute the command of their masters. <span class="cmt_word">The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees (</span>the absence of the article <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> shows that they were regarded as one body, who had charged these officers to undertake the duty in which they signally failed); <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">they</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, the latter) <span class="cmt_word">said</span> <span class="cmt_word">to them, Why did ye not bring him?</span> Foiled in their intention to carry out the order of the committee of the council, they return empty handed, and to some extent baffled and chagrined. They had fallen into the dominant enthusiasm of the crowd for a moment. They had heard the shouts which hailed him as the great Prophet, nay, as Messiah himself, and their reply, according to the curtailed text, was, <span class="cmt_word">Never</span> <span class="cmt_word">man so spake.</span> It matters little whether the additional clause, "as this Man speaks," was in the original text or not, the idea is the same; and it confirms the supposition to which we have often referred - that John only gives us the great sentences which the Divine Lord made the text of a discourse. An overwhelming impression was produced that the Speaker had a deep secret to disclose, vast treasure to bestow, unlimited power to meet the thirst of man, and even to make those who utterly yield to his influence the fountains of benedictions to others. An awe as of unseen things fell on the officers and the people. They could not resist the sense of benediction which, like some sacred perfume, some supernatural glamour, fell upon them in his reval words. "Never man thus spake." The whole experience is new and wonderful. "These sayings of the Prophet of Nazareth are more than words; they have living powers; they have confounded and disarmed us<span class="accented">."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:40-53 The malice of Christ's enemies is always against reason, and sometimes the staying of it cannot be accounted for. Never any man spake with that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that sweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a time restrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily lose their convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayed by outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to be damned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses things which men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom God has chosen. The Lord brings forward his weak and timid disciples, and sometimes uses them to defeat the designs of his enemies.</body></html>
