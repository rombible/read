Our Lord returns to the words, and explains them more fully, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-9.htm" title="I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.">John 10:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Allegory of the door and the fold</span>, <span class="accented">in which Christ claims to be</span> "the <span class="accented">Door of the sheep</span>." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, with its resumptive force, introduces the effect upon Christ of the unsusceptible character of the Pharisees). Some pause may have occurred, during which these men displayed their bitter feeling and utter lack of appreciation, and he proceeds first to give them an explanation of the words, which should leave them in no doubt as to <span class="accented">one</span> emphatic meaning which they contained; <span class="cmt_word">Said</span> <span class="cmt_word">again unto them, I am the Door of the sheep,</span> This exposition of the allegory is introduced by the solemn <span class="cmt_word">Amen, amen</span>. Christ first calls attention to the "door" into the sacred fellowship of men with God. On a subsequent occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), he said, "I am the Way" to the Father; "no man cometh unto the Father, but by <span class="accented">me</span>." The parable as it stands refers to true and false teachers of the people, and to just and unjust claims to confer upon the sheep of God's pasture safe and sure access to God, and all privileges of Divine life. In interpreting it, he declares first that he is the one <span class="accented">Door</span>, not of "the fold" so much as <span class="accented">of the sheep</span>, in their individual capacity. This corresponds with every claim made by him and made in his Name, that he, in all the fullness of his Personality, had always been the one Medium by which, in the theocracy or beyond it, men have drawn near to the Father. The Logos is the Angel of the covenant, the Rock in the wilderness, the great High Priest, the Veil over the holy place, the propitiatory Sacrifice, the Prophet, the King. He it is who ever and always has given consolation and peace to his people. He is the one method, agency, reality, by which not only the shepherds, but the sheep, enter into the fold, and go forth thence to pasture. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-9 Many who hear the word of Christ, do not understand it, because they will not. But we shall find one scripture expounding another, and the blessed Spirit making known the blessed Jesus. Christ is the Door. And what greater security has the church of God than that the Lord Jesus is between it and all its enemies? He is a door open for passage and communication. Here are plain directions how to come into the fold; we must come in by Jesus Christ as the Door. By faith in him as the great Mediator between God and man. Also, we have precious promises to those that observe this direction. Christ has all that care of his church, and every believer, which a good shepherd has of his flock; and he expects the church, and every believer, to wait on him, and to keep in his pasture.</body></html>
