Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1</a>. The Sinaitic MS. and several of the early versions read this verse without the words translated "before Me," but the balance of authority is strongly in their favour; and the fact of their being hard to understand, or having been misunderstood, is the probable reason of their omission. Retaining them, as we seem bound to do, we are also bound to give them their ordinary temporal meaning. There can be but one rendering which suggests itself to the unbiassed mind, and that is the rendering of our version. The Greek words and the English words are equally plain, and other renderings are due to the exigencies of interpretation.<p>What, then, do the words mean? Their force seems to be all-inclusive; and yet they cannot contradict Christ's own words, which have excluded Abraham, Moses, the prophets, John the Baptist, from any possibility of such thoughts. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm" title="You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.">John 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-33.htm" title="You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.">John 5:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-19.htm" title="Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why go you about to kill me?">John 7:19</a>.) They cannot, on the other hand, be limited to false Christs, who did not come before but after our Lord. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm" title="I am come in my Father's name, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.">John 5:43</a>.) Here, as often, the true meaning seems for the most part to have been overlooked because men have sought it elsewhere than in the words themselves, and in their place among other words. The thought which precedes and which follows is that Jesus is Himself "the door." "All that ever came before Me" is in immediate contrast to this thought, and the sense is, "all professing to be themselves the door, to be the means by which men enter the fold, to be the Mediator between man and God." The Old Testament teachers cannot be meant, because they witnessed to the true door. But there had been growing up since the return from the Captivity, and the close of the Old Testament canon, a priestly caste in the place of the prophetic schools, and these men had been in practice, if not in word, claiming for themselves the position of door to the kingdom of God. There were Hillels and Shammais, heads of parties and of factions, whose word was to their followers as the word of God; there were Pharisees then standing round Him who had solemnly decreed that any one who should confess Him to be the Messiah should be shut out from Temple and from synagogue, and that they themselves would in God's name pronounce a curse upon his head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm" title="These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.">John 9:22</a>). As "thieves" were they, and as "robbers;" wolves in sheep's clothing, stealing into the flock of Christ and rending those who were the true sheep. (Comp. the analogous language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-52.htm" title="Woe to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in you hindered.">Luke 11:52</a>.) The lawyers closed the door and plundered and oppressed those whom they kept outside.<p>Attention should be paid to the present tense of the verb "are" in this sentence, which seems in itself to suggest that the words which follow find their application in the case of the persons then actually living.<p><span class= "bld">But the sheep did not hear them.</span>--Read again <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3-5</a>. What is true of the sheep and the voice of the stranger is true also of man and of every voice which is not of God. The heart of the child answers to the voice of the Father; it trembles at any voice which is unknown. The conscience of mankind knows the voice of God; but it will not hear the voice of the devil, nor the unreal voice of man claiming to speak in God's name. It will not call bitter, sweet; nor sweet, bitter; darkness, light; nor light, darkness. It will not accept the false, the impure, the wrong, for it is the God in man which ever is, and ever must be true and holy and right. So it was that the teaching of scribes and Pharisees never really influenced the masses of the people, for it was concerned with the externals of matter and form, and they wanted the living truth. So it has been that systems of error have had their day, but have had no principle of life, because they were not the voice of God speaking to the heart of man; and in so far as they have lived at all, it has been because the error has been but in the form, or has been in part only of the substance, which has also contained some germ of truth. So it has been in every age, and in every school of thought, that the men whom the sheep have heard have been men who have had in them the ring of the true, and have been as prophets uttering the voice of God. Witness Paul of Tarsus, and Francis of Assisi; Luther, and Savonarola; John Knox, and John Wesley; Charles Simeon, and John Keble.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that came before me</span> <span class="cmt_word">are thieves and robbers</span>. Great difficulty has been felt by commentators in understanding "before me." The words clearly gave the early Gnostic heretics a text on which they established their dualistic rejection of the old dispensation. Their absence from certain texts led Augustine and others to emphasize the word "came." "All who <span class="accented">came</span>," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in their own strength or wisdom, when not "<span class="accented">sent"</span> or authorized by God. Other endeavors have been made (see Meyer and Lunge) to give it a non-temporal meaning, such as <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, "independently of <span class="accented">me</span>." Wolf and Olshausen make <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>, "<span class="accented">in</span> the place" or "in the stead of me" (so Lunge, Lampe, Schleusner). De Wette and others accept the temporal meaning, "before," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in point of time, and include under it the entire <span class="accented">corpus</span> of Old Testament saints and teachers, and therefore regard the saying as inconsistent with the gentleness of Christ. But with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39, 45-47</a>, and many other passages in this Gospel, it is certain the words could not mean to denounce all who came as teachers or shepherds before him in mere <span class="accented">point of time</span> as "thieves and robbers," whom the sheep did not hear. Therefore the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> must be to some extent modified in meaning. We agree with Westcott and Godet in limiting <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span>, by throwing the emphasis on the "came," and by adding, moreover, to it the essential point, "came making themselves doors of the sheep" - claiming to have the "key of knowledge," professing vainly to open or shut the door of heaven. That is, no other has ever had the right or claim to be such "a door." The Baptist, the prophets, one by one, Abraham and Moses, in their day made no such profession. The dignity belongs to Christ alone. The language may receive accentuation from the pressing urgency of false Christs, as well as the hopeless system of Pharisaic pride. Theme sees here the mere dressing out of St. Paul's language, condemnatory of false prophets and ravening wolves who would not spare the flock of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>), and Christ's own words in the synoptists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>, etc.). Special reference is made to the ceremonial superstitions, to "the hedge about the Law," to the cruel slavery of modern Pharisaism, which had done what neither prophets nor priests of old had attempted. Archdeacon Watkins emphasizes the present tense, "<span class="accented">are</span> thieves," etc., making Christ's reference obvious to the lawyers and scribes of his own day, who were closing the door, and plundering those whom they kept out of the kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">But the sheep did not hear them</span>. The true sheep have not been seduced by them. The teaching of these Pharisees has not prevailed over susceptible souls. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-9 Many who hear the word of Christ, do not understand it, because they will not. But we shall find one scripture expounding another, and the blessed Spirit making known the blessed Jesus. Christ is the Door. And what greater security has the church of God than that the Lord Jesus is between it and all its enemies? He is a door open for passage and communication. Here are plain directions how to come into the fold; we must come in by Jesus Christ as the Door. By faith in him as the great Mediator between God and man. Also, we have precious promises to those that observe this direction. Christ has all that care of his church, and every believer, which a good shepherd has of his flock; and he expects the church, and every believer, to wait on him, and to keep in his pasture.</body></html>
