(<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>). They asked it in the bitterness of scorn. He asserts that among the Gentiles--who are not of the Jewish fold--He already possesses sheep; just as He says to Paul concerning Corinth, "I have much people in this city" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-10.htm" title="For I am with you, and no man shall set on you to hurt you: for I have much people in this city.">Acts 18:10</a>). The Old Testament prophets had foretold this coming of the Gentiles, as <span class= "ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm" title="And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Micah 4:2</a>; and it is present to our Lord's mind here as the result of His laying down His life for the sheep. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-52.htm" title="And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.">John 11:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice.</span>--The bringing in of the Gentiles was in the Divine counsel part of the Messianic work which He must therefore needs do. It would result from His being lifted up that all men should be drawn unto Him, and would be accomplished in the mission-work of the Church. These scattered sheep shall hear His voice, for the conscience which knows the voice of God is the heritage of all men; they shall hear it, as the words seem to imply, while the sheep now in the fold refuse to follow it. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-11.htm" title="And I say to you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 8:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">There shall become one flock, and one shepherd.</span> The word here rendered "fold," is quite distinct from that which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1</a>, and in the earlier clause of this verse. It should be, beyond all doubt, rendered "flock"; but the reader may prove this for himself by comparing the only other passages where it is found in the New Testament--<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, All you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.">Matthew 26:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-8.htm" title="And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.">Luke 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-7.htm" title="Who goes a warfare any time at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof? or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?">1Corinthians 9:7</a> (twice). In each of these passages we have "flock"; but here our version has followed the Vulgate and the Great Bible in giving "fold," whereas both Tyndale and Coverdale had rightly given "flock." But even "flock" and "shepherd" fail to catch the expressiveness of the Greek, where the words are closely allied, and of nearly the same sound, "There shall be one <span class= "ital">poimne</span> and one <span class= "ital">poimen."</span> Luther's German can exactly render the verse. "Und Ich habe noch andere Schafe, die sind nicht aus diesem <span class= "ital">Stalle.</span> Und dieselben muss Ich herfhren, und sie werden meine Stimme h�ren, und wird eine <span class= "ital">Herde</span> und ein <span class= "ital">Hirte</span> werden."<p>It is not uniformity which is promised, but unity. The distinction is not merely one of words, but upon it depends a wide and important truth. It is not unity of fold which is regarded as the future of the Church, but unity of flock. There will be many folds, in many nations, in many ages, in many climes. But for all Christians there will be one true Shepherd who layeth down His life for the sheep, and all these differing folds shall, through living unity with Him, make one vast flock.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">The continuity of the Shepherd-activity</span>, <span class="accented">notwithstanding the laying down of his life</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice.</span> "The other sheep," not of this fold, not sheltered by the theocracy, not needing the pasturage of such privileges - Gentiles they may be, earnest souls of many a name, denomination, and profession, are, while he <span class="accented">speaks</span>, and went before the formation of his Church, ' his own." "Other sheep I have." Though they have never as yet heard his voice, they are his. His relation with them is personal and direct and spiritual, not dictated or conditioned by "the fold." They will hear his voice. We in vain ask the question, "When?" He alone can answer it. Many a Cornelius in every nation is accepted by him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-35.htm">Acts 10:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-27.htm">Acts 17:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>). But the passage contemplates a wider application: "Them also I must bring, or lead, among my own." They are scattered abroad now, but eternal Love, by assuming Shepherd-wise relations with them, determines not to bring them to one place or enclosure - to express such a thought we should have had, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>) or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (Westcott) - but to bring them into personal relations with himself. <span class="cmt_word">They shall become one flock, one Shepherd</span>. The false English translation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, viz. "fold," should be specially noticed. If our Lord had meant to convey the idea of the rigid enclosure into which all the scattered sheep should be gathered, he would have used the word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> is, however, studiously chosen. The error has done grievous injury. There is no variation of the Greek text, or in the earliest versions. It came through the Vulgate <span class="accented">ovile</span> into Wickliffe's Version, and into many other European versions. The Old Latin Versions were correct, but Jerome led the way into the inaccurate translation. Tyndale perceived its true meaning, and Luther beautifully preserved the play upon the words. Coverdale, in his own Bible (1535), followed Tyndale; but in 1539, "the Great Bible" followed the Vulgate (Westcott). When naturalized, it sustained the false and growing pretension that outside the one "fold" of the visible Church the good Shepherd was not ready with his care and <span class="accented">love</span> (see for the only adequate translation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where the Authorized Version has correctly rendered it "flock"). Christ, on other occasions, carefully warned his disciples against such narrowness, and here he declares that the sheep, independently of the fold or folds, may yet form one great <span class="accented">flock</span>, under <span class="accented">one Shepherd</span>. When he described himself as the <span class="accented">Door</span>, he was, as we have seen, careful to speak of himself as "Door of the <span class="accented">sheep</span>," and not as the Door into the <span class="accented">fold</span>. He laid down his life in order to break down the partition between Jew and Gentile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>), between God and man, and between man and man. "In Christ Jesus there is neither Jew nor Greek, male nor female, bond nor free." There may be many folds. Different nations, ages, times, and seasons may cause variations in these; but there is but one flock under the watchful guardianship of one Shepherd. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were careless in their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Bad principles are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom he has chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted, and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity of our case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He was both the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life was his offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in the place and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from the punishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that his death should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down for his doctrine, but for his sheep.</body></html>
