In this and the following verse He advances from that defence to the ultimate test. Whether He is a blasphemer or not depends upon whether He represents God or not, and to prove this He appeals again to the works. Are they or are they not the works of the Father? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?">John 10:32</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - "I and the Father are one," and "I am the Son of God." These two mighty utterances are equivalent to the following: "I do the works of my Father." My works are his works, his works are mine. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." The recognition of the Divine is a sign of the regenerated mind, and a test of fitness for a place in Christ's flock (cf. "I know my sheep, and my sheep know me"). The Jews had not recognized the true reciprocal relation between the Father and Son. He had come out from God, and been sent from the Father to produce this impression, to make known the Father by his Sonship; and he had taken steps to convince even unbelieving men of the identity of his nature and Spirit with that of the Father. He is content to rest his claims upon their belief, on the character of his works. He is content to leave the question as to whether he be a blasphemer or one with the Father, a sinner of sinners or Son of God, on the evidence of his works - on the God-like, Father-like character of his entire ministry (cf. ver. 32; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17, 36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span> "If the evidence be insufficient, I acquit you of blame in not taking me at my word. My own words and Person and life <span class="accented">might</span> be enough for you; but if my works are not in perfect harmony with the best you know of the Father, believe me not." Christ's appeal to the reason of his hearers, to the sufficiency of the evidence he had given, would justify unbelief in case of a proved failure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:31-38 Christ's works of power and mercy proclaim him to be over all, God blessed for evermore, that all may know and believe He is in the Father, and the Father in Him. Whom the Father sends, he sanctifies. The holy God will reward, and therefore will employ, none but such as he makes holy. The Father was in the Son, so that by Divine power he wrought his miracles; the Son was so in the Father, that he knew the whole of His mind. This we cannot by searching find out to perfection, but we may know and believe these declarations of Christ.</body></html>
