We are not, therefore, to regard "the porter" as an essential part of the allegory (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-5.htm" title="And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.">John 10:5</a>), nor need we trouble ourselves with the various expositions which have been given of it. At the same time, we should not forget that the thought is one which impressed itself on the mind of St. Paul. At Ephesus "a great and effectual door was opened unto him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm" title="For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.">1Corinthians 16:9</a>); "when he came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel a door was opened unto him of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>); the Colossians are exhorted to pray that "a door of the word (the gospel) may be opened, to speak the mystery of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>); at the close of the first missionary journey he and Barnabas told how "God had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-27.htm" title="And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.">Acts 14:27</a>). We have St. Paul's authority, therefore, for understanding by the "door-keeper," if we are to interpret it here, the Holy Spirit, whose special work it is to determine who are shepherds and sheep, and to call each to the work and position given to him by God. We must be careful to note, with this interpretation, that St. Paul gives divine titles to Him who thus opens the door, lest, from the humble position of the porter in the material fold, we should be led to unworthy thoughts of Him who is "neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding."<p><span class= "bld">And the sheep hear his voice.</span>--The reference is here to the whole of the sheep in the fold; they are all roused as they hear a shepherd's cry, which is the signal for their being led forth to the pastures.<p><span class= "bld">And he calleth his own sheep by name,</span> <span class= "bld">and leadeth them out.</span>--Now the sheep of the shepherd's own flock are thought of. They are singled out from the rest, each one by its own name. A mountain shepherd in our own country, and even a shepherd's dog, will know a single sheep among hundreds from other flocks, and there is nothing more strange in the sheep being trained to know its own name and its shepherd's voice. We have to think, also, of a much closer relationship between the owner and his sheep, which were almost part of his family, than any with which we are familiar. All animals learn to know those who love and protect them, and the Eastern shepherd was as much with his sheep as we are with the domestic animals. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-34.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:">1Samuel 17:34-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-3.htm" title="But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.">2Samuel 12:3</a>.) The practice was not unknown in the West, for Aristotle tells us that "in each flock they train the bell-wether to lead the way, whenever he is called by name by the shepherd" (<span class= "ital">History of Animals, </span>vi. 19); and Theocritus has handed down to us the names by which the Shepherd Lacon addressed three of his flock:--<p>"Ho, Curly-horn; Ho, Swift-foot, leave the tree,<p>And pasture eastward where ye Baldhead see."<p><span class= "ital">Idyll.</span> v. 102, 3.<p>(3) The reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-3.htm" title="Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.">Luke 10:3</a> to the wolves among whom they would be as lambs, throws light upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm" title="But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.">John 10:12</a>. He who would lay down His life for them would expose them to the wolves because He as the Good Shepherd would save them from <span class= "ital">the</span> wolf.<p><span class= "bld">And it was at Jerusalem.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And the Feast of the Dedication was being held at Jerusalem.--</span>Although St. John gives no hint that our Lord had left the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, this specific mention of the city implies a return from a distance, for the words would be out of place if He had continued there during the interval since <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-21.htm" title="Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?">John 10:21</a>. They cannot be restricted to the feast, which was not confined to Jerusalem, but was universally observed by the Jews.<p>The reference in the margin warns us against the error of understanding "the Feast of the Dedication" as a feast in honour of the dedication of Solomon's or Zerubbabel's temple. We know of no annual festival connected with these dedications, and the statement that this feast was "in the winter" makes it almost certain that it was the feast instituted, B.C. 164, by Judas Maccabaeus, in commemoration of the cleansing of the Temple after its profanation by Antiochus Epiphanes (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-52.htm" title="Now on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, which is called the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and eighth year, they rose up betimes in the morning,">1 Maccabees 4:52-59</a>). It extended over eight days, beginning on the 25th of the month Kisleu, which answers to parts of our November and December. It is still called "Chanuca," the Dedication, while St. John's Greek name for it, which was adopted by the Vulgate (<span class= "ital">Enc?nia</span>)<span class= "ital">, is</span> familiar to English ears in connection with another commemoration. In this, as in other rejoicings, illumination was a prominent feature, and it was sometimes called the "Feast of Lights." The Temple and private houses were illuminated, and it was customary in the houses of the more wealthy and pious Jews to have a light for each member of the family, increasing by an additional light for each evening of the feast. The illumination has been sometimes traced to the discovery in the temple by the Maccabees of a vial of oil, sealed with the high priest's ring. This, it is said, was sufficient for the lamps for one evening only, but was miraculously multiplied so as to suffice for eight evenings, which was therefore devoted to annual illuminations in remembrance of this gift of God (<span class= "ital">Talmud,</span> Shabbath 216).<p><span class= "bld">And it was winter.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">It was winter.</span> These words should then be connected with the following verse. Our division breaks the sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To him the porter openeth</span>. The doorkeeper of the fold has been variously interpreted. Bengel and Hengstenberg say, "God himself" is meant; Stier, Alford, and Lange, "the Holy Spirit;" against which interpretations may be urged the subordinate position assigned to the "porter," as compared with the shepherds themselves. Lampe and Godet think that "John the Baptist" was intended; while Meyer and De Wette say that it is one of those elements of the parable which is dropped out of our Lord's own exposition for which we need not seek any special application. Westcott thinks it must vary with the special sense attributed to "sheep" and "shepherd," and float we must think of it as "the Spirit working through his appointed ministers in each case." The "doorkeeper," if Christ be himself the "Door," is the keeper of that door - the agency, the ministry, the ordinances by which the excellences and power of Christ were or are manifested. We are reminded of subsequent use of the imagery in Paul's Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>); but the full meaning of the phrase is only suggested, and we had better wait for Christ's interpretation of some parts of this allegory. The context provides a specific filling out, first of one part of the imagery, and secondly of another part of it. The two interpretations are not to be forced at one and the same time upon the parable. Our Lord continues: <span class="cmt_word">And the sheep hear his</span> <span class="cmt_word">voice</span>. When a shepherd approaches the door to fetch the folded sheep which belong to him, the porter opens that door for him <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a true shepherd who has at heart the interests of the sheep and of their supreme Owner, finds the way made ready for him. In the fold are many flocks. All the sheep give heed to his voice. <span class="cmt_word">He calleth</span> <span class="cmt_word">his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</span> They know a shepherd calls, and then that shepherd addresses his own sheep by name, and he leads these forth into the pasture. Even in our own pastures the shepherds know each sheep by name. Aristotle ('Hist. Anim.,' 6:19) tells us the bell-wether knew his name, and obeyed his shepherd. Archdeacon Watkins gives a quotation from Theocritus' 'Idylls,' charmingly illustrating the habit. The shepherd, by the mere call to his own sheep, would separate them from these which did not belong to him, and lead them forth to their pasture in the wilderness. This method of Oriental life illustrates the function of all true shepherds of men. It has had many partial fulfillments in the history of the Church and of the world. Daring the period of the old theocratic dispensation, many "thieves and robbers" made havoc of the flock; still there were prophetic and kingly men who, sent by God, found their way to the heart of Israel; many came to know that a prophet had been among them, and they followed him. It is equally true now, though all the external conditions are changed. The full application of this part of the allegory is only seen when "the good Shepherd" seeketh his sheep; but the meaning of the first picture is obscured by hurrying on to the enlarged and double exposition which Christ gave of the two parts of his own parable, and much is lost by endeavoring to force into a primary exposition of vers. 1-6 the features borrowed from a twofold interpretation of the separate ideas suggested by the composite image. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Here is a parable or similitude, taken from the customs of the East, in the management of sheep. Men, as creatures depending on their Creator, are called the sheep of his pasture. The church of God in the world is as a sheep-fold, exposed to deceivers and persecutors. The great Shepherd of the sheep knows all that are his, guards them by his providence, guides them by his Spirit and word, and goes before them, as the Eastern shepherds went before their sheep, to set them in the way of his steps. Ministers must serve the sheep in their spiritual concerns. The Spirit of Christ will set before them an open door. The sheep of Christ will observe their Shepherd, and be cautious and shy of strangers, who would draw them from faith in him to fancies about him.</body></html>
