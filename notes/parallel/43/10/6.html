The word <span class= "ital">paroimia</span> occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.">John 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-29.htm" title="His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.">John 16:29</a>, and once besides in the New Testament; this is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-22.htm" title="But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.">2Peter 2:22</a> ("according to the true proverb"), in a quotation from the Greek version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-11.htm" title="As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.">Proverbs 26:11</a>, where the Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">m?shal.</span> (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-3.htm" title="And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;">Matthew 13:3</a>, and Trench <span class= "ital">On the Parables,</span> pp. 8-10.) The discourse of this chapter differs from the true parable, which is a story in which the outer facts are kept wholly distinct from the ideal truths that are to be taught; whereas here the form and the idea interpenetrate each other at every point. It is so in the other so-called "parable" in this Gospel (John 15). Strictly speaking, neither the "Good Shepherd" nor the "True Vine" is a parable. Both are "allegories," or rather, they are, as there is every reason to think, allegorical interpretations of actual events in the material world, which are thus made the vehicle of spiritual truths. It will follow from this that the interpretation of every point in the history of the material facts (<span class= "ital">e.g., "</span>the porter" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3</a>) is not always to be pressed. In the parable the story is made to express the spiritual truth, and with greater or lesser fulness every point in it may have its spiritual counterpart. The outer facts which are allegorised exist independently of the spiritual truth. The fact that they express it at some central points is all that is necessary for the allegory, and greater caution should attend the use of any addition to the interpretation which is given.<p><span class= "bld">But they understood not what things they were . . .</span>--They of course understood the outer facts, then passing before their eyes, or, in any case, well known to them. What they did not understand was the spiritual truths underlying these phenomena. They must have known His words had some spiritual meaning. They were accustomed to every form of allegorical teaching, and they could not have thought that He was simply describing to them the everyday events of the shepherd's life. But they who think that they see (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you should have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.">John 9:41</a>) are spiritually blind, and cannot understand the elements of divine truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This parable spake Jesus unto them</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs only in this place and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-25.htm">John 16:25-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>. It is the LXX. rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> proverb, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>, a similitude or didactic saying. The Greek word means any speech (<span class="accented">ethos</span>) deviating (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) from the common way (Lange). It may deviate by its sententious or parabolical form, which conceals under a closed metaphor a variety of meanings. <span class="cmt_word">But they,</span> the Pharisees, who were confident of their own position, and gloried in their influence over men, and whose moral nature was steeled and armed to resist even a possible reference to themselves as "thieves," or "robbers," or "aliens," and who would not admit any of Christ's claims to their own disparagement, <span class="cmt_word">understood not what things they were which he was saying to them.</span> The blind man had heard Ms voice, obeyed, found healing, advanced step by step from a bare knowledge of "a man Jesus" to a confession of him as one empowered by God; to a belief that he was a "Prophet," able to relax Mosaic Law; and finally to a ready acknowledgment that he was the Son of God. The Pharisees were conscious of neither need, nor blindness, nor desire of salvation, nor of the Shepherd's care or grace. They will not go to him for life. They can make nothing of his enigmatic words. They take counsel against him. Their misconception contrasts strongly with the susceptibility of the broken-hearted penitents. So far the parable or proverb corresponds with the parables of the kingdom in the synoptic Gospels, and is open to many interpretations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-9 Many who hear the word of Christ, do not understand it, because they will not. But we shall find one scripture expounding another, and the blessed Spirit making known the blessed Jesus. Christ is the Door. And what greater security has the church of God than that the Lord Jesus is between it and all its enemies? He is a door open for passage and communication. Here are plain directions how to come into the fold; we must come in by Jesus Christ as the Door. By faith in him as the great Mediator between God and man. Also, we have precious promises to those that observe this direction. Christ has all that care of his church, and every believer, which a good shepherd has of his flock; and he expects the church, and every believer, to wait on him, and to keep in his pasture.</body></html>
