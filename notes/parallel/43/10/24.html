The words exactly express what was probably the real state of fluctuation in which many of these Jews then were. They do not in the true sense "believe" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-25.htm" title="Jesus answered them, I told you, and you believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.">John 10:25-26</a>), and they soon pass to the other extreme of seeking to stone Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31</a>); but in many of them the last miracle, and the words accompanying it, had left a conviction that He was more than human, and not possessed by a demon. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-21.htm" title="Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?">John 10:21</a>.) Two months have passed away, not, we may believe, without many an earnest thought and much anxious weighing of evidence concerning Him. And now the Feast of Dedication has come, and what thoughts have come with it? It is the Feast of Lights, and He had declared Himself the Light of the world. It is the Feast of Freedom, telling how the Maccabees had freed their nation from the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, and He has declared that "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-36.htm" title="If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.">John 8:36</a>). It is the feast which commemorates the cleansing of the Temple, and His first public appearance in the Temple was to cleanse it and claim it as His Father's house. May there not be, then, a close connection between the statement that "it was the Feast of the Dedication," and the question, "How long dost thou excite our souls?" Was He, the question would seem to ask, really the Messiah or not? though by the Messiah they mean only a temporal prince. Was He, like the Judas of whom they were thinking, raised up as a deliverer from the Roman power, to give them the freedom which had long been the national dream?<p><span class= "bld">If thou be the Christ, tell us.</span>--Comp.
