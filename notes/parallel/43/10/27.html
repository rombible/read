One member of each pair refers to the act or state of the sheep; and the other to the act or gift of the Shepherd. The pairs proceed in a climax from the first response of the conscience which recognises the divine voice to the eternal home which is in the Father's presence.<p>(1)"My sheep hear My voice," . . "and I know them;"<p>(2)"And they follow Me"<span class= "ital"> .</span> . "and I give unto them eternal life;"<p>(3)"And they shall never perish" . . . "neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand."<p>By reading successively the clauses placed on the left side of the page, we trace the progress of the human act and state; by reading, in the same way, the clauses on the right side of the page, we trace the progress of the divine gift; by reading each pair in the order of the text, we see how at each stage the gift is proportioned to the faculty which can receive it.<p>The earlier clauses are familiar to us from the preceding discourse, but some expressions will need a word of explanation.<p><span class= "bld">Eternal life.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm" title="The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.">John 10:10</a>, where the word "eternal" is added in some readings. Here the verb is in the present, "I give (am now giving) them." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-15.htm" title="That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.">John 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-47.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.">John 6:47</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> We cannot be too careful to observe that our Lord's thoughts of "eternal life" is never of the future only. It is a development, rather than a simply future existence. We shall live eternally, because we now live spiritually in communion with the Spirit who is Eternal.<p><span class= "bld">And they shall never perish.</span>--Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.">John 8:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25-26</a>. The negative is in the strongest form--"They shall by no means perish for ever."<p><span class= "bld">Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</span>--Better (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.">John 10:18</a>), <span class= "ital">and none shall pluck them</span> . . . The words should not be limited by the insertion of the word man. They are to be taken as including every spiritual foe; all thieves and robbers that would break into the fold; all wolves that would rend the flock; the adversary who "as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour." (Comp. especially for the full thought of no separation from Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38-39</a>.) The words "out of my hand" express alike the strength which protects, and guidance which leads, and comfort which cherishes. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>.) Out of this hand none shall pluck. Yet we are to bear in mind that the sheep itself may wander from the shepherd's care, and that all the fulness of these promises depends upon the human will, which is included in the first clause, "My sheep hear my voice . . . and they follow me."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-30.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Christ's claim to equality of power and essence</span>, <span class="accented">and similarity of gracious operation with the Father</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any one pluck them out of my hand.</span> Commentators have differed as to the arrangement of these two verses - whether the six assertions should be regarded as two triplets, in the first of which <span class="accented">the sheep</span> of Christ are made prominent, and in the latter of which <span class="accented">the Shepherd</span>; thus - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(l)</span> <span class="accented">The sheep -</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"My sheep hear my voice" (their receptivity). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"And I know them" (the Lord's response to their faith). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"And they follow me" (their active obedience). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The Shepherd -</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"I give them eternal life" (involving freedom from peril and death). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"They shall not perish forever." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"No one (not man or devil, wolf or hireling) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>shall pluck them out of my hand." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is not so satisfactory as the arrangement which puts this weighty saying into three couplets instead of two triplets; in which the sheep are the prominent theme of each proposition. The three couplets display the climacteric character of the wondrous rhythm and interchange of emotion between the Divine Shepherd and the sheep- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"<span class="accented">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them"</span> = mutual recognition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"<span class="accented">They follow me, and I give them eternal life"</span> = reciprocal activity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"<span class="accented">They shall not perish forever, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand"</span> = an authoritative assurance, and its pledge or justification. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christ's knowledge of the sheep corresponds with their recognition of his supreme claims; theft active trust is rewarded by his greatest gift; their indefeasible birthright is guaranteed by his limitless authority and power to protect them. It would be gross perversion of the passage to urge this indefeasible birthright on the ground of a few occasional flashes of conscious assurance and without any recognition of all the terms of the relation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:22-30 All who have any thing to say to Christ, may find him in the temple. Christ would make us to believe; we make ourselves doubt. The Jews understood his meaning, but could not form his words into a full charge against him. He described the gracious disposition and happy state of his sheep; they heard and believed his word, followed him as his faithful disciples, and none of them should perish; for the Son and the Father were one. Thus he was able to defend his sheep against all their enemies, which proves that he claimed Divine power and perfection equally with the Father.</body></html>
