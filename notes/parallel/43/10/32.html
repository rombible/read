Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14</a>. We have no better word in English; but "excellent," "distinguished," approach the sense. It is not the nature of the works as beneficent that is made prominent, but their moral excellence. They are works from the Father manifested in the visible world by the Son. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19-20</a>.) Jesus speaks of "many" such works. John has recorded but few, but he has given hints that many more were done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm" title="The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.">John 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a>), and he afterwards expressly asserts this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:">John 20:30</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For which of those works do ye stone me?</span>--Again there is a fulness of meaning in the Greek which it is difficult to convey in translation. The word rendered "which" marks, not simple distinction, but quality. (Comp. "What kind of commandment," Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-36.htm" title="Master, which is the great commandment in the law?">Matthew 22:36</a>.) "What is the character," our Lord would ask, "of that one of these works on account of which ye are about to stone Me?" If they had thought out this question they must have been led to see that the quality of the works proved that they were from God, and that therefore He by whom they had been wrought, was also from God. This thought of the quality of the works had been in the minds of some of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>). Its true issue would have been to worship Him as God; they are preparing to stone Him as a blasphemer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered them, Many good</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">works have I shown you from the</span> (<span class="cmt_word">my</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Father</span>. The works of Christ were lovely and radiant with Divine beneficence; they were revelations of the Father. "I showed you many of them," says he; "I gave you signs thus of the intimate relation between the whole of the self-revelation I am making and the Father" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-65.htm">John 6:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-42.htm">John 8:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For which work of these (works) are ye stoning me?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. preparing by your gesture to carry this into effect. By these words, uttered with smiting irony and terrific though quiet indignation, <span class="accented">Jesus answered</span> their threat. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:31-38 Christ's works of power and mercy proclaim him to be over all, God blessed for evermore, that all may know and believe He is in the Father, and the Father in Him. Whom the Father sends, he sanctifies. The holy God will reward, and therefore will employ, none but such as he makes holy. The Father was in the Son, so that by Divine power he wrought his miracles; the Son was so in the Father, that he knew the whole of His mind. This we cannot by searching find out to perfection, but we may know and believe these declarations of Christ.</body></html>
