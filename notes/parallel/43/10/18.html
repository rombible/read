Apparently a primary word; a 'father'.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">No man taketh it from me.</span>--It is better to leave the words in the greater width of the Greek, <span class= "ital">No one taketh it from Me,</span> for it may be, indeed, that even the Father is included in the thought. The laying down of the life is absolutely self-determined, and therefore it is the reason of the Father's love. Up to the very last moments of life He lays stress on the perfectly voluntary nature of His death. "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit; and having said thus, He gave up the ghost." (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</span>--The words apply also to the human nature of our Lord, and the "power" spoken of is the authority derived from the Father. It is of His own will that He lays down His life and takes it again; but this, as the whole of the life of the Son, is in moral subordination to the Father. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-10.htm" title="Then said Pilate to him, Speak you not to me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?">John 19:10</a>.) Hence it is that He speaks of taking His life again, while the general language of the New Testament speaks of His being raised by the Father. The taking again was under the Father's authority, and was therefore itself the Father's gift. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">This commandment have I received of my Father.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">did I receive;</span> pointing, probably, to the commission at the time of the Incarnation. He has asserted in fullest terms the entirely voluntary nature of His one sacrifice. He repeats in fullest terms the voluntary subordination of Son to Father, which is based upon equality of nature. Not only was the authority by which He would die and rise again derived from the Father, but both these acts were included in the decree which gave to Him the Messianic work. We should be on our guard against the mistake which is often made of understanding this commandment of the laying down the life only; it clearly extends also to the taking it again.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No one taketh</span> <span class="cmt_word">it away from me, but I lay it down of myself.</span> Should the aorist be the true reading, then the whole of the Incarnation must have been regarded by the Lord as already accomplished, as a completed fact. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>, "no one" neither God, nor man, nor evil <span class="accented">spirit - taketh it</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my life, <span class="accented">away from me</span>, <span class="accented">from myself</span>, in the exercise of my sovereign will, in the full consciousness of spontaneity. I am <span class="accented">laying it down</span>, not in consequence of my impotence before the powers of darkness, but "from myself." This proceeding is in perfect harmony with the will of God the Father; but it is Christ's free act notwithstanding, and of all things the most worthy of the Father's love (cf. here <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>, which appears at first to be in contradiction with the statement of this verse; but the closing words of the verse rectify the impression; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>). Christ justifies his extraordinary claim to lay down and after his death (retaining then the full possession of his Personality), to reassume the life which for a while, in submission to the doom on human nature, he had resolved to sacrifice, he says, I have (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">right</span> - or, <span class="accented">power</span> and <span class="accented">authority</span> combined - <span class="cmt_word">to lay it down, and right to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.</span> I have power to do both these things. No other has ever put forth such a claim, and the discharge of it "from himself," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. spontaneously, is stated to be in consequence of an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, an appoint-merit, an ordinance, he had received from the Father. The Divine purpose was realized in his perfect freedom and his perfect and absolute fulfillment of the Father's will. The narrative of the agony in the garden, given by the synoptists, confirms the blending of his own freedom with the Divine order; but the language of this Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>), and Matthew 19:11), and the best researches into what is called "the physical cause of the death of Christ" (see Dr. Stroud's valuable work on that subject), all confirm the voluntary nature of our Lord's suffering and death. "To cover this incomparable privilege with a veil of humility, he thought good to call it a command. The Father's mandate was, Thou shalt die or not die, thou shalt rise again or <span class="accented">not</span> rise again, according to the free promptings of thy love" (Godet). It was, however, the Father's appointment that Christ should freely exercise this stupendous consequence of his perfect obedience. So that all the assurances that God raised him from the dead are confirmed by the mode in which he speaks of his Divine right. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were careless in their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Bad principles are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom he has chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted, and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity of our case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He was both the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life was his offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in the place and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from the punishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that his death should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down for his doctrine, but for his sheep.</body></html>
