Their action follows as an effect caused by His words. The word "again" reminds us that they had done this two months before, at the Feast of Tabernacles (8:59). The words for "took up" are not the same. There the sense is, "they lifted up stones," and we are told that Jesus hid Himself; here the meaning is, "they carried stones," there being none in the cloister where they were. During this process their first burst of anger expended itself, and our Lord further disarms it with a question.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-39.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Resented and challenged</span>, <span class="accented">but vindicated by word and sign</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - That the Jews supposed him to speak of an essential unity is obvious from what follows. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews (then</span><span class="cmt_word">) took up</span> - should rather be <span class="accented">carried</span> or <span class="accented">bore</span> in their hands - <span class="cmt_word">stones again</span>, huge pieces of marble lying around in the public works then proceeding. There is an increase of malice over and above what was involved in simply lifting stones from the pavement (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>), and the alteration of the word is another hint of the eye-witness. The word "again" reminds the reader that this was a second and more desperate attack upon the life of Jesus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:31-38 Christ's works of power and mercy proclaim him to be over all, God blessed for evermore, that all may know and believe He is in the Father, and the Father in Him. Whom the Father sends, he sanctifies. The holy God will reward, and therefore will employ, none but such as he makes holy. The Father was in the Son, so that by Divine power he wrought his miracles; the Son was so in the Father, that he knew the whole of His mind. This we cannot by searching find out to perfection, but we may know and believe these declarations of Christ.</body></html>
