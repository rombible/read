They are not, however, without considerable authority, and the fact of their difficulty may have led to their omission. They are sometimes joined to the following verse, and some expositors accept this as their probable meaning; but although the preceding clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-26.htm" title="But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep, as I said to you.">John 10:26</a> was not actually spoken in the previous discourse, it was implied, and the reference is of a like kind to that of the Messiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-25.htm" title="Jesus answered them, I told you, and you believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.">John 10:25</a>. There is no real difficulty in the fact that He thus refers them to a discourse uttered two months before. In continuity of teaching from Him to them it immediately preceded, and at the commencement of this discourse He gathers up the thread of that which had gone before. On the other hand, the interval helps us to understand how He refers to a truth which was taught them, rather than to the actual words in which He taught it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - He gives the reason of their insensibility or lack of appreciation and faith: <span class="cmt_word">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep</span> (for similar construction, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-65.htm">John 6:65</a>).

In neither case does it appear entirely relevant, although the difficulties felt in either application may be reduced by supposing either one saying or the other to have been virtually embodied in the statements of the parables of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-18</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:22-30 All who have any thing to say to Christ, may find him in the temple. Christ would make us to believe; we make ourselves doubt. The Jews understood his meaning, but could not form his words into a full charge against him. He described the gracious disposition and happy state of his sheep; they heard and believed his word, followed him as his faithful disciples, and none of them should perish; for the Son and the Father were one. Thus he was able to defend his sheep against all their enemies, which proves that he claimed Divine power and perfection equally with the Father.</body></html>
