If we think that the whole discourse was suggested by a scene actually occurring (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1</a>), then the prominence of an actual shepherd passing before them would suggest the turn which it now takes.<p>The word "good" means that which is fair, and is in a physical sense that which is in its own nature excellent, and in a moral sense that which is beautiful and noble. St. John uses the word only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm" title="And said to him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.">John 2:10</a>, of the "good wine," and in this chapter here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-32.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?">John 10:32-33</a>. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-15.htm" title="But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.">Luke 8:15</a>.) The passage of the Old Testament referred to above has prepared our minds for this thought of Christ, especially Psalms 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/34-11.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a>. He is the Shepherd who is ideally good, fulfilling every thought of guidance, support, self-sacrifice that had ever gathered round the shepherd's name. No image of Christ has so deeply impressed itself upon the mind of the Church as this has. We find it in the earliest Christian literature, as in Tertullian (<span class= "ital">Works,</span> vol. i., p. 371, in Ante-Nicene Library), or Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Works,</span> vol. i., pp. 149, 462, A.N. Lib.). We find it in the very earliest efforts of Christian art, in painting, embroidery, and even statuary. (See Kugler's <span class= "ital">Handbook, Italian Schools,</span> Lady Eastlake's Trans., 4th Ed., pp. 5 and 6.) It comes to us naturally in our hymns and prayers. The pastoral staff is the fit emblem of the Bishop's work, and the Pastor is the name by which the humble way-side flock thinks of him who in Christ's name is appointed to be their guide.<p><span class= "bld">Giveth his life for the sheep.</span>--This was true of the actual shepherds, of whose devoted bravery many instances are told. A striking one is that of David himself who rescued the lamb of his father's flock from the mouth of the lion and the bear (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-34.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:">1Samuel 17:34-37</a>). That self-sacrifice that would lead the shepherd to risk his own life for that of his flock has its ideal fulfilment in Him who is the Good Shepherd, and will give His life for mankind. The word rendered "giveth is life," should be almost certainly <span class= "ital">layeth down His life.</span> They are found only in St. John's writings. The other passages are <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-15.htm" title="As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.">John 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-37.htm" title="Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.">John 13:37-38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-13.htm" title="Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.">John 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1John 3:16</a> (twice).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-21.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">The functions and responsibilities of the veritable Shepherd</span>, <span class="accented">and the relation of the Shepherd to the flock</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the good Shepherd</span>. The word here rendered "good" means more than the "true" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) or the" veritable" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); more than <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, good, in the sense of being morally excellent and inwardly fulfilling God's purpose that the sheep should be shepherded. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> suggests a "goodness" that is conspicuous, that shows and approves itself to the experience and observation of all. Thus the Lord fills up the meaning of the first parable by emphasizing another element in it. There may be many shepherds worthy of the name, but he alone justifies the designation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23</a>.). This imagery has inwrought itself into Christian literature and art. The earliest representations of Christ in the catacombs depict him as "the good Shepherd" (Tertullian, 'De Fuga.,' c. 11; Hermas, 'Sire.,' 6:2); the earliest hymns and latest minstrelsy of the Church dwell fondly on the image which portrays his individual watchfulness, his tender care, his self-sacrificing love. <span class="cmt_word">The good Shepherd layeth</span> <span class="cmt_word">down his life for the sheep</span>; not only does his work with his life in his hand, but he deliberately lays down his life and consciously divests himself of his life, and is doing it now. The Shepherd dies that the sheep may live (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>). Elsewhere Jesus says, "The Son of man gives his life a ransom for many" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>). The thought is very grand, and is a strange addition to the claim to be the Shepherd of Israel, and gives intense pathos to the language of our Lord to Simon Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>), "Shepherd my sheep." The further development of the parable shows that in the metaphor he regards his death as no disastrous termination of the Shepherd's function, but as an event in his career. Hence it is not just of Reuse ('Theol. Chretien,' 2.) to contend that our Lord does not here suggest a vicarious or propitiatory death on his part. This is a veritable death, which secures the life of the sheep, and does not arrest the Shepherd's care (see vers. 17, 18). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were careless in their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Bad principles are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom he has chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted, and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity of our case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He was both the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life was his offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in the place and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from the punishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that his death should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down for his doctrine, but for his sheep.</body></html>
