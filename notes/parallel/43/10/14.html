It is not simply that the sheep know the Shepherd's voice, but they partake of His nature, and the solemn form in which He expresses this union is in likening it to that between His Father and Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - The Lord resumes: <span class="cmt_word">I am the good Shepherd</span>. He now makes his discourse more explicit. He almost drops the allegory, and merely adopts the sacred metaphor. His self-revelation becomes more full of promise and suggestion for all time. He takes up one of the characteristics of the shepherd which discriminated him from "hireling," "thief," or "robber." <span class="cmt_word">And I know mine own, and my</span> <span class="cmt_word">own know me, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father.</span> This more accurate text, translation, and punctuation of the Revised Version brings into living comparison the mutual knowledge of Christ and his own sheep, with the mutual knowledge of Christ and the Father. Christ's personal knowledge of his people is that which comes into their religious consciousness. They know his knowledge of them. They know him to be what he is - to be their Lord God, as they realize his personal recognition and care. The one involves the other (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>). The particle of transition is more than a mere illustration (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> is more than <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> introduces not infrequently an explanation, sometimes a causal consideration, or an illustration which accounts for the previous statement; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21, 23</a>). The knowledge which the sheep have of the Shepherd corresponds with the Son's knowledge of the Father, and the Shepherd's knowledge of the sheep answers to the Father's knowledge of the Son; but more than this, the relation of the Son to the Father, thus expressed, is the real ground of the Divine intimacies between the sheep and the Shepherd (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-8.htm">John 17:8</a>). Then the Lord repeats and renews the solemn statement made at the commencement of the sentence, And I lay down my life for the sheep. Such knowledge of the peril of "his own" involves him in sacrifice. Whereas in ver. 11 this is attributed to the "good Shepherd," now he drops the first part of the figure, and says, "I am laying down my life." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were careless in their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Bad principles are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom he has chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted, and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity of our case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He was both the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life was his offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in the place and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from the punishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that his death should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down for his doctrine, but for his sheep.</body></html>
