In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;">Matthew 19:1</a> we have the fuller expression, "the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan," referring to the same locality. The whole of Judaea proper was Cis-Jordanic, and the "Judah upon Jordan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-34.htm" title="And then the coast turns westward to Aznothtabor, and goes out from there to Hukkok, and reaches to Zebulun on the south side, and reaches to Asher on the west side, and to Judah on Jordan toward the sun rise.">Joshua 19:34</a>) was the boundary "toward the sun-rising" of the tribe of Naphthali--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> it answered to what was afterwards known as Gaulonitis, and is now known as the <span class= "ital">Jolan.</span> Josephus [<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iii. 3) expressly enumerates Gaulonitis as belonging to Judaea in the time of our Lord. For the explanation of this spread of the name, which has always been a geographical crux, see von Raumer's argument in Dr. Caspari's summary (<span class= "ital">Chron. and Geogr., Introd.,</span> Eng. Trans., p. 90). We have to think, then, probably of Bethania or <span class= "ital">Tellanihje,</span> to the north of the Sea of Galilee, on the eastern side of the Jordan, as the place of our Lord's retirement. He had taught the Jews by divine words, and they had sought to stone Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm" title="Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the middle of them, and so passed by.">John 8:59</a>). He had appealed to divine works, and they had attempted to take Him by force (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-39.htm" title="Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,">John 10:39</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm" title="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.">John 7:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-32.htm" title="The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.">John 7:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-44.htm" title="And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.">John 7:44</a>). He sees in all this the darkness which foreshadows the night, and He retires from the city to visit it no more until the final Passover, when the night will be at hand.

He escaped, not because he was afraid to suffer, but because his hour was not come. And He who knew how to deliver himself, knows how to deliver the godly our of their temptations, and to make a way for them to escape. Persecutors may drive Christ and his gospel our of their own city or country, but they cannot drive him or it out of the world. When we know Christ by faith in our hearts, we find all that the Scripture saith of him is true.</body></html>
