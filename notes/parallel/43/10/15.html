But connecting the words with those of the previous verse, we have, "I am the Good Shepherd, and know <span class= "ital">those who are Mine, and those who are Mine know Me, even as the Father knoweth Me, and I know the Father."</span> This deeper sense of union between the human spirit and Himself, and the wondrous likening of it to the union of Himself and the Father, is present to His mind as the close of His work on earth draws near. We find it again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-20.htm" title="At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.">John 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-10.htm" title="If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.">John 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-8.htm" title="For I have given to them the words which you gave me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from you, and they have believed that you did send me.">John 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>. It is bound up with the thought of the love which lays down His own life for them. This is repeated here and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17-18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were careless in their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Bad principles are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom he has chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted, and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity of our case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He was both the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life was his offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in the place and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from the punishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that his death should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down for his doctrine, but for his sheep.</body></html>
