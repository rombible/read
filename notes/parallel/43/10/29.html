Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>. Here our version has rightly made no limiting addition to "all" (comp. last verse). In the width of the word, which extends to every creature and to every power, and even to the Son in His subordination to the Father, the Father is thought of as greater than all. Again the thought mounts with each succeeding sentence: (1) "None shall pluck them out of My hand;" (2) "They are My Father's gifts, and He is greater than all;" (3) "None shall pluck them out of My Father's hand."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - The last statement is sustained by a still loftier assumption. Before translating, it is necessary to notice the three readings of the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That of the T.R. and the Revisers' Text: <span class="accented">My Father who gave</span> (<span class="accented">them</span>) <span class="accented">to me is greater than all</span> the powers that can possibly be arrayed against them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, D, <span class="accented">With reference to that which my Father</span>, <span class="accented">One greater than all</span>, <span class="accented">gave me</span>, <span class="accented">and no one is able to pluck from the hand of the Father</span>. Meyer, however, translates this differently; he supposes the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to refer to the Father "a something greater, a greater potence." Westcott and Hort prefer the reading with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; and Westcott translates, <span class="accented">That which my Father has given me is greater than all</span>, and regards it as a reference to the sheep as a collective unity. The internal reasons compel Luthardt, Godet, and Lange to fall back on T.R., and surely the extraordinary strain of the meaning justifies them. Our Lord would sustain with even stronger assurance the safety of his sheep. The Father's gift to himself, the Father's own eternal love and power, the Divine omnipotence of the Lord God himself, is pledged to their security. "My hand" becomes "my Father's hand." He seems to say, "If you question my capacity, you need not question his power. Sacrilegious violence may apparently nail my hands to the cross; the sword may awake against Jehovah's Shepherd. But none can outwit, surprise, crucify, conquer, my Father, none can invalidate his care." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:22-30 All who have any thing to say to Christ, may find him in the temple. Christ would make us to believe; we make ourselves doubt. The Jews understood his meaning, but could not form his words into a full charge against him. He described the gracious disposition and happy state of his sheep; they heard and believed his word, followed him as his faithful disciples, and none of them should perish; for the Son and the Father were one. Thus he was able to defend his sheep against all their enemies, which proves that he claimed Divine power and perfection equally with the Father.</body></html>
