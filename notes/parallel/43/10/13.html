If we omit them this verse must be immediately connected with that which precedes, the last clause of which is a parenthesis--"But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth (and the wolf catcheth them, and <span class= "ital">maketh havoc</span>)<span class= "ital">, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep."</span> The sense is not affected by the omission, and the words were apparently added as a gloss to make the meaning clear. The thought of the hireling is repeated to express the nature of the man, and to strengthen the contrast with the Good Shepherd which immediately follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - (<span class="cmt_word">The hireling</span> <span class="cmt_word">fleeth) because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep</span>. He only cares for himself. He is no match for the wolf of temptation, or disease, or death, lie wants to reap the personal advantage of his temporary office, and, if his own interests are imperiled, he can leave them to any other hireling, or to the wolf. Melancholy picture this of much deserted duty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were careless in their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Bad principles are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom he has chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted, and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity of our case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He was both the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life was his offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in the place and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from the punishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that his death should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down for his doctrine, but for his sheep.</body></html>
