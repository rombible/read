Yet it is more than a re-statement. We have arrived at the thought that the Word was one in nature with God. From this higher point of view, the steps below us are more clearly seen. The Word was God; the eternal pre-existence and personality are included in the thought.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same</span> Logos whom the writer has just affirmed to have been God himself, <span class="cmt_word">was</span>, though it might seem at first reading to be incompatible with the first or third clause of the first verse, nevertheless in the <span class="cmt_word">beginning with God</span> - "in the beginning," and therefore, as we have seen, eternally in relation with God. The previous statements are thus stringently enforced, and, notwithstanding their tendency to diverge, are once more bound into a new, unified, and emphatic utterance. Thus the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of the following sentences is charged with the sublime fulness of meaning which is involved in the three utterances of ver. 1. The first clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> declared that the Logos preceded the origination of all things, was the eternal ground of the world; the second <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> asserted his unique personality, so that he stands over against the eternal God, in mutual communion with the Absolute and Eternal One; the third clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> maintains further that the Logos was not a second God, nor merely Divine (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) or God-like, nor is he described as proceeding out of or from God (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), nor is he to be called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "the God absolute," as opposed to all his manifestations; but the Logos is said to be <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">God"</span> - <span class="accented">God</span> in his nature and being. This second verse reasserts the eternal <span class="accented">relation</span> of such a personality "with God," and prepares the way for the statements of the following verses. The unity of the Logos and Theos might easily be supposed to reduce the distinction between them to subjective relations. The second verse emphasizes the objective validity of the relation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 The plainest reason why the Son of God is called the Word, seems to be, that as our words explain our minds to others, so was the Son of God sent in order to reveal his Father's mind to the world. What the evangelist says of Christ proves that he is God. He asserts, His existence in the beginning; His coexistence with the Father. The Word was with God. All things were made by him, and not as an instrument. Without him was not any thing made that was made, from the highest angel to the meanest worm. This shows how well qualified he was for the work of our redemption and salvation. The light of reason, as well as the life of sense, is derived from him, and depends upon him. This eternal Word, this true Light shines, but the darkness comprehends it not. Let us pray without ceasing, that our eyes may be opened to behold this Light, that we may walk in it; and thus be made wise unto salvation, by faith in Jesus Christ.</body></html>
