Forty days had passed since they met before, and since John knew at the baptism that Jesus was the Messiah. These days were for the One a period of loneliness, temptation, and victory. They must have been for the other a time of quickened energy, wondering thought, and earnest study of what the prophets foretold the Messianic advent should be. Prominent among those prophecies which every Rabbi of that day interpreted of the Messiah, was <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>. We know that on the previous day the fortieth chapter is quoted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-23.htm" title="He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.">John 1:23</a>), and that this prophet is therefore in the speaker's thoughts. Side by side with these thoughts was the daily continuing tale of grief and sorrow and sin from those who came to be baptised. How often must there have came to the mind such words as, "He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows," "He was wounded for our transgressions," "He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter," "He bare the sin of many"! The Messiah, then, was the servant of Jehovah, the true Paschal Lamb of Isaiah's thought. While the heart burns with this living truth that all men needed, and that one heart only knew, that same Form is seen advancing. It bears indeed no halo of glory, but it bears marks of the agonising contest and yet the calm of accomplished victory. "He hath no form nor comeliness," "no beauty that we should desire Him." John looks at Him as He is coming, sees there living, walking in their midst, the bearer of the world's sin and sorrow; and utters words than which in depth and width of meaning none more full have ever come from human lips, "Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world."<p>The margin gives "beareth" as an alternative rendering for "taketh away," and this union exactly expresses the force of the original. He is ever taking away sin, but this He does by bearing the burden Himself. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm" title="And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.">1John 3:5</a>.) A reference to the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm" title="Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.">Isaiah 53:4</a>, above, fully establishes this. The Baptist probably used the very word of the prophet; but the Evangelist does not, in recording this for Greek readers, use the word of the LXX. as St. Peter does (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>, "bare our sin in His own body"), but are-translates, and chooses the wider word which includes both meanings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the following day.</span> Next after the day on which the Sanhedrin had heard from John the vindication of his own right to baptize in virtue of the commencement of the Messiah's ministry, which as yet was concealed from all eyes but his own. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> [<span class="cmt_word">John</span> ] <span class="cmt_word">seeth Jesus coming towards him,</span> within reach of observation (certainly not, as Ewald and others have imagined, to be baptized of him, for, as we have seen, the statements of ver. 33 exclude the possibility of such a purpose. The design of Jesus is not stated. The evangelist is here occupied with the testimony of the Baptist to Christ. Enough is said to provide the opportunity for the most wonderful and mysterious utterances of the forerunner. Behold (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> in the singular, although several persons are addressed, is not unusual; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-3.htm">John 11:3</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</span> We should observe, from the later context, that already John had perceived by special signs and Divine inspiration that Jesus was the Son of God, and the veritable Baptizer with the Holy Ghost; that he was before him in dignity, honour, and by pre-existence, although his earthly ministry had been delayed until after John's preparatory work had been done. John had felt that the "confession of sins" made by the guilty multitude, by generations of vipers, was needful, rational, imperative upon <span class="accented">them</span>; but that in the case of Jesus this confession was not only superfluous, but a kind of contradiction in terms. The Lord over whom the heavens had opened, and to whom the heavenly name had been given, fulfilling all righteousness by submitting to the baptism of repentance unto the remission of sins, was a profound perplexity to the Baptist. Strange was it that he who would have power to deal with the Holy Ghost even as John had been using water should have been called in any real sense to confess the sins of his own nature or life. John believed that Jesus was the Source of a fiery purity and purifying power, and that according to his own showing he had rejected all proposals which might bring Israel to his feet by assuming the <span class="accented">role</span> of their conquering Messiah. He had even treated these suggestions as temptations of the devil. Not to save his physical life from starvation would he use his miraculous energies for his own personal ends. Not to bring the whole Sanhedrin, priesthood, and temple guard, nay, even the Roman governor and court, to his feet, will he utter a word or wave a signal which they could misunderstand. His purpose was to identify himself, Son of God though he be, with the world - to "suffer all, that he might succour all." Because John knew that Jesus was so great he was brought to apprehend the veritable fact and central reality of the Lord's person and work. He saw by a Divine inspiration what Jesus was, and what he was about to do. The simple supposition that Jesus had made John the Baptist his confidant, on his return from the wilderness of temptation and victory, and that we owe the story of the temptation to the facts of Christ's experience which had been communicated to John, do more than any other supposition does to expound the standpoint of John's remarkable exclamation. A library of discussion and exposition has been produced by the words which John uttered on this occasion, and different writers have taken opposite views, which in their origin proceed from the same root. The early Greek interpreters were moving in a true direction when they looked to the celebrated oracle of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> as the primary signification of the great phrase, "The Lamb of God." The image used to portray the suffering Sin-bearer is the "Lamb brought silently to the slaughter," "a Sheep dumb before his shearers." Doubtless the first implication of this comparison arose from the prophet's conception of the patience, gentleness, and submission of the sublime but suffering "Servant of God;" but the fourth, fifth, sixth, and twelfth verses of that chapter are so charged with the sin bearing of the great Victim, the vicarious and propitiatory virtue of his agony unto death, that we cannot separate the one from the other. He who is led as a Lamb to the slaughter bears our sins and suffers pain for us, is wounded on account of our transgressions: "The Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all... it pleased the Lord to bruise him," etc. The Servant of God is God's Lamb, appointed and consecrated for the highest work of sacrificial suffering and death. The LXX. has certainly used the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, to bear, where John uses <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, to take away. Meyer suggests that in the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> the previous notion of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is involved and presupposed. The Hebrew formula, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, are variously translated by the LXX., but generally in the sense of bearing the consequences of personal guilt or the sin of another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-19.htm">Ezekiel 18:19</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a> it is distinctly used of the priestly expiation for sin to be effected by Eleazar. Here and elsewhere <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is translated in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, where God as the subject of the verb is described as lifting off sin from the transgressor and by bearing it himself - bearing it away. In several places the LXX. has gone further, translating the word, when God is the subject, by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, with the idea of forgiveness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-3.htm">Psalm 85:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-17.htm">Genesis 50:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-24.htm">Isaiah 33:24</a>). Hence the Baptist, in using the word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, had doubtless in his mind the large connotation of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> with the fundamental <span class="accented">prerequisite</span> of the taking away, which the oracle of Isaiah had suggested to him. John knew that the taking away of <span class="accented">sin</span> involved the twofold process: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the conference of a new spiritual life by the gift and grace of the Holy Spirit; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> such a removal of the consequences and shame and peril of sin as is involved by the bearing of <span class="accented">sins</span> in his own Divine personality. Thus he not only perceived from the accompaniments of the baptism that Jesus was the Son of God and the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, but that, being these, his meek submission and his triumphant repudiation of the temptations of the devil which were based upon the fact of his Divine sonship proved that he was the Divine sin-bearing Lamb of Isaiah's oracle. Many commentators have, however, seen a special reference to the Paschal lamb, with which Christ's work was, without hesitation, compared in later years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). There can be no doubt that the Passover lamb was a "sin offering" (Hengstenberg, 'Christ of the Old Testament,' vol. 4:351; Baur, 'Uber die Ursprung und Bedeutung des Passah-Fest,' quoted by Lucke, 1:404). It was God's sacrifice by pre-eminence, and the blood of the lamb was offered to God to make atonement, and it freed Israel from the curse that fell on the firstborn of Egypt. John, the son of a sacrificing priest, the Nazarite, the stern prophet of the wilderness, was familiar with all the ritual and the lessons of that solemn festival; and might look on the Son of God, selected for this sacrifice, as fulfilling in singular and unique fashion the function of the Passover Lamb for the whole world. But John would not be limited by the Paschal associations. Day by day lambs were presented before God as <span class="accented">burnt</span> offerings, as expressions of the desire of the offerers to accept absolutely the supreme will of God. Moreover, the lamb of the trespass offering was slain for atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-35.htm">Leviticus 4:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-11.htm">Leviticus 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-12.htm">Numbers 6:12</a>), either when physical defilement excluded the sufferer from temple worship, or when a Nazarite had lost the advantage of his vow by contact with the dead. Even the ceremonial of the great Day of Atonement, though other animal victims were used, suggested the same great thought of propitiatory suffering and death. These various forms of sacrificial worship must have been in the minds of <span class="accented">both Isaiah and John. They are the key to Isaiah's prophecy, and this in its turn is the basis of the cry of John.</span> The New Testament apostles and evangelists, whether accurate or not in their exegesis, did repeatedly take this oracle of Isaiah's as descriptive of the work of the Lord, and other early Christian writers treated the chapter as though it were a fragment of their contemporaneous evidence and exposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-28.htm">Acts 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16</a>; Clement, '1 Ep. ad Cor.,' 16.). John was standing further back, and on an Old Testament platform, but we have, in his knowledge of Isaiah's prophecies, and his familiarity with the sacrificial system of which that oracle foreshadowed the fulfilment, quite enough to account for the burning words in which he condensed the meaning of the ancient sacrifices, and saw them all transcended in the suffering Son of God. The author of 'Ecce Homo,' by identifying the "Lamb of God" with the imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, supposed that John saw, in the inward repose and spiritual joyfulness of Jesus, the power he would wield to take away the sin of the world. "He (John) was one of the dogs of the flock of Jehovah, Jesus was one of the Lambs of the good Shepherd." There is no hint whatever of these ideas in the psalm. This curiosity of exegesis has not secured any acceptance. Some difficulty has been felt in the fact that John should have made such progress in New Testament thought; but the experience through which John has passed during his contact with Jesus, the sentiment with which he found the Lord whom he sought coming to his baptism, the agony that he foresaw must follow the contact of such a One with the prejudices and sins of the people, above all, the mode in which our Lord was treating the current expectation of Messiah regarding its eagerly desired manifestations as temptations of the devil, flashed the whole of Isaiah's oracle into sudden splendour. He saw the Lamb already led to slaughter, and his blood upon the very door posts of every house; he saw him lifting, bearing, carrying away, the sin of the world, all impurity, transgression, and shame. His atoning sacrifice is already going on. The sins of mankind fall on the Holy One. He sees him pouring out his soul unto death, and making gentle intercession for his murderers; so in a glorious ecstasy he cries, "BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD!" (see my 'John the Baptist,' ch. 6. &sect; 2, pp. 369-386). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:29-36 John saw Jesus coming to him, and pointed him out as the Lamb of God. The paschal lamb, in the shedding and sprinkling of its blood, the roasting and eating of its flesh, and all the other circumstances of the ordinance, represented the salvation of sinners by faith in Christ. And the lambs sacrificed every morning and evening, can only refer to Christ slain as a sacrifice to redeem us to God by his blood. John came as a preacher of repentance, yet he told his followers that they were to look for the pardon of their sins to Jesus only, and to his death. It agrees with God's glory to pardon all who depend on the atoning sacrifice of Christ. He takes away the sin of the world; purchases pardon for all that repent and believe the gospel. This encourages our faith; if Christ takes away the sin of the world, then why not my sin? He bore sin for us, and so bears it from us. God could have taken away sin, by taking away the sinner, as he took away the sin of the old world; but here is a way of doing away sin, yet sparing the sinner, by making his Son sin, that is, a sin-offering, for us. See Jesus taking away sin, and let that cause hatred of sin, and resolutions against it. Let us not hold that fast, which the Lamb of God came to take away. To confirm his testimony concerning Christ, John declares the appearance at his baptism, in which God himself bore witness to him. He saw and bare record that he is the Son of God. This is the end and object of John's testimony, that Jesus was the promised Messiah. John took every opportunity that offered to lead people to Christ.</body></html>
