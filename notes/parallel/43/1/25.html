It is not baptism, therefore, which is strange to the questioners, but the fact that he places Jews and even Pharisees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm" title="But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?">Matthew 3:7</a>) in an analogous position to that of proselytes, and makes them to pass through a rite which marks them out as impure, and needing to be cleansed before they enter "the kingdom of heaven." By what authority does he these things? They had interpreted such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25</a> ff. to mean that Baptism should be one of the marks of Messiah's work. None less than the Christ, or Elias, or "the prophet" could enact a rite like this. John is assuming their power, and yet is not one of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they asked him (put the question), and said to him, Why baptizest thou, then, if thou be</span> <span class="cmt_word">not</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Christ, not Elijah, not the prophet?</span> It would seem that, judging from such expressions as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25, 26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>, the Jews expected some renewal of ceremonial purification on a grand scale at the Messianic appearance, and John's repudiation of every personal rank, which could, according to their view, justify him called for some explanation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:19-28 John disowns himself to be the Christ, who was now expected and waited for. He came in the spirit and power of Elias, but he was not the person of Elias. John was not that Prophet whom Moses said the Lord would raise up to them of their brethren, like unto him. He was not such a prophet as they expected, who would rescue them from the Romans. He gave such an account of himself, as might excite and awaken them to hearken to him. He baptized the people with water as a profession of repentance, and as an outward sign of the spiritual blessings to be conferred on them by the Messiah, who was in the midst of them, though they knew him not, and to whom he was unworthy to render the meanest service.</body></html>
