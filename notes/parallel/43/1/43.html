They came and saw where he dwelled, and stayed with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.">John 1:39</a>). Philip is mentioned in the other Gospels only in the lists of the Twelve. The touches of character are all found in St. John. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-5.htm" title="When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he said to Philip, From where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?">John 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-21.htm" title="The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.">John 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Follow me.</span>--This command, so full of meaning, is never used in the Gospels except as spoken by our Lord Himself, and is addressed to but one outside the circle of the Apostles, the rich young man whom Jesus loved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-21.htm" title="Jesus said to him, If you will be perfect, go and sell that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.">Matthew 19:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-21.htm" title="Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.">Mark 10:21</a>). In other parts of the New Testament it is used but once, in the words of the angel to Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-8.htm" title="And the angel said to him, Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals. And so he did. And he said to him, Cast your garment about you, and follow me.">Acts 12:8</a>). We cannot, therefore, limit the words to an invitation to accompany Him on that day's walk, though this is included, and in that walk from Bethania to Bethsaida there came the revelation which made the "Follow Me" a power binding for the whole of life. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-22.htm" title="But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.">Matthew 8:22</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43, 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the fourth day after the deputation from the Sanhedrin - <span class="cmt_word">he willed</span> - or was minded - <span class="cmt_word">to go forth into Galilee</span>, to commence his homeward journey. Whether this implies an actual beginning of his route, or suggests, before any step was taken in that direction, that the following incidents occurred, cannot be determined, though commentators take opposite sides, as though something important depended upon it. The former supposition is, however, in keeping with the considerable distance, on any hypothesis of the site of Bethany, between it and Cana. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> (the Lord himself "finds;" the two earliest disciples had sought and found him) <span class="cmt_word">findeth Philip</span>; very probably on the route from the scene of John's baptism to the Bethsaida on the western shore of the Lake of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus saith to him, Follow me;</span> become one of my <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. The arguments, the reasons, which weighed with him are not given at first, but we find that he soon learned the same great lesson as that which the other disciples had acquired, and he clothes them in memorable words. <span class="cmt_word">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> This is a remark of the evangelist, who did not consider it necessary to say from what city or neighbourhood he had himself issued. This town has utterly perished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20</a>), although some travellers (Robinson, 3:359; Wilson and Warren) believe that indications were found north of <span class="accented">Khan Minyeh</span>, and others have identified it with <span class="accented">Tell-Hum.</span> Some writers ('Picturesque Palestine,' vol. 2:74, 81, etc.) discover it in <span class="accented">Ain et</span> <span class="accented">Tabighah</span>, where some remains of a fountain reservoir and other buildings are found. It was identified by Thomson with <span class="accented">Abu-Zany</span>, on the west of the entrance of Jordan into the lake. The two pairs of brothers must have been familiar with Philip. Some interesting hints of character are attainable from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5</a>, in which an incident occurs where Philip revealed a practical wisdom and confident purpose, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21, 22</a>, where Andrew and Philip are made the confidants of the Greeks, and Philip is the one who seems able and willing to introduce them to Jesus. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm">John 14:8</a> Philip uttered one of the great longings of the human heart - a passionate desire to solve all mysteries, by the vision of the Father; but he lets out the fact that be had not seen all that he might have seen and known in Jesus himself. Subsequent history shows that Philip was one of the "great lights of Asia," and was held in the highest esteem (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 3:31). He must not be confounded with Philip the evangelist, whose daughters prophesied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:43-51 See the nature of true Christianity, it is following Jesus; devoting ourselves to him, and treading in his steps. Observe the objection Nathanael made. All who desire to profit by the word of God, must beware of prejudices against places, or denominations of men. They should examine for themselves, and they will sometimes find good where they looked for none. Many people are kept from the ways of religion by the unreasonable prejudices they conceive. The best way to remove false notions of religion, is to make trial of it. In Nathanael there was no guile. His profession was not hypocritical. He was not a dissembler, nor dishonest; he was a sound character, a really upright, godly man. Christ knows what men are indeed. Does He know us? Let us desire to know him. Let us seek and pray to be Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile; truly Christians, approved of Christ himself. Some things weak, imperfect, and sinful, are found in all, but hypocrisy belongs not to a believer's character. Jesus witnessed what passed when Nathanael was under the fig-tree. Probably he was then in fervent prayer, seeking direction as to the Hope and Consolation of Israel, where no human eye observed him. This showed him that our Lord knew the secrets of his heart. Through Christ we commune with, and benefit by the holy angels; and things in heaven and things on earth are reconciled and united together.</body></html>
