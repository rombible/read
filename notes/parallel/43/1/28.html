In support of this the etymology of Bethabara (= "ford-house") is compared with a possible meaning of Bethany (= "ship-house"), and the two are regarded as popular names of some well-known ford, one of which gradually ceased to be known as the name of this place, because it became appropriated as a name of the Bethany made prominent in the closing scenes of our Lord's life. On the other hand, it is believed that this argument from etymology is at least precarious; that ignorance of the place after three hundred years--and these years of war and unsettlement--is not unnatural; that the tradition in favour of Bethabara, which was then a favourite place for baptism, is one likely to have grown with this fact; and that we are not justified in adopting the critical decision of Origen, who rejected the almost unanimous evidence of MSS. in favour of this tradition at second hand. We are, moreover, ignorant of the site of Bethabara, and the identification with either Beth-barah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm" title="And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan.">Judges 7:24</a>), or Beth-nimrah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-36.htm" title="And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.">Numbers 32:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm" title="And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.">Joshua 13:27</a>), which in some readings of the LXX. had taken the forms <span class= "ital">Bethabra</span> and <span class= "ital">Betharaba,</span> gives a position much too far to the south, for the writer is clearly speaking of a place within easy approach of Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm" title="The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.">John 1:43</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-1.htm" title="And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:">John 2:1</a>), and he is careful to note the succession of days and even hours. It is not inconsistent with this that the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm" title="Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,">Matthew 3:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-5.htm" title="And there went out to him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.">Mark 1:5</a> seems to require a place of easy access from Jerusalem, for the positions are not necessarily the same, and the account there is of a general impression, while here we have the minute details of an eye-witness. Himself a disciple of John, he remembers the place where he was then dwelling and baptising, and he knows that this Bethany is "beyond Jordan," just as he knows that the other is "the town of Mary and her sister Martha" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-1.htm" title="Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.">John 11:1</a>), and that it "was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-18.htm" title="Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:">John 11:18</a>). Dr. Caspari believes that a "Bethany" answering the demands of the context is to be found in the village <span class= "ital">Tellanije</span> or <span class= "ital">Tellanihje,</span> which is in the Iolan to the north of the Sea of Galilee (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-40.htm" title="And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed.">John 10:40</a>). It is near a ford of the Jordan, with several brooks intervening. The identity of name depends upon the frequent substitution by the Arabs of "Tell" (= "hill") for "Beth" (="house"), so that the present word represents Beth-anije, or Bethany. Dr. Caspari's statement is now accessible to the English reader. Few, perhaps, will fully accept the author's opinion, "With regard to the accuracy of our conclusion respecting the site, there can, therefore, be no doubt" (<span class= "ital">Chron. and Geogr., Introd.,</span> p. 93), but it is based upon a reading of which there can be no doubt, and is, at least, a probable interpretation.<p>We have in these verses also a note of time. John now knows the Messiah, though others do not. This inquiry of the legates from Jerusalem was, therefore,, after the baptism of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>), and if so, after the Temptation also. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.">Matthew 4:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was</span> <span class="cmt_word">baptizing</span>. The fact that John the Baptist, in the previous verses, recognizes the Messiah, and that in vers. 31-33 he declares that knowledge to have followed the baptism and the sign then given to him, makes it obvious that the baptism and the forty days of the temptation are now in the past. Every day is clearly marked from the day on which the deputation from the Sanhedrin approached him, till we find Jesus at Cana, on his way to Jerusalem. Consequently, the baptism of Christ, which was the occasion of the higher knowledge that John acquired concerning him, as well as the temptation, had been consummated. Of this last it would seem highly probable John had received, in subsequent conversation with the Lord, a full report. The Lord had passed through the fiery ordeal. He had accepted the position of the Servant of the Lord, who, in the way of privation, suffering, fierce antagonism from world, flesh, and devil, would win the crown of victory and prove himself to be the Life and Light of the world. This chronological hint appears to me to explain the sudden and surprising utterance of the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:19-28 John disowns himself to be the Christ, who was now expected and waited for. He came in the spirit and power of Elias, but he was not the person of Elias. John was not that Prophet whom Moses said the Lord would raise up to them of their brethren, like unto him. He was not such a prophet as they expected, who would rescue them from the Romans. He gave such an account of himself, as might excite and awaken them to hearken to him. He baptized the people with water as a profession of repentance, and as an outward sign of the spiritual blessings to be conferred on them by the Messiah, who was in the midst of them, though they knew him not, and to whom he was unworthy to render the meanest service.</body></html>
