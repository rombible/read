The first chapter of Genesis is still present to the mind, but a fuller meaning can now be given to its words. All things came into existence by means of the pre-existent Word, and of all the things that now exist none came into being apart from Him.<p><span class= "bld">All things.</span>--The words express in the grandeur of an unthinkable array of units what is expressed in totality by "the world" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a>. The completion of the thought by the negative statement of the opposite brings sharply before us the infinitely little in contrast with the infinitely great. Of all these units not one is by its vastness beyond, or by its insignificance beneath His creative will. For the relation of the Word to the Father in the work of creation, comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15-16</a>.<p>For the form of this verse, which is technically known as antithetic parallelism, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-20.htm" title="For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.">John 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-23.htm" title="That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.

The Logos is the organ or instrument by which everything, one by one, was made. Two other words are used in the New Testament to denote "creation" - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>, a word indicating the mind and act of the Creator; and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>, points generally to the thing made. The parts of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> indicate the progress of the work, the process of some creative order, the occurrence of some event in the evolution of Divine providence. This word does not by one solitary expression dogmatically convey the creative act, but the fact of the "becoming," from, it may be, the region of pure thought to that of existence, or from non-observation into prominence, or from an inchoate to a perfect development, or from nothing to something. The context must determine the fulness of its meaning. Occasionally, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, it is powerfully contrasted with existence: "Before Abraham was [had come into being] I am." The context here does not allow us to affirm that St. John repudiated the prior existence of the <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, stuff, of which <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> were made. He does not affirm nor deny such a prior existency or condition, but by referring the universe in all its parts and items to the <span class="accented">Logos</span>, he absolutely ignores the Platonic notion of eternal matter. He could scarcely be ignorant of the speculation as it entered into the Philonic interpretation and formed the basis of the Gnostic speculations which were beginning to infest the early Church. By giving, however, a Divine origin and instrument to the "becoming" of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, and strengthening his statement by the negative coassurance, he absolutely excludes the dualism of Philo and of Gnostic tendency. In asserting that the Logos is he or that through whom all things were made, the writer does not lower the dignity of the Logos by regarding him merely as the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Father, because the same preposition is used of the relation of the Father to the world or to his servants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Elsewhere St. Paul powerfully affirms the same application of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>) to Christ's part in the Creation, reserving for the One God, the Father, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>. <span class="accented">From</span> God and <span class="accented">by</span> or <span class="accented">through</span> God are all things, still "all things" derive their existence "through" the activity, the will, the thought, of the Logos. "The sphere contracts as the blessing enlarges [query, 'intensifies']: existence for everything; life for vegetable and animal world; light for men" (Plummer). The same idea is made more explicit by the negative form in which it is restated: <span class="cmt_word">and without him -</span> that is, independently of his cooperation and volition (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">not even</span> <span class="cmt_word">one thing came into being.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> could hardly be spoken of as "one thing," seeing, according to the theory, it was not a unit as opposed to a multiplicity, but the condition of all things. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> would drive harder against any recognition of the <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> than would the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>. There is not the faintest approach to any supposition on John's part of the existence of such a primeval entity or eternal reality. The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> gives the student of the text and of the meaning grave difficulty. From very early times the Alexandrine Fathers and numerous uncial manuscripts, and an immense group of quotations and versions, unquestionably close the sentence we have just considered with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>, and consider the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as the subject of the following clause, translating it either, <span class="accented">That which has come into being in him was life</span>; or, <span class="accented">that which has come into being was</span> (or <span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="accented">life in him</span> - for one manuscript, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, has rendered the text more grammatical by reading <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. This, adopting the supposed early punctuation, Tregelles and Westcott and Hort have introduced into the text; but R.T. has coincided with T.R. Dr. Westcott has an elaborate note affirming the deep thought involved in the "ancient punctuation," to the effect that the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> refers, not merely to the original creation, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, but to the continued existence of that which has come into being. Of this, it is said, it derives its life, has its life in the Logos, and that this idea is expressed in a profounder way than by saying <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>; that it <span class="accented">was life</span> (before it was called into being, or became) <span class="accented">in him.</span> This profound and mysterious statement is affirmed by Dr. Moulton and Dr. Westcott to find different but clear expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, "Thou art worthy, our Lord and our God, to receive glory, etc.; for thou didst create all things, and for thy pleasure they were [<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, the reading preferred by Tisehendorf (8th edit.) and Westcott and Herr, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, 'they are'] and were created." Dr. Westcott thinks that "life" here represents "the Divine element in creation, that in virtue of which things 'are' each according to the fulness of its being." What has been created represents the eternal thought, the life that it had in the Logos before the world was. Unless one were compelled to take this thought by the exigencies of the textual criticism, we should hesitate to affirm that this can be the author's intention. To us the common punctuation is far more satisfactory m meaning: <span class="accented">Apart from him there came into existence not one thing which has come into existence.</span> This, in its grand comprehensiveness and individualizing of every molecule and every force, brings the mind of the reader down from eternity to time, from the creation to the preservation and providence of the world, and it prepares the way for the great assertion of the following verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 The plainest reason why the Son of God is called the Word, seems to be, that as our words explain our minds to others, so was the Son of God sent in order to reveal his Father's mind to the world. What the evangelist says of Christ proves that he is God. He asserts, His existence in the beginning; His coexistence with the Father. The Word was with God. All things were made by him, and not as an instrument. Without him was not any thing made that was made, from the highest angel to the meanest worm. This shows how well qualified he was for the work of our redemption and salvation. The light of reason, as well as the life of sense, is derived from him, and depends upon him. This eternal Word, this true Light shines, but the darkness comprehends it not. Let us pray without ceasing, that our eyes may be opened to behold this Light, that we may walk in it; and thus be made wise unto salvation, by faith in Jesus Christ.</body></html>
