The word means a stone, but the writer translated for Greek, not for English readers. The rule of the previous verse, which places the Greek word in the text and the English word in the margin, should be followed here.<p><span class= "bld">Cephas.</span>--The word occurs only in this place in the Gospels, elsewhere in the New Testament only in St. Paul (1 Cor. and Gal.). Remembering the general significance of Hebrew names, the changes in the Old Testament as of Abram, Sarai, and Jacob, and among these first disciples as of James and John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-16.htm" title="And Simon he surnamed Peter;">Mark 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-18.htm" title="And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,">Mark 3:18</a>), all these names of Peter seem meant to characterise the man,--"Thou art now Hearer, the Son of Jehovah's Grace; thou shalt be called and be a Rock-man." (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">brought</span> (the past tense) <span class="cmt_word">him to Jesus</span>; as one entirely sympathetic and as eagerly longing for the Christ, for the Lamb of God, for the King of Israel. Seeing that Simon was found so soon - most probably on the evening of the memorable day - we gather that Simon also must have been among the hearers of John. He too must have left his fishing to listen to the Baptist. The entire group must have been drawn away from their ordinary avocations by the trumpet call of the preacher in the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus looked</span> - intently, with penetrating glance - <span class="cmt_word">upon him, and said, Thou art Simon, the Son of</span> <span class="cmt_word">John</span> - that is the name by which thou hast been introduced to me; a time is coming for thee to receive a new name - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called</span> <span class="cmt_word">Cephas</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which is interpreted, Peter</span>). It is perfectly gratuitous of Baur and Hilgenfeld to imagine this to be a fictitious adaptation of the great scene recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16.htm">Matthew 16</a>. The solemn assertions made there proceed upon the assumption of the previous conference of the <span class="accented">name</span> "Peter." There the Lord said, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock," etc. On this earlier occasion Jesus said, "Thou art Simon, thou shalt be called <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>." The assumption of the Tubingen critics, that a desire to lower Peter from his primacy is conspicuous in this passage, cannot be sustained. Though Andrew and John precede Peter in their earliest relations with Jesus, yet Peter is undoubtedly the most conspicuous character, to whom the Lord from the first gives an honourable cognomen (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-67.htm">John 6:67-69</a> and John 21:15, etc.). (Compare here, for historic changes of name, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>.) Weiss ('Life of Christ,' Eng. trans., 1:370) says admirably, "There is no ground for assuming that this is an anticipation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>. Simon was not to bear this name until he was deserving of it. Jesus never called him anything but Simon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-37.htm">Mark 14:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-25.htm">Matthew 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). Paul calls him by the names Peter and Cephas.... The evangelist is right when he beholds in this scene a more than human acumen. ... The history shows he was not deceived in Peter." This narrative cannot be a Johannine setting forth of the first call of the four disciples as given in the synoptists. If it be, it is a fictitious modification. Place, occasion, and immediate result are all profoundly different. The one narrative cannot be twisted into the other. Are the anti-harmonists correct in saying that they are irreconcilable? Certainly not. There is no indication that before John was cast into prison, before Jesus commenced his public ministry in Galilee, he had called disciples away from their ordinary duties to be his apostles. Some of these four may have returned, as Jesus himself did, to his family and domestic surroundings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>). John may have accompanied Jesus to Jerusalem and through Samaria. But there is much to make it probable that Simon, Andrew, and at least, were, during the whole of that period, on the lake pondering the future. Christ's solemn, sudden call to them to become "fishers of men," after a manifestation to them of his supernatural powers, presupposes rather than excludes this earlier interview. Simon, on that occasion, by the exclamation recorded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-5.htm">Luke 5:5</a>), reveals an earlier acquaintance with and reverence for his <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (see an admirable vindication of this position in Weiss, 'Life of Jesus,' vol. 1.). The Lord, in this first interview, penetrates and denominates the character of the most illustrious of his followers. His rocklike fortitude, which, though sorely assailed and chafed by the storms of the great sea of opinion and prejudice, formed the central nucleus of that Church against which the gates of hell have not prevailed. Our Lord implied the strength of his nature, even when he predicted his great fall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:37-42 The strongest and most prevailing argument with an awakened soul to follow Christ, is, that it is he only who takes away sin. Whatever communion there is between our souls and Christ, it is he who begins the discourse. He asked, What seek ye? The question Jesus put to them, we should all put to ourselves when we begin to follow Him, What do we design and desire? In following Christ, do we seek the favour of God and eternal life? He invites them to come without delay. Now is the accepted time, 2Co 6:2. It is good for us to be where Christ is, wherever it be. We ought to labour for the spiritual welfare of those related to us, and seek to bring them to Him. Those who come to Christ, must come with a fixed resolution to be firm and constant to him, like a stone, solid and stedfast; and it is by his grace that they are so.</body></html>
