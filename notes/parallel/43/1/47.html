He is coming, when the look directed towards others rests also upon him. It finds the character which it tests earnest and honest. What gave rise to the form in which this is expressed is not stated. There is clearly some unexpressed link with the history of Jacob. The word for "guile" is the same word as the LXX. word for "subtlety" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-35.htm" title="And he said, Your brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your blessing.">Genesis 27:35</a>. The thought then is, "Behold one who is true to the name of Israel, and in whom there is nothing of the Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm" title="And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?">Genesis 27:36</a>). There is something in the words which comes as a revelation to Nathanael. Were they a proof that the Presence before whom he stood read to the very depths of his own thought? Under the shade of a tree, where Jews were accustomed to retire for meditation and prayer, had the Old Testament history of Jacob been present to his mind? Was he too "left alone," and did he "prevail with God?" And does he now hear the inmost thought expressed in words, carrying certainty to his soul, and giving him too the victory of seeing God "face to face with life preserved?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm" title="And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.">Genesis 32:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him</span> - for Nathanael at once obeyed the summons of Philip - <span class="cmt_word">and saith of him</span>; not, <span class="accented">to him</span> - saith in the hearing of the unnamed disciple, who could not leave his Master's side. There are numerous indications in ch. 1 and 2 of a qualification of Jesus which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-25.htm">John 2:25</a>, is described as knowing what was in man. He read the thought and character of Simon and Philip, of Nathanael, and of his mother; and here he makes use of his Divine prerogative and, as on a multitude of other occasions, penetrated the surface to the inner motive and heart. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, an Israelite indeed;</span> one who fulfils the true idea of Israel, a prince with God, a conqueror of God by prayer, and conqueror of man by submission, penitence, and restitution; one who has renounced the spirit of supplanter and taken that of penitent. "Confident in self-despair," he has relinquished his own strength, and lays hold of the strength of God, and is at peace. <span class="cmt_word">In whom is no guile;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no self-deception, and no disposition to deceive others. The (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1, 2</a>) description of the blessedness of "the man whose transgressions are forgiven,... and in whose spirit [LXX., 'mouth'] there is no guile (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," is the finest key to the significance of this passage. Christ does not say that this man is <span class="accented">sinless</span>, but guileless - free and full in his confession, knowing himself, and sheltering himself under no devices or seeming shows. The publican (it has been well said) was without guile when he cried, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" The Pharisee was steeped in self-deception and guile when he said, "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men." Sincerity, openness of eye, simplicity of speech, no wish to appear other than what he is before God and man, affirms his guilelessness. Alas! the so called Israelite has widely departed from the fundamental idea of such a character, though not more so than Christians have become unlike the ideal disciples of Jesus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:43-51 See the nature of true Christianity, it is following Jesus; devoting ourselves to him, and treading in his steps. Observe the objection Nathanael made. All who desire to profit by the word of God, must beware of prejudices against places, or denominations of men. They should examine for themselves, and they will sometimes find good where they looked for none. Many people are kept from the ways of religion by the unreasonable prejudices they conceive. The best way to remove false notions of religion, is to make trial of it. In Nathanael there was no guile. His profession was not hypocritical. He was not a dissembler, nor dishonest; he was a sound character, a really upright, godly man. Christ knows what men are indeed. Does He know us? Let us desire to know him. Let us seek and pray to be Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile; truly Christians, approved of Christ himself. Some things weak, imperfect, and sinful, are found in all, but hypocrisy belongs not to a believer's character. Jesus witnessed what passed when Nathanael was under the fig-tree. Probably he was then in fervent prayer, seeking direction as to the Hope and Consolation of Israel, where no human eye observed him. This showed him that our Lord knew the secrets of his heart. Through Christ we commune with, and benefit by the holy angels; and things in heaven and things on earth are reconciled and united together.</body></html>
