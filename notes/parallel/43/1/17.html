The Old Testament thought of grace and truth has been already present in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>. The fulness of these divine attributes has been beheld in the glory of the Word. The revelation of them, that is, the removing of the veil which hides the knowable, has been made dependent on the use of the already known. But this is the essence of Christianity as distinct from Judaism; of a spiritual religion developed from within as distinct from a formal religion imposed from without; of a religion of principles, and therefore true for all time and for all men, as distinct from a religion of works, based, indeed, on an eternal truth (the oneness and the righteousness of God) but still specially designed for a chosen people and for a period of preparation. The law was given (from without) by the human agency of Moses. The true grace and truth came into being by means of Jesus Christ. Therefore it is that we receive grace for grace, there being in Him an ever constant fulness of grace, and for the man who uses the grace thus given an ever constant realisation of deeper truth. Note that here, when the divinity and humanity have both been dwelt upon, and in contrast to the historic Moses, the name Jesus Christ first appears. Is there, too, in this union of the human and divine names a reference to the union in Him of the faculty to receive and the truth to fulfil? St. Luke speaks of Him as "increasing in wisdom and stature, and in <span class= "ital">favour</span> (grace) with God and man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>; see Note there).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is sustained by calling attention to the contrast between the two methods of Divine communication. <span class="cmt_word">Because the Law was given through Moses;</span> "Law," which in Paul's writings had been even looked at by itself as an "antithesis to grace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>). The Law principle of approach to God fails through the weakness of the flesh. The will is too far enslaved for it to yield spontaneously to the majesty of the Lawgiver, or to feel the attractions of obedience. The Law condemns, - it is incapable of justifying the ungodly: the Law terrifies, - it never reconciles. The Law even provokes to sin and excites the passions which it punishes. Law was <span class="accented">given</span> through Moses, pointing to the historic fact of the pomp and splendour of its first delivery, associated therefore with the greatest human name in all past history. Law was a "gift," a Divine bestowment of entirely unspeakable value to those who were ignorant of the mind and will of God. Even the ministration of death was glorious. The knowledge of an ideal perfection is a great advance, even though no power should accompany the ideal to draw the soul towards it. To know what is right, even without help to do it, save in the form of sanction, or penalty appealing to the lower nature, is better and nobler than to sin in utter ignorance. The Law was given "<span class="accented">through"</span> the mind, voice, conscience, and will of Moses. And alongside of him may be supposed to be ranged all the mighty sages and legislators of the human race - all who have thus been the mouthpiece of the Divine idea, all who have impressed the "ought" and "ought not," the "shall" and "shall not," upon mankind. Moses is not the <span class="accented">author</span> of the Law, the "giving" of the Law was not <span class="accented">by</span> Moses, but <span class="accented">through</span> his instrumentality. <span class="cmt_word">Grace and truth,</span> however, <span class="cmt_word">came</span> - became, passed into activity in human nature - <span class="cmt_word">through Jesus Christ.</span> For "grace and truth" (see notes, ver. 14), the highest manifestation and self-communication of Divine love and Divine thought, came into human experience through Jesus Christ. A vast and wonderful contrast is here made between all earlier or other dispensations and that of which the apostle proceeds to speak. Divine favour and help, the life of God himself in the soul of man, awakening love in response to the Divine love; and Divine thought so made known as to bring all the higher faculties of man into direct contact with reality, are an enormous advance upon Lawgiving. The appropriate human response to Law is obedience; the appropriate human response to love is of the same nature with itself - nothing less than love; so the only adequate response to Divine truth is faith; to Divine thought may follow human thought. All this forth streaming of grace and truth originated in the person of <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, and became possible through him. This great <span class="accented">Name</span>, this blending of the human and Divine, of saving grace and Messianic dignity, of ancient expectations and recent realization, is only twice more used in the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a> and John 20:31); but it pervades it throughout, and, though not actually said to be equivalent to the <span class="accented">Word made flesh</span>, yet no shadow of doubt is left that this was the apostle's meaning. Here the full significance of the prologue really bursts into view to one who reads it for the first time (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-3</a>). Difficulty may be felt by some as to the actual Capacity of Jesus Christ to reveal the Divine thought, or <span class="accented">the truth</span>, and so the closing verse of the prologue vindicates the claim of the Saviour of the world to be the truth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-18 As to the order of time and entrance on his work, Christ came after John, but in every other way he was before him. The expression clearly shows that Jesus had existence before he appeared on earth as man. All fulness dwells in him, from which alone fallen sinners have, and shall receive, by faith, all that renders them wise, strong, holy, useful, and happy. Our receivings by Christ are all summed up in this one word, grace; we have received even grace, a gift so great, so rich, so invaluable; the good will of God towards us, and the good work of God in us. The law of God is holy, just, and good; and we should make the proper use of it. But we cannot derive from it pardon, righteousness, or strength. It teaches us to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour, but it cannot supply the place of that doctrine. As no mercy comes from God to sinners but through Jesus Christ, no man can come to the Father but by him; no man can know God, except as he is made known in the only begotten and beloved Son.</body></html>
