Elsewhere, John, as the other sacred writers, uses the LXX. translation, "Christ," and even here he adds it (comp., <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in this John <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-20.htm" title="And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.">John 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a>). Both words mean "anointed" (see margin, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm" title="All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made you glad.">Psalm 45:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">The Messiah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He</span> (Andrew) <span class="cmt_word">first</span> <span class="cmt_word">findeth his own brother Simon.</span> Dr. Plummer here observes, "In Church history St. Peter is everything, and St. Andrew nothing: but would there have been an Apostle Peter but for Andrew?" Hengstenberg, De Wette, and others have explained the curious word "first," as though both the unnamed disciple and Andrew had gone together to search out Simon, and that Andrew had been the first of the two to be successful. This would leave the <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> less satisfactorily accounted for than the simple supposition that each of the disciples started in different directions to find "his own" brother, and that Andrew was more fortunate than his companion. The two pairs of brothers are frequently mentioned as being together. James and John, Andrew and Simon, are partners on the lake of Galilee in their fishing business, and are finally called into full discipleship and apostolate after the visit to Jerusalem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19, 11</a>). The four are specially mentioned as being together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>), so that it is not unreasonable to suggest that when Andrew first sought "his own" brother Simon, John also sought for "his own" brother James. It is worthy of note that the evangelist never mentions his own name, nor that of James, nor that of their mother Salome, although he does imply their presence. Andrew <span class="cmt_word">saith to him</span> (Simon), <span class="cmt_word">We have found the Messias</span> - the article is omitted, as <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is merely the translation of" Messiah" - (<span class="cmt_word">which</span>, adds the evangelist, <span class="cmt_word">is, being interpreted, Christ</span>). Andrew is described on two additional occasions as bringing others to Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-8.htm">John 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-22.htm">John 12:22</a>). Here the rapidity and depth of his convictions are noted. The writer's own impression is implied rather than given. He hides his own faith under the bolder and more explicit utterance of his friend. This was the result upon the mind of two disciples of the first conference with Jesus. Marvellous enough that such a thought should have possessed them, however imperfect their ideas were as yet concerning the Christ! The <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> implies that they had long been waiting for the Consolation of Israel, looking for his coming, seeking his appearing. "We have sought," they say, "and we have found." A more wonderful <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> than that of Archimedes. The plural does not necessitate the presence of John, though it does suggest the agreement of Andrew and his friend in the same august conclusion. What sense of Divine things must have come from the words and looks of Jesus! He who produced such impression on the Baptist as that which the four evangelists report, had done even more with the susceptible spirits of his two disciples. The Baptist never actually called Jesus "the Christ." But when he had testified to the pre-existing glory, the heavenly origin, the sublime functions of the great <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and by special revelation on his forewarned spirit had declared that he was the Son of God, the Lamb of God, and the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost and fire: what must not the inference be when his two disciples came into yet closer and more intimate relations with Jesus? The Jewish idea of "Messiah" (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, only occurring here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>), equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, Aramaized form, the <span class="accented">stat. emphat</span>, of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>); cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> (Kautzsch, 'Gram. des Bib. Aram.,' p. 10), was the term used among all classes to denote One who should, as anointed by God, fulfil the functions of Prophet, Priest and King, who should realize the splendid visions of the ancient prophecies, and combine in himself a wonderful exhibition of Divine majesty and even of awful suffering. We see that the Baptist understood what was meant by the title, but denied its applicability to himself. The Samaritans believe in a coming Prophet and Saviour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25, 29</a>). The people believe that Messiah will work miracles, that he will be born in Bethlehem, that he will abide forever, that he would prove to be the Son of God. The King Messiah is a pre-existing power and presence in their past history. He will come in the clouds, and reign forever and ever (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-26.htm">John 7:26, 31</a> and John 7:42; John 12:34). According to W&uuml;nsche ('Neue Beitrage zurerlauterung der Ev., aus Talmud und Midrasch,' pp. 499, 500), the Talmud ('Pesachim,' 54, and 'Nedavim,' 39) declares that Messias, or his Name, was one of the seven things created before the world; and Midrasch ('Schemoth,' par. 19) on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> declares that the King Messias was the Firstborn of God. The more spiritual ideas of John the Baptist have prepared the two disciples to see, even in the travel-stained, lowly Man, "the Messiah." Of course, their idea of Messiah and their idea of Jesus would suffer wonderful development, and be harmonized and blended into a sublime unity by later instructions; but they had made this great discovery, and hastened to impart it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:37-42 The strongest and most prevailing argument with an awakened soul to follow Christ, is, that it is he only who takes away sin. Whatever communion there is between our souls and Christ, it is he who begins the discourse. He asked, What seek ye? The question Jesus put to them, we should all put to ourselves when we begin to follow Him, What do we design and desire? In following Christ, do we seek the favour of God and eternal life? He invites them to come without delay. Now is the accepted time, 2Co 6:2. It is good for us to be where Christ is, wherever it be. We ought to labour for the spiritual welfare of those related to us, and seek to bring them to Him. Those who come to Christ, must come with a fixed resolution to be firm and constant to him, like a stone, solid and stedfast; and it is by his grace that they are so.</body></html>
