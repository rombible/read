(Comp. on this and the following question, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm" title="The LORD your God will raise up to you a Prophet from the middle of you, of your brothers, like to me; to him you shall listen;">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-18.htm" title="I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brothers, like to you, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>; Isaiah 40 ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-1.htm" title="It is also found in the records, that Jeremy the prophet commanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as it hath been signified:">2 Maccabees 2:1-8</a>; and Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-14.htm" title="And they said, Some say that you are John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.">Matthew 16:14</a>). The angel had announced that "he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias." The Lord declared "Elias is come already" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/18-12.htm" title="How think you? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not leave the ninety and nine, and goes into the mountains, and seeks that which is gone astray?">Matthew 18:12-13</a>), and yet the Forerunner can assert that, in the literal sense in which they ask the question and would understand the answer, he is not Elias, still less "the prophet," by which, whether thinking of the words of Moses or the fuller vision of Isaiah from which he immediately quotes, he would understand the Messiah himself,<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they asked him, What then?</span> What is the state of the case? The very repudiation of Messiahship in this form seems to imply some association with the Messianic period of which they had so many conflicting ideas. Malachi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>) had predicted the coming again from heaven of Elijah the prophet, and the LXX., by translating the passage "Elijah the Tishbite," had strengthened the common mistake of a metempsychosis, or such an abnormal manifestation before the coming of Messiah. Schottgen ('De Messia,' H.H., vol. 2, pp 226, 490, 533-537) quotes a variety of proofs of this anticipation, and that Elijah was expected "<span class="accented">three</span> days before Messiah; that he would come in the mountains of Israel, weeping over the people, saying, 'O land of Israel, how long will you remain arid and desolate!'" (cf. my 'John the Baptist,' 3. &sect; 4). There was a true sense in which (as our Lord informed his disciples) John was the fulfilment of Malachi's prediction and of the language of the angel to Zacharias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-12.htm">Matthew 17:12</a>), and that John came veritably in the spirit and power of Elijah. In that sense "Elijah had come already," just as Christ their <span class="accented">David</span> had come, in fulfilment of Ezekiel's vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>), to rule over them. In the physical, superstitious sense, John the son of Zacharias was not the reincarnation of the Prophet Elijah, and so he boldly answered the inquiry, <span class="cmt_word">Art thou Elijah?</span> with a categorical negative: I am not. They press their question once more. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou the Prophet?</span> It is doubtful whether they here take up another popular expectation of the physical return of one of the old prophets, or whether, with an exegesis afterwards modified by the apostles, they point to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, and reveal the fact that they had not identified the prediction of "the prophet like unto Moses" with their Messiah. If they <span class="accented">had</span> identified these representations, they would not, of course, have pressed him with an identical question. It is highly probable that <span class="accented">that</span> prophecy had, with the predictions of Malachi and Isaiah, led to numerous expectations more or less identified with the Messianic cycle of coming events. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-14.htm">Matthew 16:14</a>, we see the prevalence of the expectation - of a longing for an old prophet. They yearned for no upstart, but for one of the mighty brotherhood of departed men, in veritable flesh and blood. Now John and now Jesus was crudely suspected by some to be such a resuscitation. The Baptist, like the Samaritan woman, and subsequently St. Peter when full of the Holy Ghost, had sharply identified "the Prophet like unto Moses" with the Messiah himself; and therefore, on either hypothesis, he gives a curt reply to this inquiry, <span class="cmt_word">and he answered, No.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:19-28 John disowns himself to be the Christ, who was now expected and waited for. He came in the spirit and power of Elias, but he was not the person of Elias. John was not that Prophet whom Moses said the Lord would raise up to them of their brethren, like unto him. He was not such a prophet as they expected, who would rescue them from the Romans. He gave such an account of himself, as might excite and awaken them to hearken to him. He baptized the people with water as a profession of repentance, and as an outward sign of the spiritual blessings to be conferred on them by the Messiah, who was in the midst of them, though they knew him not, and to whom he was unworthy to render the meanest service.</body></html>
