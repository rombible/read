If they were among those "which see not" they would be conscious of their blindness, and would seek for spiritual light. They would ask, "Who is He, Lord, that we may believe on Him?" and would not ask in vain. In that case their present rejection of Him would arise from ignorance willing to be overcome, and this ignorance, not being wilful, would not be sin. Conscious ignorance would be the first step towards knowledge.<p><span class= "bld">But now ye say, We see.</span>--Their true place is among those who were spiritually blind, and were unconscious of it, "they which see," they which think they see." For them the first step towards true spiritual light must be a consciousness of blindness. As it is, as long as they think that they see, there is no ground for hope. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/9-12.htm" title="But when Jesus heard that, he said to them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.">Matthew 9:12-13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Therefore your sin remaineth.</span>--The word "therefore" should probably be omitted. The words "Your sin remaineth," or better, <span class= "ital">Your sin abideth</span> (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm" title="He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.">John 3:36</a>), stand alone in their awful solemnity. They stand side by side with "Ye say, We see." The two states are one. The assertion of spiritual knowledge and independence was the original cause of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-4.htm" title="And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die:">Genesis 3:4</a>), and while spiritual pride exists sin cannot cease.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - The reply of our Lord is not meant to be a crushing and final retort, condemning them to hopeless night, but was obviously intended to show them that they are not yet free from <span class="accented">sin</span>, that they are only partially appreciating the light which shines upon them. <span class="cmt_word">If ye were blind</span> - incapable of sight; if ye had all along been deprived of the faculty of perceiving the true Light that shineth in the darkness (a condition of things which would have emancipated them from responsibility, and which Christ would not admit to be the case); perhaps more, if ye had been utterly blind to the light which is shining upon you now, which, however, is not true - <span class="cmt_word">ye would not have sin</span>. This is akin to the solemn language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22-24</a>. They did not themselves admit that there was any congenital blindness about them. They did not pretend or expect to ride off on such a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, such an excuse. Could they be, judicially or naturally, blind? The very idea was an absurdity, and so Jesus added, <span class="cmt_word">But now ye say, We see.</span> You even boast that you are "instructors of the ignorant, and leaders of the blind; a light to those who sit in darkness, having the form of knowledge and truth in the Law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-21</a>). You are the very opposite of the "not-seeing" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); you are self-satisfied; you will not come to the Light. What is the issue? The Lord seems to pause before his answer (the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, "therefore," is rejected by the best manuscripts and critics): <span class="cmt_word">Your sin abideth</span>; or, <span class="accented">remaineth</span>. It will remain until you fully admit the great principle and reason, the motive and characteristics, of my mission. The very facility you profess, the intimacy you claim with the Law and its founder, and your partial knowledge of my claim, take away your excuse. The discourse which follows shows how entire must be the submission to Christ, how complete the union with him, of those who say, "We see." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:39-41 Christ came into the world to give sight to those who were spiritually blind. Also, that those who see might be made blind; that those who have a high conceit of their own wisdom, might be sealed up in ignorance. The preaching of the cross was thought to be folly by such as by carnal wisdom knew not God. Nothing fortifies men's corrupt hearts against the convictions of the word, more than the high opinion which others have of them; as if all that gained applause with men, must obtain acceptance with God. Christ silenced them. But the sin of the self-conceited and self-confident remains; they reject the gospel of grace, therefore the guilt of their sin remains unpardoned, and the power of their sin remains unbroken.</body></html>
