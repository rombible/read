His first answer was in the fewest possible words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-15.htm" title="Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and do see.">John 9:15</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.">John 9:7</a>), and even these he will not repeat. There is some difficulty about the meaning of the word "hear" in the two clauses of this verse. When the man says "Ye did not hear," we naturally understand "did not heed;" but when he goes on to say, "Wherefore would ye hear it again? the word clearly has its ordinary sense of hearing. The same word occurs in the two clauses in the Greek, just as it does in the English, and we are scarcely justified in giving it two distinct meanings. If we were to read both clauses as questions, we should avoid this difficulty, and get a sense which would suit the evident feeling of the man. He is impatient, and expresses this in a series of rapid questions. "I have told you already, and did ye not hear? wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be His disciples?"<p><span class= "bld">Will ye also be his disciples?</span><span class= "ital">--</span>The words refer, probably, to some who are His disciples, not to the man himself as being, or being ready to become, a disciple. This is a further stage of his spiritual education which is to follow, but has not yet arrived (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/9-35.htm" title="Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?">John 9:35-38</a>). The man must have known of the existence of a band of disciples, who indeed in his presence had questioned their Master concerning him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-2.htm" title="And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?">John 9:2</a>), and it is not unlikely that while the parents were being questioned, the son may have learnt more concerning the work of Christ. The question puts the irony in the severest form, "Surely <span class= "ital">ye</span> also do not wish to become His disciples?" It may have been designed, or may only have been as an arrow drawn at a venture; but there must have been among those of whom it was asked, men who tried in vain to encase themselves in the armour of authority, which would repel his shaft and silence him. It must have gone through the joints of the harness and pierced to the hearts of men like Nicodemus, who were half-disciples without the "courage of their convictions." Here was the blind beggar making an open avowal of that which the Pharisees and rulers dared only to confess by night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm" title="The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.">John 3:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He answered them, I told you already, and ye did not hear</span> (the Italic Versions and the Vulgate here omit the negation, which De Wette says would be caster of comprehension; but as it stands, the sentence is equivalent to "you had no ears, you took no heed, if you had already listened to the simple facts"): <span class="cmt_word">wherefore would ye hear it again?</span> You will pay no more heed now than then; or do ye want to transform it into a charge? There is another alternative, stated in either humble pleading or ironical retort, according as we interpret the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>. The next question is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> (Lutbardt) <span class="accented">Would you also be his disciples</span>, like the many multitudes who are shouting his praise? is that your bent? surely not! or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it may mean, <span class="accented">Is it possible that it is in your mind</span>, not only to find out all about the how of this great miracle, but <span class="accented">also to become his disciples?</span> Neither of these interpretations is perfectly consistent with his taunt, "ye did not hear." Therefore <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> (Bengel) the most natural meaning is, <span class="cmt_word">Would ye also</span>, as well as myself, the poor beggar, <span class="cmt_word">become his disciples</span>? (so Westcott, Moulton, and Lange). The poor man was roused, ironical, and ready, notwithstanding the threat of the great excommunication hanging over him, to announce his own discipleship to any extent and at any risk. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:24-34 As Christ's mercies are most valued by those who have felt the want of them, that have been blind, and now see; so the most powerful and lasting affections to Christ, arise from actual knowledge of him. In the work of grace in the soul, though we cannot tell when, and how, and by what steps the blessed change was wrought, yet we may take the comfort, if we can say, through grace, Whereas I was blind, now I see. I did live a worldly, sensual life, but, thanks be to God, it is now otherwise with me, Eph 5:8. The unbelief of those who enjoy the means of knowledge and conviction, is indeed marvellous. All who have felt the power and grace of the Lord Jesus, wonder at the wilfulness of others who reject him. He argues strongly against them, not only that Jesus was not a sinner, but that he was of God. We may each of us know by this, whether we are of God or not. What do we? What do we for God? What do we for our souls? What do we more than others?</body></html>
