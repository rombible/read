The power, though given in this instance for the first time, was usually a restored power, and this is expressed in the word. This man uses the ordinary language of men, though, in strictness it was not applicable to his own case. This use of the word is, moreover, justified by other examples.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> - the man there singled out - <span class="cmt_word">answered</span> (<span class="cmt_word">and said</span>), <span class="cmt_word">The Man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Siloam, and wash.

The name is full of significance to him - the "Savior,': the "Healer;" but he knows nothing of his Messianic claims, nor of his Divine authority. He began, where all disciples must, with the <span class="accented">Man</span>. The manner of man soon wakes within him loftier questionings and a better explanation. At present the process seems magical, altogether inexplicable. Clay and Siloam water do not cure birth-blindness, he is in a maze, as well he might be. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> should be rendered, according to Meyer, "I looked up" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-4.htm">Mark 16:4</a>). It cannot be so translated in vers. 15 and 18. Doubtless it strictly means, "I received sight again;" but there is something in Grotius's explanation, "No one is incorrectly said to <span class="accented">receive</span> that which, though he be deprived of it, belongs to human nature as a whole" (see Westcott). The eyes were there, but unused. Meyer quotes from Pausanias the similar use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in reference to the recovery or obtaining of sight by a man born blind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:8-12 Those whose eyes are opened, and whose hearts are cleansed by grace, being known to be the same person, but widely different in character, live as monuments to the Redeemer's glory, and recommend his grace to all who desire the same precious salvation. It is good to observe the way and method of God's works, and they will appear the more wonderful. Apply this spiritually. In the work of grace wrought upon the soul we see the change, but we see not the hand that makes it: the way of the Spirit is like that of the wind, which thou hearest the sound of, but canst not tell whence it comes, nor whither it goes.</body></html>
