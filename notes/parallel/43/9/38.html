His half-faith has passed into full conviction. The spiritual education has led him step by step from "the Man that is called Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-11.htm" title="He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.">John 9:11</a>) to the confession that He is "a prophet" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-17.htm" title="They say to the blind man again, What say you of him, that he has opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.">John 9:17</a>), and that He is "of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-33.htm" title="If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.">John 9:33</a>), to the belief that He is the Messiah. It is. the course of a plain man in the honesty of his heart daring to think for himself, and to act upon his convictions. He declines to be silenced by authority, or ensnared in the mazes of argument. The ultimate facts of his own consciousness supply him with a definite foundation of truth, and this is immoveable. The steps by which he advances in knowledge are a striking comment on the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And he worshipped him.</span>--The act of adoration is the necessary expression of his faith in the Son of God. We may not think that he has yet learnt all that this term includes; but he has at least learnt that the Son of God has the attribute of the divine glory, and is the object of human worship. It should be noted that St. John uses the word here rendered "worshipped" only when speaking of the worship of God. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-20.htm" title="Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.">John 4:20-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-20.htm" title="And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:">John 12:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Lord, I believe</span> - the <span class="accented">Kyrie</span> means more than in ver. 36 - <span class="cmt_word">and he worshipped him</span>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is used by John for homage paid to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-20.htm">John 12:20</a>; and twenty-three times in the Revelation, always in the sense of "worship"). This prostration, when no prayer was offered, no forgiveness asked, but a simple act of faith exercised, was nothing less than the highest homage the man could pay. The adoration of this man is a fitting climax to the scene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>), and anticipates that of Thomas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>). The higher significance of the Sonship dawned upon him in the unearthly tone and manner of the Lord. These scenes, and the offer of Divine homage unrebuked by Jesus and uncommented upon by the evangelist, are among the most potent arguments for the belief of the Church in the Divine nature of the Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:35-38 Christ owns those who own him and his truth and ways. There is particular notice taken of such a suffer in the cause of Christ, and for the testimony of a good conscience. Our Lord Jesus graciously reveals himself to the man. Now he was made sensible what an unspeakable mercy it was, to be cured of his blindness, that he might see the Son of God. None but God is to be worshipped; so that in worshipping Jesus, he owned him to be God. All who believe in him, will worship him.</body></html>
