(2) That God heareth this Man is certain, for such a miracle could be performed only by divine power. (3) This Man, therefore, is not a sinner, but is from God.<p>He assumes as a general truth, which all accepted, that God heareth not sinners. This is based upon numerous passages in the Old Testament Scriptures--<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-18.htm" title="If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:">Psalm 66:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-7.htm" title="When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.">Psalm 109:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-8.htm" title="The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.">Proverbs 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-29.htm" title="The LORD is far from the wicked: but he hears the prayer of the righteous.">Proverbs 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-9.htm" title="Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?">Job 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-13.htm" title="Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.">Job 35:13</a>. We are, of course, to understand the word "sinner" in the sense in which they had used it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm" title="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.">John 9:24</a>. They had said that they knew this Man to be a sinner, and they meant one who was a sinner in a darker sense than that in which the word may be applied to all men. He asserts, as a truth which agrees with the whole teaching of the Old Testament, and with all the religious instincts of men, that there would be no communion between such a man and heaven. Such a one could not be commissioned as a prophet, or so heard in heaven as to have power to work miracles on earth. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/11-41.htm" title="Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.">John 11:41-42</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm" title="And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?">Acts 3:12</a>.) Men have sometimes taken the words altogether apart from their context, and read into them a dark meaning which they cannot be rightly made to bear. Neither these words, nor any words of God, assign any limit to the divine grace, which extendeth to every penitent sinner; nor is there any voice of any child of man lifted to heaven, which is not heard by the Father who is in heaven.<p>It has often been noted here that the words are spoken by one whose authority does not make them binding upon us; but it is clear that they were accepted. as a general truth. We need no other explanation if we bear in mind the special sense which is here attached to the word "sinner."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We know</span> - the new-born disputant takes up the language of these proud casuists, and adopts the technical phrase which they had used (vers. 24, 29) - we <span class="accented">know</span>, you and I, t<span class="cmt_word">hat God heareth not sinners</span> in any special sense of miraculous approval (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-9.htm">Job 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-13.htm">Job 35:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7</a>; and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-29.htm">Proverbs 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>). One aspect of Old Testament teaching shows that a man must delight himself in the Lord in order to receive the desires of his heart. If we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us; but the prayer of the sinner, the desire of the wicked, is contrary to the will of' God. When the sinner turns from his sins to the Lord, the cry for mercy is in harmony with the will of God. In one sense every prayer is the prayer of sinful men; but it is the Divine life working within them that offers acceptable prayer. The prayer of the sinner as such is not heard. We know God does not listen to the cry of sinners, when, as sinners, they ask from the ground of their sin, to secure their own sinful purpose; <span class="cmt_word">but if any man be a worshipper of God</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and occurs nowhere else in the New Testament), <span class="cmt_word">and doeth his</span> (God's) <span class="cmt_word">will, this man he heareth</span>. The blind beggar has learned the deepest truth of the Divine revelation about the conditions of acceptable prayer. The immediate application was the miraculous unwonted event as answer to the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16-18</a>). So much for the general relation of this Healer to God. The rabbis were never tired of urging that the "answers to prayer depended on a man being devout and doing the will of God" (Edersheim, who quotes 'Ber.,' 6, b; 'Taanith,' 3:8; 'Succah,' 14, a; 'Yoma,' 28, a). So that the man was here fighting with drawn sword. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:24-34 As Christ's mercies are most valued by those who have felt the want of them, that have been blind, and now see; so the most powerful and lasting affections to Christ, arise from actual knowledge of him. In the work of grace in the soul, though we cannot tell when, and how, and by what steps the blessed change was wrought, yet we may take the comfort, if we can say, through grace, Whereas I was blind, now I see. I did live a worldly, sensual life, but, thanks be to God, it is now otherwise with me, Eph 5:8. The unbelief of those who enjoy the means of knowledge and conviction, is indeed marvellous. All who have felt the power and grace of the Lord Jesus, wonder at the wilfulness of others who reject him. He argues strongly against them, not only that Jesus was not a sinner, but that he was of God. We may each of us know by this, whether we are of God or not. What do we? What do we for God? What do we for our souls? What do we more than others?</body></html>
