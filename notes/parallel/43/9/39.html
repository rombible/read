The beggar has passed from a state of physical blindness, and has received the faculty of sight. He has passed from a state of spiritual blindness, and has received the power to recognise and believe on Jesus Christ as the Son of God. He did not see, but the result of the manifestation of the Messiah is for him that he now does see. Conscious of his own spiritual blindness, he asked, "Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him?" and to him, as to every earnest and humble seeker after truth, because in all his seeming need he really "hath," there is given that he may "have more abundance." In marked contrast to this spirit of humility and desire to come to the light, was that of the Pharisees. They claimed to have the "key of knowledge" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm" title="At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.">Matthew 11:25</a>), and were, as a Pharisee represents him who is "called a Jew," "confident that they were guides of the blind, lights of them which are in darkness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm" title="Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,">Romans 2:17</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm" title="For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.">1Corinthians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.">1Corinthians 3:18</a>). Conscious of their own spiritual light, they felt no need of a truer Light, and therefore could not see it; and from them, as from every careless and self-trusting possessor of truth, because, in all his seeming abundance, he really <span class= "ital">"</span>hath not," there is taken away "even that he hath." (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a>.)<p>This passing from darkness to light, and from light to darkness, suggests thoughts which our Lord has already uttered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-17.htm" title="For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.">John 3:17-19</a>, and which will meet us again more fully in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-37.htm" title="But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:">John 12:37-50</a>. (See Notes on these passages.) Judgment is not the ultimate end of His coming, for He came to save the world; but it is an end, and therefore a result. The special form of the word rendered "judgment" in this place is used nowhere else by St. John, and indicates that what is here thought of is not the act of judging, but the concrete result--the sentence pronounced after judgment. His coming was a bringing light into the darkness of men's hearts, a testing of the false and the true, and as men accepted or rejected Him they pronounced a judicial sentence upon themselves. That light judged no man, and yet by it every man was judged.<p><span class= "bld">That they which see not might see.</span>--The force of these words lies in the fact that the phrases, "they which see not" and "they which see," are to be interpreted as from their own point of view--"That they which think they see not might really see; and that they which think they see might really be made blind."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 39-41.</span> - (b) <span class="accented">The blindness of those who are satisfied with their twilight</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - The sight of the man, enlightened and prostrate in adoring gratitude, led Jesus, in the face of the bystanders, with Pharisees among them (ver. 40), to declare the general effects which would follow from his entire self-manifestation (so Meyer, Godet). Westcott says, "Not to any one or group, but as interpreting the scene before him." A sublime monologue. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus said, I came for judgment</span>. Not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> execute judgment, but <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, with a view to bring about a judicial decision on the moral condition of mankind (see notes on John 3:17, 18; 5:22, 23; 8:11, 15, 16) as a matter of fact. "This is the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, that men love darkness rather than light." Christ came to save - that was his supreme purpose; but to the Son is given the whole <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> will follow the revelation of the Son of God. He is the Touchstone of humanity. What men think of Christ is the question which decides in every age their moral condition before God. <span class="cmt_word">Into this world</span> of sin and strife, of crossing lights and strange delusions, of ignorance and superstition (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is different when <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is added; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>) - not the world as the mere cosmos, or the sphere of creative activity, nor even the whole of humanity as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, but humanity viewed in its separation from grace, and in all its need - <span class="cmt_word">in order that they who see not might see</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not those who merely feel that they cannot see (as Lucke, Meyer, etc.), but the practically blind - the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, those who are sitting in darkness, with the capacity for sight, but not the opportunity; who cannot, as a matter of fact, apart from the revelation of new light, see the face of God; the babes to whom the Lord of heaven and earth has been pleased to unveil himself (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>); the poor in spirit, who do not but now may see the kingdom, and the pure in heart ready to behold their God. So far the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> declares itself to be a blessed consummation - sight to the blind, cleansing to the leper, life to the dead. Even the man born blind suns himself in the heaven of the Savior's smile. The Light of the world shines upon them, and they see. But Christ's coming brings out also the character of those, and pronounces judgment on those, who say of themselves, "<span class="accented">We</span> see;" "<span class="accented">We</span> have never been in bondage," "We need no repentance;" "<span class="accented">Abraham</span> is our father;" "<span class="accented">We</span> know the Law;" "Who (nevertheless) do not come to the Light;" who are not "of the truth;" and the beaming of his unappreciated glory involves in their case, <span class="cmt_word">that those who see might become blind</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>), incapable of seeing. Those who have the knowledge of the Law, "<span class="accented">the</span> wise and prudent" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>), who boast their freedom, their knowledge, their advantages, their profession, may, nay do, by resolute turning away from "<span class="accented">the</span> Light of this world," lose their power of spiritual vision. But the unsophisticated, needy, even the publicans and harlots, consciously sitting in the region of the shadow of death, do by faith and repentance find that the great Light has unawares shone upon them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:39-41 Christ came into the world to give sight to those who were spiritually blind. Also, that those who see might be made blind; that those who have a high conceit of their own wisdom, might be sealed up in ignorance. The preaching of the cross was thought to be folly by such as by carnal wisdom knew not God. Nothing fortifies men's corrupt hearts against the convictions of the word, more than the high opinion which others have of them; as if all that gained applause with men, must obtain acceptance with God. Christ silenced them. But the sin of the self-conceited and self-confident remains; they reject the gospel of grace, therefore the guilt of their sin remains unpardoned, and the power of their sin remains unbroken.</body></html>
