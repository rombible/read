He, like his parents, will confine himself to matters of fact coming under his own certain knowledge. They had declared authoritatively that they knew this Man to be one whose life was characterised by sin. He is convinced that this cannot be so (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-31.htm" title="Now we know that God hears not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and does his will, him he hears.">John 9:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-33.htm" title="If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.">John 9:33</a>), but he does not dispute their assertion; he simply makes his own, which cannot be gainsaid, and which cuts the ground from under them.<p><span class= "bld">One thing I know.</span>--For this use of "one thing" to mark the chief thing which is so important that all others are excluded, and it is left as the only one in the mind, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-21.htm" title="Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.">Mark 10:21</a> ("one thing thou lackest") and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-42.htm" title="But one thing is needful: and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.">Luke 10:42</a> ("one thing is needful").<p><span class= "bld">Whereas I was blind, now I see.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Being a blind man, now I see.</span> He places the two things in contrast. He was the well-known "blind man," whose experience of his own blindness had extended from birth to manhood. They declare that he has not been healed. He is conscious of his power to see, and this one thing he affirms. The difficulty is of their making; let them explain it as they think best.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He therefore answered</span> (and said), <span class="cmt_word">Whether he be a sinner</span> - using the words of "the Jews" ironically - <span class="cmt_word">I know not</span>. You assert it, but the facts of my experience are altogether of a different kind. I do not know, as you say that you do. The Jews reason from foregone prejudices; the healed man has no such evidence, no such grounds - he adds in immortal words, <span class="cmt_word">One thing I know</span> with invincible conviction, <span class="cmt_word">that whereas I was blind</span> (De Wette says there is no need to regard the <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span> as an imperfect participle, and the present suggests the whole career of the man from birth till that memorable morning), <span class="cmt_word">now I see</span>. The plain consistent testimony of the man triumphs over their logic, which sought to bewilder his judgment. The language which a deeply felt experience can always bring against the <span class="accented">a priori</span> demonstrations of the insufficiency of the evidence of Divine revelation. I was blind; now I see the face of God in nature, the kingdom of God all around me, the fact of my own forgiveness, the dawning of a brighter day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:24-34 As Christ's mercies are most valued by those who have felt the want of them, that have been blind, and now see; so the most powerful and lasting affections to Christ, arise from actual knowledge of him. In the work of grace in the soul, though we cannot tell when, and how, and by what steps the blessed change was wrought, yet we may take the comfort, if we can say, through grace, Whereas I was blind, now I see. I did live a worldly, sensual life, but, thanks be to God, it is now otherwise with me, Eph 5:8. The unbelief of those who enjoy the means of knowledge and conviction, is indeed marvellous. All who have felt the power and grace of the Lord Jesus, wonder at the wilfulness of others who reject him. He argues strongly against them, not only that Jesus was not a sinner, but that he was of God. We may each of us know by this, whether we are of God or not. What do we? What do we for God? What do we for our souls? What do we more than others?</body></html>
