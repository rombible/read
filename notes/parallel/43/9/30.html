The R.T. has accurately given the force of the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, the combination of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, by the rendering "why?" The "herein" is the ignorance which the Jews now profess of the Divine call and mission of the Healer. Their confusion, their obscurity, their vacillation, on such a patent fact is the marvel of marvels, almost more wonderful than the cure of his blindness. <span class="cmt_word">That ye know not whence he is, and (yet) he opened my eyes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> not infrequently has the three of "and yet" - simple juxtaposition conveying a strong contrast; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-55.htm">John 8:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-70.htm">John 6:70</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-4.htm">John 7:4</a>). The man rises into holy and eloquent wrath. Their entire history, their principles of judging of a prophetic call, the whole modus of Divine revelation, ought to have shown that one whose simple will stood in such vivid juxtaposition with work which none but Almighty God could do, ought to have enlightened them. "The blind man, finding he was argued with, grew bolder, and began to argue in turn; if he had not studied theology (say rabbinical casuistry and Mishnaic accretions to the Divine Law), he at least knew his catechism" (Godet). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:24-34 As Christ's mercies are most valued by those who have felt the want of them, that have been blind, and now see; so the most powerful and lasting affections to Christ, arise from actual knowledge of him. In the work of grace in the soul, though we cannot tell when, and how, and by what steps the blessed change was wrought, yet we may take the comfort, if we can say, through grace, Whereas I was blind, now I see. I did live a worldly, sensual life, but, thanks be to God, it is now otherwise with me, Eph 5:8. The unbelief of those who enjoy the means of knowledge and conviction, is indeed marvellous. All who have felt the power and grace of the Lord Jesus, wonder at the wilfulness of others who reject him. He argues strongly against them, not only that Jesus was not a sinner, but that he was of God. We may each of us know by this, whether we are of God or not. What do we? What do we for God? What do we for our souls? What do we more than others?</body></html>
