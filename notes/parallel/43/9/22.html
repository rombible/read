The word rendered "agreed" occurs again in the New Testament only twice. It expresses the covenant made with Judas, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-5.htm" title="And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.">Luke 22:5</a>, and the agreement of the Jews to kill Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-20.htm" title="And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire you that you would bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.">Acts 23:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He should be put out of the synagogue.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-2.htm" title="They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes, that whoever kills you will think that he does God service.">John 16:2</a>, and Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-22.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.">Luke 6:22</a>. The Jews at a later date distinguished three kinds of excommunication. (1) The lightest continued for thirty days, and prescribed four cubits as a distance within which the person may not approach any one, not even wife or children; with this limitation, it did not make exclusion from the synagogue necessary. (2) The severer included absolute banishment from all religious meetings, and absolute giving up of intercourse with all persons, and was formally pronounced with curses. (3) The severest was a perpetual banishment from all meetings, and a practical exclusion from the fellowship of God's people. It has been sometimes supposed that the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-22.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.">Luke 6:22</a>, (<span class= "ital">a</span>) "separate you," (<span class= "ital">b</span>)<span class= "ital"> "</span>reproach you," (c) "cast out your name," refer to these gradations, but probably the only practice known in the time of our Lord was that which was later regarded as the intermediate form, falling short of perpetual banishment, but being, while the ban lasted, exclusion from all the cherished privileges of an Israelite.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The evangelist accounts for the reticence of the parents by their fear of consequences. <span class="cmt_word">These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews.</span> This passage provides strong evidence of the technical use of the term "the Jews." Doubtless these parents were Israelites, but they were not "Jews" in the Johannine sense. The "Jews" were the hierarchical and ecclesiastico-political authorities. <span class="cmt_word">For they had already come to the agreement</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-5.htm">Luke 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-20.htm">Acts 23:20</a>; 1 Macc. 9:70); had mutually determined - it does not follow that the Sanhedrin had issued a public order, but that a formidable party of "Jews" had made a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, had pledged each other and made it sufficiently known even to such persons as the poverty-stricken parents of the blind beggar, that it would be carried out by the adequate authority in such a matter - <span class="cmt_word">that if any man should confess that he was Christ</span> ("he" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) is remarkable - it shows how full the thoughts of the evangelist were of the Personality of Jesus), <span class="cmt_word">he should be put out of the synagogue</span>; or, <span class="accented">become unsynagoqued</span>. The Talmud speaks of three kinds of excommunication (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>), of which the first two were disciplinary; the third answers to complete and final expulsion (in 'Jeremiah Moed. K.,' 81, d, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5dc;</span>, Edersheim). The general designation was <span class="accented">shammata</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, to destroy. The first form of it was called <span class="accented">nesephah</span>, and did not amount to more than severe rebuke. It would exclude from religious privileges for seven or thirty days, according to the dignity of the authority by whom it was pronounced (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-1.htm">1 Timothy 5:1</a>). The second form of <span class="accented">shammata</span> was called <span class="accented">niddui</span>, which lasted for thirty days at the least, and might be repeated at the end of them. If these admonitions failed to produce their right effect, it might lead to the third and final excommunication, called <span class="accented">cherem</span>, or ban, whose duration was indefinite. The second of these forms was accompanied by blast of trumpet and terrible curses, which deprived the sufferer of all kinds of social intercourse. He was avoided as a leper; if he died, he was buried without funeral or mourning. The <span class="accented">cherem</span> was even a more terrible anathema, and might last for life. The parents of the blind man might easily fear such a curse. The ban to which this blind man was eventually exposed did not prevent him from moving about the city. The ban pronounced on Jesus led doubtless to the condemnation, issuing in his ignominy and trial for a capital offence. It was probably the second of the three forms of anathema to which he was ultimately condemned. It was quite sufficient temptation for these poor parents to have preserved an obstinate reticence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:18-23 The Pharisees vainly hoped to disprove this notable miracle. They expected a Messiah, but could not bear to think that this Jesus should be he, because his precepts were all contrary to their traditions, and because they expected a Messiah in outward pomp and splendour. The fear of man brings a snare, Pr 29:25, and often makes people deny and disown Christ and his truths and ways, and act against their consciences. The unlearned and poor, who are simple-hearted, readily draw proper inferences from the evidences of the light of the gospel; but those whose desires are another way, though ever learning, never come to the knowledge of the truth.</body></html>
