It was then, as He was leaving the Temple to escape the fury of His enemies who had taken up stones to cast at Him, and was passing by. the place where the blind man was, that His eye fell upon him. The day was the Sabbath of the preceding discourse, now drawing to its close. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>.) The place was probably some spot near the Temple, perhaps one of its gates. We know that beggars were placed near these gates to ask alms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-2.htm" title="And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;">Acts 3:2</a>), and this man was well known as one who sat and begged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-8.htm" title="The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?">John 9:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A man which was blind from his birth.</span>--The fact was well known, and was probably publicly proclaimed by the man himself or his parents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-20.htm" title="His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:">John 9:20</a>) as an aggravation of his misery, and as a plea for the alms of passers by. Of the six miracles connected with blindness which are recorded in the Gospels, this is the only case described as blindness from birth. In this lies its special characteristic, for "since the world began, was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-32.htm" title="Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.">John 9:32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> <span class="accented">The Lord confirms by a sign the declaration that he is the Light of the world</span>, <span class="accented">by giving eyesight as well as light</span>. That which had been proclaimed as a great truth of his Being and mission, viz. that he was the Light of the world, was now to be established and confirmed to the disciples by a signal miracle. The "higher criticism" finds explanation of this and other similar miracles at Bethsaida and Jericho, in the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>. Volkmar holds that the story of Zacchaeus is thus rewritten! Thoma thinks that we have a spiritualization of the "miracle" on Saul of Tarsus. It would be waste time to point out the differences which are patent to the simplest criticism. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> - the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> suggests relation both in subject-matter, in time, place, occasion, and theme, with that which had preceded - <span class="cmt_word">as Jesus was passing by, going along his way, he saw a man blind from birth</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8</a>). He was obviously a well-known beggar, who had often proclaimed the fact that he was blind from birth (see ver. 8). Such a condition and history rendered the cure more difficult and hopeless in the view of ordinary <span class="accented">professors</span> of the healing art, and the juxtaposition of such a symbolic fact with the near activity of those who were boasting of their Abrahamic privilege and their national and mere hereditary advantages, is one of the instances of the unconscious poesy of the gospel history. There he sits, the very type of the race which says, "We <span class="accented">see</span>," but which to Christ's eye was proclaiming its utter helplessness and blindness, not asking even to be illumined, and revealing the fundamental injury done to the very race and nature of man, and calling for all the healing power that he had been sent into the world to dispense. The man who had been struck blind, or whose eyesight had been slowly dosed by disease, became the type of the effect of special sins upon the character and life; thus <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">vanity</span> conceals radical defects and weaknesses; <span class="accented">pride</span> hides from the sinner's own view his own trans<span class="accented">gressions</span>; temporary blindness to great faults is one of the symptoms of <span class="accented">gross sin</span> like David's, and prejudice is proverbially blind and deaf; but here is a man who is nothing less than the type of a congenital bias to evil, of hereditary damage done to human nature. Unless Christ can pour light upon those who are <span class="accented">born</span> blind, he is not the Savior the world needs. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-7 Christ cured many who were blind by disease or accident; here he cured one born blind. Thus he showed his power to help in the most desperate cases, and the work of his grace upon the souls of sinners, which gives sight to those blind by nature. This poor man could not see Christ, but Christ saw him. And if we know or apprehend anything of Christ, it is because we were first known of him. Christ says of uncommon calamities, that they are not always to be looked on as special punishments of sin; sometimes they are for the glory of God, and to manifest his works. Our life is our day, in which it concerns us to do the work of the day. We must be busy, and not waste day-time; it will be time to rest when our day is done, for it is but a day. The approach of death should quicken us to improve all our opportunities of doing and getting good. What good we have an opportunity to do, we should do quickly. And he that will never do a good work till there is nothing to be objected against, will leave many a good work for ever undone, Ec 11:4. Christ magnified his power, in making a blind man to see, doing that which one would think more likely to make a seeing man blind. Human reason cannot judge of the Lord's methods; he uses means and instruments that men despise. Those that would be healed by Christ must be ruled by him. He came back from the pool wondering and wondered at; he came seeing. This represents the benefits in attending on ordinances of Christ's appointment; souls go weak, and come away strengthened; go doubting, and come away satisfied; go mourning, and come away rejoicing; go blind, and come away seeing.</body></html>
