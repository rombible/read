The Pharisees would be still watching our Lord, and some had probably followed the beggar, expecting that our Lord would seek him, and hoping that the interview might furnish some ground for a fresh charge against one or both of them. It is the presence of mental conditions such as theirs and such as his that has brought again to our Lord's thoughts the judicial result of His manifestation, and this rises to His lips as an utterance of the solemn thought that fills His mind. The Pharisees hear this exclamation, and apply to themselves that which their own state suggested; but which was expressed as, and is, a wide law, holding true for all mankind.<p><span class= "bld">Are we blind also?</span>--They misunderstand His words, for He has asserted of the blind ("they which see not") that the result of His coming is "that they might see." But yet they do not understand the words in a physical sense, in which they could have had no application to themselves. Care is required to catch the force of the term in these three verses, and it may be well to distinguish again the meanings attached to the word blind. It is used (1) for physical blindness. This has been its meaning throughout the chapter. It suggests the imagery in these verses, but is not itself present in the thought which is of spiritual, blindness only. (2) For conscious spiritual blindness ("they which see not," "they which think they see not"), which is really the first step to spiritual sight. (3) For unconscious spiritual blindness ("they which see," "they which think they see"), which is really the first step to a total loss of spiritual perception.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Those of the Pharisees who were with him</span>. This expression does not simply mean who were near him at that moment, but who were to a certain extent siding with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-30.htm">John 8:30, 31</a>), while criticizing and rejecting his message; who were incensed with him for promising to them "freedom" and sonship, and whose faith in his claims was of the most superficial and vacillating kind. These wavering, self-satisfied Pharisees <span class="cmt_word">heard these things, and they said to him, Are we blind also</span>? Many commentators, who call attention to the contrast between the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 39, think that the speakers who made use of this word did not draw the distinction, and meant nothing more than their use <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> by of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. But this is unsatisfactory; whatever it 'means in the one clause, it ought to mean in the other. There is a difference between "<span class="accented">becoming blind</span>," and being "the <span class="accented">blind</span>." They ask whether <span class="accented">they</span> are <span class="accented">blind also</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as blind as those who have, according to Christ's own dictum, <span class="accented">become</span> so. They seem to admit that some who have the power of sight have been blinded by the very light that shines upon them, but they are in doubt with reference to their own case. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:39-41 Christ came into the world to give sight to those who were spiritually blind. Also, that those who see might be made blind; that those who have a high conceit of their own wisdom, might be sealed up in ignorance. The preaching of the cross was thought to be folly by such as by carnal wisdom knew not God. Nothing fortifies men's corrupt hearts against the convictions of the word, more than the high opinion which others have of them; as if all that gained applause with men, must obtain acceptance with God. Christ silenced them. But the sin of the self-conceited and self-confident remains; they reject the gospel of grace, therefore the guilt of their sin remains unpardoned, and the power of their sin remains unbroken.</body></html>
