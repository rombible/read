Nothing greater is conceivable in the thought of love. He has spoken of His own love for them as the measure of their love for each other. The thought of this verse dwells upon what His love really was and what theirs should also be. (Comp. especially Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1John 3:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That a man lay down his life for his friends.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that any one . . .</span> For the phrase "lay down his life," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a>. The term "friends" is here used because those whom He is addressing were His friends. There is no opposition between this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm" title="For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.">Romans 5:6</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> The point dwelt upon is the greatness of the love, and the highest reach of love is the self-sacrifice which spares not life itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Greater love than this</span> (love) <span class="cmt_word">no one hath, namely</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">that one should lay down his life for his friends</span>. Meyer and Lange endeavor to maintain even here the telic force of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "The love to you is of so consummate a character, that its object and purpose is seen in my laying down my life for my friends;" and Hengstenberg thinks so because probably a reference here is made to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, that our Lord was pointing to his atoning death - to a death needed alike by enemies and friends. Such an interpretation supposes the lofty purpose of the greatest love. To me, however, it seems more probable that the translation given above places the argument upon a surer; because more common, human, experience. The disposition to die for ungodly and for enemies is exalted by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>) above the self-sacrifice involved in dying for the good. Still, which may be shown, and has often been shown in self-sacrificing death for those who are beloved, whatever other and wider ends may be discerned afterwards and spoken of in other connections, he is here asserting that the love of friendship is quite strong and intense enough to secure such a sacrifice. And he adds - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Those whom God loves as a Father, may despise the hatred of all the world. As the Father loved Christ, who was most worthy, so he loved his disciples, who were unworthy. All that love the Saviour should continue in their love to him, and take all occasions to show it. The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment, but the joy of those who abide in Christ's love is a continual feast. They are to show their love to him by keeping his commandments. If the same power that first shed abroad the love of Christ's in our hearts, did not keep us in that love, we should not long abide in it. Christ's love to us should direct us to love each other. He speaks as about to give many things in charge, yet names this only; it includes many duties.</body></html>
