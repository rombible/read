We are not to interpret these words, as they frequently have been interpreted, of the unbelieving world, or of the Jews; but of Christians in name, who claim to be branches of the true vine. These the Husbandman watcheth day by day; He knoweth them, and readeth the inner realities of their lives, and every one that is fruitless He taketh away.<p><span class= "bld">And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">he cleanseth it.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>.) This means in the natural vine the cutting off of shoots which run to waste, and the removal of every excrescence which hinders the growth of the branch. It means in the spiritual training the checking of natural impulses and affections, and the removal of everything, even though it be by a pang sharp as the edge of the pruner's knife, which can misdirect or weaken the energy of the spiritual life, and thus diminish its fruitfulness. A vine which has been pruned--here a tendril cut off, and there one bent back--here a shoot that seemed of fairest promise to the unskilled eye unsparingly severed by the vine-dresser, who sees it is worthless--here a branch, in itself good, made to yield its place to one that is better, and itself trained to fill another place--such is the familiar picture of the natural vine--such, also, to a wisdom higher than ours, is the picture of human life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every branch in me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this unity of life between me and mine is graciously handled by the Father - my Father! The branches are of two kinds - unfruitful and fruitful. The indefinite statement, in nominative absolute, calls great attention to it. "Every branch in me <span class="cmt_word">that beareth no fruit</span>." Then it is possible to come into this organic relation with the true Vine, to be in it and to be a part of it, and to bring forth <span class="accented">no</span> fruit. If it were not for Ver. 5 we might say that these branches were nations, customs, institutions, and the like; but the context forbids it. The relation to him must therefore be one that is insufficient to secure life, or fruit, or continuance. Baptized, communicating, professing, partially believing Christians there may be in abundance, who, though in him, yet cannot continue in him. (See stony ground, thorny ground, and unripe ears, of the parable of the sower; and the bad fish caught in the net (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He taketh away</span> (cf.

What is done with the valueless prunings is said afterwards. <span class="cmt_word">Every branch that beareth fruit, he pruneth</span> (or, <span class="accented">cleanseth</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that it may bring forth more fruit</span>.

The <span class="accented">suavis rhythmus</span> of Bengel is a mere accidental touch. The words <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> with each other; but the latter word is not connected with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;</span>, a compound of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;</span>, nor is it equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, the true compound of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>; but it is derived from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, clean, and means "to cleanse with libations," and perhaps "to prune with the knife." The Husbandman aims at more fruit, more of meekness, gentleness, love, and faithfulness, in fact, all those <span class="accented">fruits of the Spirit</span> enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, used for "branch" in these verses, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, elsewhere used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-32.htm">Mark 4:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-28.htm">Mark 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm">Romans 11:16-21</a>), means the smaller "branches" of a tree. The term means here vine-branch, the essential constituent elements of the vine itself, and is so used in Aristophanes, AEschines, and Theophrastus (see LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-8 Jesus Christ is the Vine, the true Vine. The union of the human and Divine natures, and the fulness of the Spirit that is in him, resemble the root of the vine made fruitful by the moisture from a rich soil. Believers are branches of this Vine. The root is unseen, and our life is hid with Christ; the root bears the tree, diffuses sap to it, and in Christ are all supports and supplies. The branches of the vine are many, yet, meeting in the root, are all but one vine; thus all true Christians, though in place and opinion distant from each other, meet in Christ. Believers, like the branches of the vine, are weak, and unable to stand but as they are borne up. The Father is the Husbandman. Never was any husbandman so wise, so watchful, about his vineyard, as God is about his church, which therefore must prosper. We must be fruitful. From a vine we look for grapes, and from a Christian we look for a Christian temper, disposition, and life. We must honour God, and do good; this is bearing fruit. The unfruitful are taken away. And even fruitful branches need pruning; for the best have notions, passions, and humours, that require to be taken away, which Christ has promised to forward the sanctification of believers, they will be thankful, for them. The word of Christ is spoken to all believers; and there is a cleansing virtue in that word, as it works grace, and works out corruption. And the more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound in what is good, the more our Lord is glorified. In order to fruitfulness, we must abide in Christ, must have union with him by faith. It is the great concern of all Christ's disciples, constantly to keep up dependence upon Christ, and communion with him. True Christians find by experience, that any interruption in the exercise of their faith, causes holy affections to decline, their corruptions to revive, and their comforts to droop. Those who abide not in Christ, though they may flourish for awhile in outward profession, yet come to nothing. The fire is the fittest place for withered branches; they are good for nothing else. Let us seek to live more simply on the fulness of Christ, and to grow more fruitful in every good word and work, so may our joy in Him and in his salvation be full.</body></html>
