The pronoun is here emphatic. "Whom <span class= "ital">I</span> will send . . ."

He is the Advocate whom the Son will send from the Father, but He is also and emphatically the Spirit of Truth proceeding from the Father, and His witness therefore will be that of the Father Himself. These two clauses ("whom I will send unto you from the Father," "which proceedeth from the Father") are to be regarded as parallels; and both of them probably refer to the <span class= "ital">office</span> of the Holy Spirit. The Vulgate renders the verb in the latter clause by the word "procedit," and the older expositors generally understood it of the <span class= "ital">person</span> of the Holy Ghost. The Eastern Church, from the days of Theodore of Mopsuestia downwards, have claimed this text as proving the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father only, and have quoted it as decisive against the addition of the "filioque clause" in the Nicene Creed. The Western Church, comparing it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-15.htm" title="All things that the Father has are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it to you.">John 16:15</a>, and such texts as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

If it refers to the person of the Holy Spirit, it must be granted that the <span class= "ital">ipsissima verba</span> of our Lord are in favour of the interpretation of the Greek Church; but if it refers, as with much greater probability it does, to the office of the Holy Ghost, then <span class= "ital">these</span> words have no bearing upon the doctrinal question at issue. The student should read on this subject, Pearson <span class= "ital">On the Creed,</span> Art. viii., more particularly his invaluable collection of notes.<p><span class= "bld">He shall testify of me.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">shall bear witness of Me.</span> (Comp.

This is the great text on which the Western Church and the Greeks have alike relied for their doctrine concerning the "procession of the Spirit," the timeless, pre-mundane relations among the Personalities of the Godhead. The expression <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> only occurs in this place, and from it <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> became the ecclesiastical term for the relation which the Holy Spirit sustains to the Father, just as <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> was the especial term to denote the peculiarity of the Son, and just as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the condition of unbegottenness and paternity was that used to denote the Father's own hypostatic distinction. The Holy Spirit is ever proceeding, issuing forth from, sent by the Father on his work of Divine self-manifestation and Divine activity in the universe. Of this there can be no question, and the Nicene symbol originally expressed it without amplification, and the Greeks founded upon it their conception of the Trinity. The relation of the Son and Spirit to the Father were believed to be co-ordinate; and, though both were of the same eternal substance, yet both were equal to the Father. But the Western Church in after-years - notwithstanding the tremendous anathemas against all alteration which guarded the Nicene and Chalcedonian formulae - felt that the whole truth concerning the Divinity of the Son was concealed, if the idea was not also conveyed which our Lord utters side by side with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in this verse. Christ says, "I will send him <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>," and this must be compared with (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>), "whom the Father will send in my Name;" and the Latins, to express this thought, added <span class="accented">filioque</span> to the phrase, "proceeding from the Father," and claimed our Lord as equally the Source of the Divine Spirit with the Father, so that it runs, "proceeding from the Father and the Son." In the endless discussions that arose, the two Churches probably meant to effect the same thing, viz. to affirm the glory and perfect Deity of the Lord Christ. The Greeks, in ancient times, never limited their statement to proceeding from the Father <span class="accented">only</span>;" nor did they object to add, "through or by the Son;" but it is probable that Augustine and the Western Church, and the liturgical forms that arose in it, approach a little more closely to the reality and quality of him who said, "I and my Father are one" in this respect, that the Spirit proceedeth from the Father and Son, when he comes into human hearts and testifies of Christ. There are those (Beza, Luthardt, Alford, Meyer) who urge that these passages do not bear at all upon the internal relations of the Godhead, but simply refer to the temporal mission of the Holy Spirit. "The words," says Luthardt, "must be understood historically, not metaphysically," and much may be said in favor of this view. If this verse does not furnish the basis of an argument, there is no other which can be advanced to establish the view either of the Eastern or Western Church. The witness of the Paraclete is said here to cover the gravest difficulties and provide the richest consolations. If the Lord intended to teach the fundamental nature of the Holy Spirit, the literal statement would be a powerful defense of the Greek doctrine; but if the passage here speaks of the official work and temporal mission, the words have no direct bearing upon that doctrine. The <span class="accented">denial</span> of the <span class="accented">filioque</span> has the logical tendency to make the Spirit and Son co-ordinate and subordinate emanations of the Father, and so to go back to the monarchianism from which the Church escaped at Nicaea. (See Pearson on the Creed, art. 8; 'Dict. Christian Biography,' art. "Holy Ghost;" Smeaten, 'Doctrine of the Holy Spirit;' Hagenbach, 'History of Christian Doctrines.') The supernatural power of the Holy Spirit will counteract the hatred in the world by regenerating individuals within it. More than that, said Christ, he (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) will bear witness to me, in the Divine strength and courage which he will give to you, in the new and corrective ideas which he will supply, in the great works seen to be mine, which you will have grace to initiate (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> , - passages where the "Acts of the Apostles" are seen to be "Acts of the Risen Jesus"); and <span class="accented">ye also bear witness</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. Your own experience of me from the commencement of my ministry will give you a class of testimony which will leave an indelible impression on the heart of the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:26,27.
