The brightness of that joy lit up the darkest hours of His own human life, and He wills that it should light up theirs. In the consciousness of their love to God, and of God's love to them, there would be in them, as part of their true life, joy which no sorrow could ever overcome. They were as men with troubled hearts. He has told them of the true source of peace. His own peace He has given to them. He tells them now of the source of joy, and has spoken the word that they may possess the very joy which was the light of His own heart.<p><span class= "bld">And that your joy might be full.</span>--Comp. the words of the Intercessory Prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-13.htm" title="And now come I to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.">John 17:13</a>, and the same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm" title="Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.">John 16:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-4.htm" title="And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full.">1John 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-12.htm" title="Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.">2John 1:12</a>. The state of which He has spoken to them--the loving and being loved of God--is the ideal perfection of human life. It supplies satisfaction for all the deepest desires of our being. The capacities of the whole man are fulfilled in it, and the result is fulness of joy. They have learnt little of the true spirit of Christianity whose religion does not impart to them a joy which sheds its light over the whole of their lives.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11</span> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-6.htm">John 16:6</a>. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The <span class="accented">results of the union between Christ and his disciples</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-16.</span> - (a) <span class="accented">To themselves</span>. The Lord moves into another and wider development of the union between himself and his disciples. He drops the metaphor of the vine and the branches, and comes to the essence of the relation between them; that is, he does much to explain the meaning and nature of his abiding in them, and the character of the fruit which they were expected by the great Husbandman and Father to bring forth and ripen. A connection between the second section and the first is revealed in the new beginning. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things I have spoken, and am still speaking, to you</span> (perfect, not aorist) with this purpose, <span class="cmt_word">that the joy that is mine may be</span> <span class="cmt_word">in you</span>. This is variously explained. Augustine, "My joyfulness concerning you," which is scarcely the burden of the previous verses; Grotius, "Your delight in me," which would be somewhat tautologous; Calvin and De Wette, "The joyfulness capable of being produced in you by me, might be in you." But the words are more simply explained by Lange, Meyer, Lucke, Westcott, Alford, and Moulton, as the communication to his disciples of his own absolute and personal joy. "The joy that is mine," like "the peace which is mine," is graciously bestowed. A joy was set before him, the joy of perfect self-sacrifice, which gave to his present acts an intensity and fullness of bliss. It was this, in its motives and character and supernatural sweetness, which would be in them. If they receive his life into them, it will convey not only his <span class="accented">peace</span>, but that peace uprising and bursting into joy; and he adds, <span class="cmt_word">in order that your joy may be fulfilled</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. <span class="cmt_word"></span>perfected</span>, reach its highest expression, its fullness of contents and entire sufficiency for all needs. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-4</a> is the best commentary on this last clause. The Old Testament prophets had often spoken of Jehovah's joy in his people, comparing it to the bridegroom's joy, and the bride's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>). This entire idea is linked with Ver. 10; where the keeping of his commandments, from motives of love, will enable the disciples to "abide in his love." He now passes the whole law of the second table into the light of his joy and the power of his example. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Those whom God loves as a Father, may despise the hatred of all the world. As the Father loved Christ, who was most worthy, so he loved his disciples, who were unworthy. All that love the Saviour should continue in their love to him, and take all occasions to show it. The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment, but the joy of those who abide in Christ's love is a continual feast. They are to show their love to him by keeping his commandments. If the same power that first shed abroad the love of Christ's in our hearts, did not keep us in that love, we should not long abide in it. Christ's love to us should direct us to love each other. He speaks as about to give many things in charge, yet names this only; it includes many duties.</body></html>
