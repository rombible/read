Apart from this revelation, their sin would have belonged to the times of ignorance, which God overlooked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/17-30.htm" title="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:">Acts 17:30-31</a>). It would have been the negative evil of men who know not. It was now the positive evil of men who, knowing the truth, wilfully reject it.<p><span class= "bld">But now they have no cloke for their sin.</span>--Better, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">they have no excuse for their sin.</span> The Greek phrase occurs only here in the New Testament. The word "cloke" as used with sin is familiar to us from the exhortation in the Book of Common Prayer. The idea is rather to cover up, to hide as with a garment, so that they may not be seen; whereas here the idea is of excuse for manifest sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I had not come,</span> as the incarnate Word of God, if I had not fulfilled the promises and come forth from God into the world to reveal the Father, <span class="cmt_word">and spoken to them</span>, made known to them the thought and Spirit of God, made it possible for them to know the essence of the only true God, <span class="cmt_word">they had had</span> <span class="cmt_word">no sin</span>; they would not have resisted the highest love, their alienation in this respect would not have been a violation of the most solemn and gracious demands of the Father. The greatest sin is the refusal of the most complete revelation, and by the side of this all other sin becomes comparatively trivial. Our Lord could not have spoken of the hatred of himself or his disciples (so Lucke and Meyer) as this sin, because it would have been obviously impossible to hate a non-existent revelation or revealer. It is the deeper fall which is consequent upon a deliberate rejection of the highest love. Formerly, they would have been in the condition of those whose sins of ignorance God overlooks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>), and to whose <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in the past God has exercised <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in anticipation of the coming grace. <span class="cmt_word">But now</span> (Luke in numerous places uses this expression to form a strong contrast) <span class="cmt_word">they have no excuse</span> or pretext <span class="cmt_word">for their sin</span>, or concerning their sin. They can plead no justification. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and is not "cloak or covering," but "<span class="accented">palliation</span> or excuse" for manifest sin. So long as men have seen no deeper into the nature of God than they can go with the aid of mere phenomena or ratiocination on the details of creation, their fears and even their hatreds formulated into grim legend, or uncouth idols, or repellent hypothesis, are a natural outcome of a nature so corrupt; but they ought to have found in Christ a deeper revelation, a summons to service and adoring love. In rejecting the idea of God which I have set before them they have no excuse. St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>) declares that those who have defamed the great characteristic of God which may be learned from nature are without excuse. Certainly our Lord does not say this here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:18-25 How little do many persons think, that in opposing the doctrine of Christ as our Prophet, Priest, and King, they prove themselves ignorant of the one living and true God, whom they profess to worship! The name into which Christ's disciples were baptized, is that which they will live and die by. It is a comfort to the greatest sufferers, if they suffer for Christ's name's sake. The world's ignorance is the true cause of its hatred to the disciples of Jesus. The clearer and fuller the discoveries of the grace and truth of Christ, the greater is our sin if we do not love him and believe in him.</body></html>
