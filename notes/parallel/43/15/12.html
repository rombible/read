He now reminds them that that which was specially the commandment to them was love to one another. Love to God is proved by love to mankind. The two great commandments of the law are really one. "If a man love not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I loved you.</span> This (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>) was given as a "new commandment;" now he gathers the many commandments into <span class="accented">one</span>, as though all were included in it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>). This thought is further vindicated by an endeavor to explain in what sense and way he was loving them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Those whom God loves as a Father, may despise the hatred of all the world. As the Father loved Christ, who was most worthy, so he loved his disciples, who were unworthy. All that love the Saviour should continue in their love to him, and take all occasions to show it. The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment, but the joy of those who abide in Christ's love is a continual feast. They are to show their love to him by keeping his commandments. If the same power that first shed abroad the love of Christ's in our hearts, did not keep us in that love, we should not long abide in it. Christ's love to us should direct us to love each other. He speaks as about to give many things in charge, yet names this only; it includes many duties.</body></html>
