For the word "servant," as applied to them, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm" title="If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.">John 12:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-13.htm" title="You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.">John 13:13</a>. It is used again in this discourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-20.htm" title="Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.">John 15:20</a>), but with reference to an earlier saying. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>, he calls them brethren. The word here rendered "servant" means literally "bond-servant," "slave." He will not apply this to them, but the foremost Apostles felt that His service was perfect freedom, and it became the common title which they applied to themselves. (Comp., <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.</span>--The part of the slave is mechanical obedience, without any principle of love between his master and himself. He knows nothing of the purpose or aim of his master, and although he sees the deeds which are done, he knows not what his master doeth. There is no occasion to read the word "doeth" as though it were "will do" (future), which has not unfrequently been accepted as the explanation.<p><span class= "bld">For all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> He had treated them as friends and sharers in their common work. He has revealed to them the character and attributes of the Father, and kept back from them no truth of which they could understand the meaning. There is no contradiction with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm" title="I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.">John 16:12</a>. The reason He had not told them more was not on His part, but on theirs. They could not then receive more, but in the future He would by the Holy Spirit declare to them all truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No longer do I call you servants,</span> bond-slaves. True, he had in this very discourse spoken of them as his <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13, 16</a>). Again and again in his parabolic teaching he had spoken of his disciples as servants of a Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-27.htm">Matthew 13:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-4.htm">Matthew 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>, where another word is used). And moreover, later on in this very chapter (Ver. 20), the word and thought return, so that this relation to him, gloried in by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>), St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>), Jude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>), and even St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>), could be sustained in its integrity, even after it had been transfigured, and penetrated through and through with the light of love. <span class="cmt_word">Because the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.</span> The slave is an instrument, doing by commandment, not from intimate knowledge, his Lord's behests. <span class="cmt_word">But you I have called</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) - on previous occasions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>, "Our friend Lazarus") - <span class="cmt_word">friends</span>, for whom it is joy to die, and I have effected the transfiguration of your service into love. I have raised you by the intimacy of the relations into which 1 have drawn you from the position of slave to that of friend. You may be, you must be, my servants still; I am your Master and Lord; but you will be servants from a higher motive and a more enduring link and bond of union. <span class="cmt_word">For all things which I heard of my Father.</span> Notice the source of the Savior's teaching. He was sent from God, trained and taught, as a man; he chose thus, humanly, to learn step by step, thing by thing, what to reveal of his own nature, of his purpose and plan in redeeming men, concerning the essence of the Father himself, and the entire significance of his self-manifestation. That which I heard <span class="cmt_word">I made known unto you.</span> This is only in apparent contradiction with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12</a>, where he implies that there will be more for them to learn in the future, when the mystery of his death, resurrection, and ascension shall have been accomplished. The limitation of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> does not consist in <span class="accented">doctrines</span> as opposed to practical <span class="accented">duties</span>, nor in the plan of salvation for individuals as antithetic to principles of his kingdom, nor in principles as distinguished from what may ultimately be found in them, but in the capacities and circumstances of the disciples themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12</a> is a corollary of this solemn assurance). The reason of the present assertion is the proof that it thus supplies of their dearness to him. "Ye are my friends." He had told them all that they could <span class="accented">bear</span>. He had lifted the veil high enough for their truest joy and noblest discipline. He had bared his heart to them. He had kept back nothing that was profitable. He had proved his own friendship, and thus given a conclusive reason for his complete self-devotion on their account. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Those whom God loves as a Father, may despise the hatred of all the world. As the Father loved Christ, who was most worthy, so he loved his disciples, who were unworthy. All that love the Saviour should continue in their love to him, and take all occasions to show it. The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment, but the joy of those who abide in Christ's love is a continual feast. They are to show their love to him by keeping his commandments. If the same power that first shed abroad the love of Christ's in our hearts, did not keep us in that love, we should not long abide in it. Christ's love to us should direct us to love each other. He speaks as about to give many things in charge, yet names this only; it includes many duties.</body></html>
