That love is to correspond with his love to the disciples, and to explain his self-sacrifice to them; he proves to them that they are his "friends," and therefore the objects of his dying love. Then the appeal is still further clenched by showing the origin and purport of his friendship for them. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did not choose me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> are middle, "you chose... I chose... for yourselves or for myself"), <span class="cmt_word">but I chose you</span>. I selected you as individuals, not excluding thereby a gracious choice of other souls; I destined you to accomplish work dear to me and essential to my kingdom. Christ has already told them that he must "go away" from' them to the Father, and that they "cannot follow him now, but afterwards;" and he has also convinced them that, though he go away, he will "come again, and abide with them," and also that "severed" from him they can "do nothing." Consequently when he adds, <span class="cmt_word">I appointed you</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, for similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) as my apostles and representatives, to do work in my Name, there is no contradiction in his adding, <span class="cmt_word">that ye should go forth</span>, depart into the world with my message and in my Name, as I am "departing" to the Father, to rule over you from a higher and more august position. <span class="cmt_word">And bear fruit.</span> A passing reference to the imagery of the first part of the chapter, showing that their "going forth <span class="accented">or</span> away" upon this mission would not separate them from his Spirit, or divide the link without which they could bear no fruit at all. The "fruit" may here, in its issues, suggest another class of ideas. In the first case the "fruit" was the "fruit of the Spirit," but here it would seem to be the abiding consequence of the "greater works" which they would be called upon to do. This rich fruit includes all the victories they were to win over souls, and all the effects of their ministry. "Fruit" in either case is only valuable when it is utilized by the Husbandman and according to his purpose. "Fruit" is a Divine self-exhaustion of the living organism; it does no good to the branch nor to the stem; it is the sacred property of the husbandman, whether for his own joy or for fresh seed. In this case <span class="cmt_word">your fruit will abide for ever</span>, not in the branch, but in the Father's hands, <span class="cmt_word">that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my Name, he may give it you</span>. It now becomes a question whether the second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> introduces a clause which is co-ordinate with the former or one logically depending on the preceding. Meyer concludes the first, viz. that the granting of prayer brings about the fruit and its continuance (so De Wette, Lucke, Stier, Godet); and Olshausen maintains the second, viz. that by going and bringing forth fruit we enter into that relation with God from which proceeds the prayer in the name of the Son which the Father will grant, thus bringing the passage into close relation with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13</a> and John 16:23. Hengstenberg says, "By their fruit they would show themselves to be true disciples of Christ, and to such the Father can deny nothing." But Westcott and Lange endeavor to combine both ideas. The co-ordination of the two clauses requires the inversion of their order, or the introduction of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> before the second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>. Moreover, the thought that Christ chose and appointed them in order that whatsoever they should ask God would give, is out of harmony with "the conditions of acceptable prayer" elsewhere insisted on; while the bearing of fruit - in both senses, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that of Christian grace and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Christian usefulness = - completes the idea in a concrete form of abiding in Christ and having His Words abiding in them. Surely the view that the Second clause is conditioned by the First, is far from obscure, as Luthardt Says, while He virtually accepts the same interpretatio," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm">John 16:24</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Those whom God loves as a Father, may despise the hatred of all the world. As the Father loved Christ, who was most worthy, so he loved his disciples, who were unworthy. All that love the Saviour should continue in their love to him, and take all occasions to show it. The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment, but the joy of those who abide in Christ's love is a continual feast. They are to show their love to him by keeping his commandments. If the same power that first shed abroad the love of Christ's in our hearts, did not keep us in that love, we should not long abide in it. Christ's love to us should direct us to love each other. He speaks as about to give many things in charge, yet names this only; it includes many duties.</body></html>
