It was in the eternal love of the Father, ever going forth to the Son, and from the Son ever going forth to all who would receive it. The Father's love and presence was ever with the Son, because the Son ever did those things which were pleasing to Him. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a>.) The love of the Son is ever present wherever willing heart of obedient disciple is open to its power.<p><span class= "bld">Continue ye in my love.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">abide ye in My love.</span> The word "continue" misses the connection with the context. By "My love" is meant, not "love to Me in your hearts," but, "My love towards you." The one produces the other. "We love Him because He hath first loved us;" but that which is prominent in the thought here is His love to the disciples, which He has just compared to the Father's love to Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Two ways of explaining this verse: <span class="accented">Even as - inasmuch as - the Father hath loved me</span>, <span class="accented">and as I have loved you</span>, <span class="accented">abide in my love</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as Grotius has put it, the first clause suggesting accordance with the mystery of the Trinity, and the second the mystery of redemption: "So do ye continue, or so do ye abide, in the amplitude of this double love which is mine, dwell in it as in a holy atmosphere, breathe it and live by it." But there is another and more satisfactory way of translating the passage<span class="cmt_word">: Even as the Father loved me, I also loved you</span>; a fact of stupendous interest and transcendent claim. Heaven had opened over the incarnate Word, and other ears as well as his own had heard the Father say, "Thou art my beloved Son," etc. The Lord was conscious of being the Object of this infinite love before the foundation of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>), and of reciprocating and responding to it; and this love of the Father to him on his assumption of his mediatorial functions was the well-spring of his obedience unto death and after it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>, note). Now, if the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is to be translated as above, Christ declares that <span class="accented">even as</span> the Father has loved him, he has' loved his disciples. Again and again he has emphasized this love to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>), but here he asserts a loftier claim, viz. that his love to them corresponds with the eternal Father's love to himself. The one great fact is the ground on which he commands them to <span class="accented">abide in his love</span>. This is obviously a more explicit and more intelligible form of the commandment to abide in him. With Olshausen and Westcott, "The love that is mine "is not the love to Christ, nor the love <span class="accented">of</span> Christ exclusively, but a blending of the active and passive idea in "the love that is mine" - in the "love" lavished upon me from eternity, and to which I have eternally responded, which I have made known to you and expended on you and received back again from you. <span class="cmt_word">Abide in that love that is mine.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Those whom God loves as a Father, may despise the hatred of all the world. As the Father loved Christ, who was most worthy, so he loved his disciples, who were unworthy. All that love the Saviour should continue in their love to him, and take all occasions to show it. The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment, but the joy of those who abide in Christ's love is a continual feast. They are to show their love to him by keeping his commandments. If the same power that first shed abroad the love of Christ's in our hearts, did not keep us in that love, we should not long abide in it. Christ's love to us should direct us to love each other. He speaks as about to give many things in charge, yet names this only; it includes many duties.</body></html>
