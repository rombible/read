It would love not them, but that in them which was its own. (Comp.

There He had told them that the world could not hate them. The very fact of its hatred would prove a moral change in them, by which they had ceased to belong to the world, and had become the children of God. Both thoughts are repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-13.htm" title="Marvel not, my brothers, if the world hate you.">1John 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-5.htm" title="They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world hears them.">1John 4:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye were of the world</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> still a part of it, deriving your life, maxims, and pleasures from it; if you could sympathize with its vulgar passion, and its temporary fleeting excitements, partisanships, and bigotries - <span class="cmt_word">the world would be loving</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;</span>, notice the form of the conditional sentence, a supposition contrary to fact, therefore anticipating the negative clause that follows, "but ye are not of the world;" notice also that <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;</span>, the love of affection, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, the love of reverence and profound regard, which you are to show to one another and to me) - would be loving <span class="cmt_word">its own</span>.

Just in proportion as you are one with me, you draw upon yourself its hatred of me. "The offence of the cross" is not ceased. Thoma comments on the harmony between this statement and that of the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse, whose colors and features are here, as he thinks, drawn upon. It is profoundly interesting to trace the fulfillment of the Lord's prescient words in earlier Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-17.htm">Galatians 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:18-25 How little do many persons think, that in opposing the doctrine of Christ as our Prophet, Priest, and King, they prove themselves ignorant of the one living and true God, whom they profess to worship! The name into which Christ's disciples were baptized, is that which they will live and die by. It is a comfort to the greatest sufferers, if they suffer for Christ's name's sake. The world's ignorance is the true cause of its hatred to the disciples of Jesus. The clearer and fuller the discoveries of the grace and truth of Christ, the greater is our sin if we do not love him and believe in him.</body></html>
