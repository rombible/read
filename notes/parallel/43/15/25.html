The Greek follows the LXX., which expresses the thought "to no purpose," or "in vain." This is, however, not the idea of the context here. They had no reason for their sin, and therefore they hated Him without a cause. True were these words of many an earlier sufferer; but they were in their fulness true, they were "fulfilled," only in the one sinless Sufferer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - Strange is it that even here the ancient psalmist, in portraying the ideal Sufferer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>), bad seized this feature, and thus anticipated the treatment of the Son of God. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="accented">this</span> <span class="accented">cometh</span> to pass (some clause of this kind must be introduced to give true force to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that the word might be fulfilled that has been written in their Law.</span> Not only here but elsewhere Jesus speaks of the Psalms as a part of the Law (see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-34.htm">John 10:34</a>). Other passages may, from their similarity, have been in Christ's mind, as receiving fulfillment or abundant illustration in their conduct. The use of the expression, "the Law," has been pressed by many as proof that the writer of this Gospel did not regard himself as a Jew at all. Such numerous indications occur of the opposite conclusion, that this expression must receive the more rational interpretation - the Law in which they pride themselves, the Law which is ever in their mouths, the Law which itself contains the portraiture of their spirit: <span class="cmt_word">They hated me gratuitously</span>; <span class="accented">causelessly</span>. The true Christ was, when he came, the object of reason-less, causeless hate and opposition. Jesus knew, when he claimed to be the Christ, that he would have to complete and fulfill the solemn portraiture of the suffering, burden-bearing, and rejected Christ, as well as that of the triumphant Christ and King. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:18-25 How little do many persons think, that in opposing the doctrine of Christ as our Prophet, Priest, and King, they prove themselves ignorant of the one living and true God, whom they profess to worship! The name into which Christ's disciples were baptized, is that which they will live and die by. It is a comfort to the greatest sufferers, if they suffer for Christ's name's sake. The world's ignorance is the true cause of its hatred to the disciples of Jesus. The clearer and fuller the discoveries of the grace and truth of Christ, the greater is our sin if we do not love him and believe in him.</body></html>
