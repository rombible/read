The pronoun is the emphatic word: "<span class= "ital">Thou,</span> who art <span class= "ital">thou?"</span> and the phrase was in frequent use to express contempt. He had said, "I am;" but they do not understand the words to be a divine name. Long before this time the name formed from these words, and which is now usually, but wrongly, read "Jehovah," had been regarded as too sacred to be uttered. They appear to take the sentence as though it was incomplete, "I am . . .;" "Well, who art thou?" We have again, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-19.htm" title="Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a>, to note the attempt to draw from Him some definite statement which may be made the ground of a technical charge; but this He again avoids.<p><span class= "bld">And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</span>--Almost every word of this answer is in the Greek capable of more than one meaning, and the true interpretation of the whole sentence cannot be decided with certainty. To discuss it with any fulness would be to encumber the page with details which would be unintelligible to the general reader; to discuss it with anything but fulness would be unsatisfactory to the student. There is little room for addition to the investigations which are now accessible. The full notes of Meyer and Stier and Tholuck may be read in English; and Dr. Moulton's addition to his Translation of Winer's <span class= "ital">Grammar</span> (eighth edition, 1877, pp. 581-2), gives in a few words nearly all that can be said on the grammatical difficulty. After a careful consideration of the whole matter, it is believed, though not without hesitation, that the rendering, which is least liable to objection on any ground, is that which regards the answer as itself a question--"What I from the beginning am also speaking to you?" "You ask who I am. This has formed the substance of My teaching from the beginning, and is the substance of My teaching still." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>.) "Can it be that you ask this?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said they to him</span> - the hostile Jerusalem party - in scornful mockery, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Who art thou?</span> "Define thyself more closely; make thy claims clear and categorical. Give now a direct answer to a plain question." It is very remarkable that the Lord often refuses to respond in the precise form in which his interlocutors demand an answer. He sees the multitudinous sides of every truth, and frequently gives to his questioners the means of answering their question from the ground of deep spiritual conviction, rather than furnishes them with a formula which might easily be abused. <span class="accented">Who art thou?</span> How profoundly pathetic! How confirmatory of his own words, "Ye have not known me, nor my Father"! The reply which our Lord gave to the question has occasioned greater variety of interpretation than, perhaps, any other sentence in the Gospel: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (or <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,) <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. The meaning of the words taken separately is disputable; the relation to the context has been very variously understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The sentence may be taken interrogatively: <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> regarded adverbially in the sense of "at all," and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in the sense of "why?" which is perhaps justified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-11.htm">Mark 9:11, 28</a>. So that it might mean, <span class="accented">Why do I even speak with you at all?</span> This is the interpretation of the ancient Greek Fathers, Cyril and Chrysostom; is preferred by Lucke ('Comm.,' 2:301-313); and with slight modifications is adopted by Ewald (who gives it more the form of an exclamation, "How is it that I should have to speak to you at all!" [this rendering is put in the margin of R.T.], Westcott and Moulton (see note to Winer, 'Grammar of New Testament,' pp. 581, 582), Matthai, and others. Meyer has differed somewhat in successive editions, but (4th edit.) translates, "What I from the beginning am also speaking to you (do ye ask)?" Can you still be asking concerning that which I have been from the beginning saying to you, viz. "Who I am"? This interpretation is singularly obscure. It turns on the fact that, except in some virtually negative sentences, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> cannot have the force of "at all," and falls back on the conclusion that it must, when used adverbially, have the force of "from the first." Lucke devotes great space to the proof from classical Greek that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> never means <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="accented">omnino, except</span> in association with a negative sentence, and he discusses the four exceptions to this supposed rule which some grammarians have discovered in secular Greek (Lennep. 'Ap. Phalarid.,' pp. 82, 55, and 92), and thereupon, in a different way from Meyer, endeavours to supply the negative conception. In reply to Meyer, it is fair to say that Christ had not been constantly announcing in categorical terms who he was and is; and further, that the rendering practically introduces a clause, "do ye ask," which is not in the text; moreover, its rendering transforms <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Many have advocated an affirmative rendering. Augustine (with Lampe and Fritzsche) takes <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> as the <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> of the universe, the <span class="accented">principium</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>), and translates," Believe that I am the <span class="accented">Principium</span> (the Logos), because I am also speaking with you (because, humbled on your account, I have descended to such words as these)." Chrysostom and Nonnus (who turned the Gospel into Greek hexameters) associate the sentence with what follows; thus: "I, the <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, who also speak to you, have many things to say and judge of you." The accusative form is thus set at nought. Calvin takes <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> as equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "from the beginning" (so that the meaning would be, "I did not arise suddenly, but as I was formerly promised, so now I come forth publicly"), "<span class="accented">because I also speak with you."</span> In other words, "What I now speak is in accordance with the conditions made in all ages 'from the beginning.' So Delitzsch, Hebrew version of New Testament. Luthardt seems to approach this view, which he makes more difficult by insisting that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> does not mean "from" but "at the beginning." The view of Winer, Grimm, Alford, Stier, Godet, Thoma, and Plummer, is substantially the same, giving to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> the sense of <span class="accented">omnino. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Essentially</span>, <span class="accented">wholly, altogether</span> (<span class="cmt_word">I am</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that which even I am saying to you.</span> The grammatical objection that this use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> demands a negative sentence in classic Greek, is not conclusive. This is the only place in the New Testament where the word is used adverbially, and it is in reply to a mocking question which has much virtual negative in it. Green ('Critical Notes') urges that the sense of "altogether" (<span class="accented">omnino</span>) was preserved in all kinds of sentences without distinction. He does not prove it, but it is entirely probable that it might have this force in New Testament Greek. The great advantage of the rendering is that it brings the answer into relation with the entire previous discourse, in which Christ's testimony to himself had been disputed because (in the opinion of those who were debating with him) that testimony had not been adequately supported. "I am the Revelation of the Father, the Messenger from heaven, the Bread of God, the Light of the world - essentially that which I am saying to you." Believe my own testimony thus far, and that will answer the query, "Who art thou?" There is no great distinction between this view and that of De Wette: "Von vorne herein (vor allen Dingen) bin ich was ich auch zu euch rede," as Bruckner put it - "From the beginning, from the first, (I am) what I am also saying to you." Winer's view seems to me the best. Grimm thus translates: "Omnino, hoc est sine ulla exceptione sum, quod etiam vobis eloquor, non solum sum, sed etiam vobis, praedico id quod sum." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:21-29 Those that live in unbelief, are for ever undone, if they die in unbelief. The Jews belonged to this present evil world, but Jesus was of a heavenly and Divine nature, so that his doctrine, kingdom, and blessings, would not suit their taste. But the curse of the law is done away to all that submit to the grace of the gospel. Nothing but the doctrine of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, and none but the Spirit of Christ's grace will be an agent powerful enough, to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, and that doctrine is given, to work upon those only who believe in Christ. Some say, Who is this Jesus? They allow him to have been a Prophet, an excellent Teacher, and even more than a creature; but cannot acknowledge him as over all, God blessed for evermore. Will not this suffice? Jesus here answers the question. Is this to honour him as the Father? Does this admit his being the Light of the world, and the Life of men, one with the Father? All shall know by their conversion, or in their condemnation, that he always spake and did what pleased the Father, even when he claimed the highest honours to himself.</body></html>
