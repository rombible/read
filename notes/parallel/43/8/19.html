"You speak of two witnesses. We accept you as one. Where is the other? He should be present before us if his evidence is to be accepted." They must have known well from the earlier discourse that He claimed God as His Father, and the recurring phrase, "the Father that sent Me," must have now made this clear. We are not to read in these words, then, any reference to a father in the flesh, though this interpretation is that of many ancient and modern expositors. The question, moreover, is not, "Who is Thy Father?" but "Where is Thy Father?" The question is asked in another spirit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a>.<p>It may be that to their scorn is added the desire to draw from Him express words on which to base an accusation. They perhaps expect an answer such as "My Father who is in heaven." (Comp. the direct question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-24.htm" title="Then came the Jews round about him, and said to him, How long do you make us to doubt? If you be the Christ, tell us plainly.">John 10:24</a>, and the adjuration of the high priest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-64.htm" title="Command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.">Matthew 27:64</a>.) But the time has not yet come. His answer contains no words which they could lay hold of as a technical ground for blasphemy.<p><span class= "bld">Ye neither know me, nor my Father.</span>--He traces their ignorance of the Father to its true cause, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to their neglect of the only means by which God could be known. This thought has met us already in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a> (see Note there), and will meet us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?">John 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm" title="And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.">John 16:3</a>. Here the Pharisees think they know Him, and ask "Where is Thy Father?" The answer is. that if they really knew the witness of one, they would know the witness of both.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said to him</span>, in angry, wilful irony, <span class="cmt_word">Where is thy Father? -</span> that he may bear to thee the witness which thou art appropriating. "Thou hast freed thyself from the charge of bearing unsupported testimony to thyself, by assuming the coordinate testimony of thy Father? Let thy Father manifest himself!" There is no need to explain this of the absence or insignificance of the earthly father of Jesus, or to suppose that they looked for some human attestation of such a kind (Augustine, Lange). They rather scoffed at his claim of unique relation to the Father, and asked with mockery," <span class="accented">Where is</span> he?" not "<span class="accented">Who</span> or <span class="accented">what</span> is he?" What proof has he given of any special relation to thee? <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span> this taunt with sublime patience and pity, with distress at the resolute and judicial blindness they were fastening upon themselves: <span class="cmt_word">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.</span> Another stupendous utterance, implying the most intimate relation between his own personality and the Father's. Any fair or adequate knowledge of himself must reveal to them that he is in the Father and the Father in him; must bring forth to their consciences the overshadowing presence, the Divine glory. "You are wrapping yourself in impenetrable mists; you are refusing the light of life, and all the evidence given to you that I am the Light of the world. You do not see less recondite truths, nor perceive ideas far more elementary still; you cannot, in your spiritual blindness, apprehend the outline of my human character. If you had done this, you would have known my Father at least enough to prevent the utterance of so crude and disheartening a query. You know me not: why should I talk to you? All this ministry of mine has left me, so far as you Pharisees are concerned, perfectly unknown." There is awful severity and unutterable pathos in these closing words of the discourse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:17-20 If we knew Christ better, we should know the Father better. Those become vain in their imaginations concerning God, who will not learn of Christ. Those who know not his glory and grace, know not the Father that sent him. The time of our departure out of the world, depends upon God. Our enemies cannot hasten it any sooner, nor can our friends delay it any longer, than the time appointed of the Father. Every true believer can look up and say with pleasure, My times are in thy hand, and better there than in my own. To all God's purposes there is a time.</body></html>
