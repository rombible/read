This seems unnatural, and is opposed to the words which immediately follow. As a party, they had been, and still were, seeking to kill Him. These believers, by their question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33</a>, were showing the spirit which declined discipleship, were identifying themselves with His opponents.<p><span class= "bld">Because my word hath no place in you.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">makes no progress in you,</span> "does not advance, does not gain ground in you."

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a> the test was, "If ye abide in My word." Their question proves that their faith was momentary. The word had but penetrated the surface of their thoughts, but they had not so received it as to allow it to advance into the mind and influence their conduct.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, I know absolutely, I do not come to know it from your retort) <span class="cmt_word">that ye are the seed of Abraham.</span> They belonged to the noble race, "whose are the fathers;" they were the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of him who received the promises. Christ admitted the pedigree, but he proceeds to show that mere hereditary descent would be of no avail to them apart from moral considerations. These ideas, these revolutionary conceptions, so far as Judaism was concerned, were not the evolution of Christian ideas in the second century. It is most instructive to see how clearly St. Paul had already grasped them, and woven them into a powerful argument when dealing with the Judaizers in Galatia, many years before this Gospel was written (see the entire argument of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3.htm">Galatians 3</a>, which thus rests on the teaching of the Christ himself). <span class="cmt_word">But ye seek to kill me.</span> This charge is certainly difficult to suppose applicable to those who "had come to believe in him" (ver. 31). One of three suppositions must be made - either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the believing Jews were surrounded by angry groups of his bitter enemies, to whom he here addressed himself; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the Lord spoke here to them as representing the large company of Jerusalem opponents, whom he knew at that moment to be planning his death, and as all orators and debaters are in the habit of dealing with opposing arguments by showing the character they assume in others, who make them their boast; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> those who had come to believe him up to a certain point had as rapidly relapsed, at the first touch of spiritual proof, into disbelief and cruel hostility. This seems the more natural interpretation of the fact, which may, at the same time, have become patent from some angry manifestation of his implacable foes. There is much to be found in the background and scenery of this dramatic colloquy, reported with such extreme brevity, which would, if we exactly knew how to paint it, solve its difficulties. Ye seek to slay me, <span class="cmt_word">because my word</span> - the word which is mine - <span class="cmt_word">makes no progress</span> - or, <span class="accented">advance</span> - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in you.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> has both transitive and intransitive meanings; thus it means "leave," "depart," "turn," or "come to," with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, "contain;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-2.htm">Mark 2:2</a>); but it has the force frequently in Plato "to make progress or advance," and it has this force here. So Meyer, Westcott, R.T., etc. (Luthardt and Tholuck suggest "find entrance," which would require <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>). Not only did they not <span class="accented">continue</span> in Christ's word (ver. 31), but the word itself made no way in their minds; it was barred out by prejudices, and thus choked at its very first working. Christ thus represents his word first as the very atmosphere and home in which his true disciples abide, and then as a powerful influence which grows evermore in power and command as it is pondered. It means more and more to those who abide in it; it implicitly contains a whole universe of truth and reality, of impulse and motive, for those who allow to it "free course" - who are of the truth, and hear his voice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:37-40 Our Lord opposed the proud and vain confidence of these Jews, showing that their descent from Abraham could not profit those of a contrary spirit to him. Where the word of God has no place, no good is to be expected; room is left there for all wickedness. A sick person who turns from his physician, and will take neither remedies nor food, is past hope of recovery. The truth both heals and nourishes the hearts of those who receive it. The truth taught by philosophers has not this power and effect, but only the truth of God. Those who claim the privileges of Abraham, must do Abraham's works; must be strangers and sojourners in this world; keep up the worship of God in their families, and always walk before God.</body></html>
