The pronoun is emphatic. "Even if <span class= "ital">I</span> do bear witness of Myself, yet My witness is true." He had before quoted their law of evidence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-31.htm" title="If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.">John 5:31</a>), and showed that He fulfilled its canons. He is about to show this again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-17.htm" title="It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.">John 8:17-18</a>), but He claims first that in reality the law cannot apply to Him. They claim a human proof of that which transcends human knowledge. They claim the evidence of a witness, to a truth for which there could not possibly be a human witness.<p><span class= "bld">For I know whence I came, and whither I go.</span>--The requirement of two witnesses was based on the imperfection of individual knowledge, and the untrustworthiness of individual veracity. His evidence, as that of One who knew every circumstance affecting that of which He testified, was valid, for the perfection of His knowledge implied that He was divine. He and He only of all who have appeared in human form, knew the origin and issue of His life; He and He only knew the Father's home from which He came, and to which He was about to return. For the same words, "I go," or, <span class= "ital">I go away,</span> as applied to His voluntary death, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-33.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.">John 7:33</a>.<p><span class= "bld">But ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span>--The Greek word for "cannot tell" is the same as that for "know" in the previous clause. For "and" most of the better MSS. read <span class= "ital">or.</span> Making these corrections we have, <span class= "ital">But ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.</span> The change of tense is to be noted. Speaking of His own knowledge, He refers to the Incarnation in the historic past, "I came." Speaking of their continued ignorance, He refers to the coming as continuing in the present. Every renewed act and word was a coming to them from God. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>.) He knew, in the fulness of knowledge, the whence of past coming and the whither of future going. They knew neither the one nor the other. They do not even know His present mission. Once again His present teaching takes up words uttered before. They had said, "When the Christ cometh no man knoweth whence He is" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-27.htm" title="However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.">John 7:27</a>). He has, then, fulfilled their test. He had said, "Ye both know Me, and do know whence I am" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>); but that knowledge was of the earthly life only, and He now speaks to them of heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself</span> - in case I bear testimony, <span class="accented">I</span>, being who and what I am, and surrounded by Divine attestations, charged with a consciousness of a whole army and legion of approving witnesses, and, above all, with the Father's own testimony to me - <span class="cmt_word">my witness is true</span> - I satisfy in superlative fashion your own demand and also my own conceded test - <span class="cmt_word">because I know</span> - <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, with clear undisturbed self-consciousness I know, absolutely, invincibly, with perfect possession of the past and future - <span class="cmt_word">whence I came, and whither I am going.</span> The whole of our Christian verities turn upon the consciousness by Jesus of that which lay before and after that human life of his. He embraced the two eternities in his inward self-consciousness. That "<span class="accented">whence"</span> and that "whither," with all their infinite sublimity and solemnity, give adequate evidence and sufficient weight to his personal claim to be the Light of the world, because he is the temporary Embodiment of the eternal life which was with the Father, but is manifest to men (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But ye know not whence I come</span> - am ever coming forth to you with Divine judgment and calls of mercy - <span class="cmt_word">nor</span> <span class="cmt_word">whither</span> <span class="cmt_word">I am going.</span> "Neither the one nor the other;" not that Christ had not repeatedly told them in various and most expressive form. They could neither grasp the origin of his Personality, nor the method in which, as Messiah, through suffering, through an equation of his lot with man's (through the form of a slave and the death of a cross), he was doing the Father's will (cf. notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-29.htm">John 9:29</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:12-16 Christ is the Light of the world. God is light, and Christ is the image of the invisible God. One sun enlightens the whole world; so does one Christ, and there needs no more. What a dark dungeon would the world be without the sun! So would it be without Jesus, by whom light came into the world. Those who follow Christ shall not walk in darkness. They shall not be left without the truths which are necessary to keep them from destroying error, and the directions in the way of duty, necessary to keep them from condemning sin.</body></html>
