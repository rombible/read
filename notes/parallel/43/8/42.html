God's children would bear the spiritual image of their Father, and would love Him who came from God, but they were seeking to kill Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I proceeded forth and came from God.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">am come, am here.</span> His presence with them was the result of His proceeding from God. As the Son of God He had eternal fellowship with the Father. The Incarnation was not the mission of one whose existence was separate from that of God, but it was the mission of the Son who proceeded from the Father. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-27.htm" title="For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.">John 16:27</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">for not even of Myself am I come, but He sent Me;</span> as opposed to the thought that His origin was distinct from the Father. His coming was not His own act, but was a mission from God to the world.<p>But if He is sent from God, if He is present with them from God, if He proceeded from the Father, it must be that all who are true children of God would recognise and love Him.<p>It is important to note here that in our Lord's own words there is an assertion of the oneness of nature and of will with that of the Father, and yet the distinction of person is maintained. He is come from God, but He proceeded from the divine essence. He proceeded forth, and yet He was sent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - But Jesus will not allow them to claim the full privilege of sons of God. Said unto them, <span class="cmt_word">If God were your Father, ye would be loving me,</span> not seeking to slay me. Seeing that you do not love me, God is not your Father in the sense in which you are boasting such relation to him. The reason is: <span class="cmt_word">For I came forth out</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of God.</span> This expression only occurs in one other passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>), and there the texts vary between <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>. It points to the momentous and unique fact of his incarnation, as the projection from the very essence of God involved in the essence of his being. The Father is the eternal Source of Christ's Divine nature. There are two ether forms of expression used by our Lord. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a> and John 16:30 <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> is adopted, which describes rather the act of the incarnated One; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a> and John 17:8 <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, whereby is suggested the procession of Christ into the condition of fellowship with the eternal Father or that of being <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. By <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> he implies an even sublimer conception of the prenatal glory, and that, as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews puts it, "he was the Effulgence of his glory, and the express Image of his substance." <span class="cmt_word">And I am come.</span> I am here face to face with you. Meyer and others would make both verbs depend on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: but if we are right in the special meaning of the preposition, the force of it would be lost in the second clause. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> refers to his eternal procession from the very nature of God, and special indication of it when he took our human nature up into his own; and the <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> refers to his presence and appearance in their midst as a "Man who told them the truth." <span class="cmt_word">For neither have I come.</span> The perfect tense here is used in contrast to the present <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, to show that he has the whole past of his career as a divinely sent Messenger present in his consciousness. And he establishes the fact that he has proceeded from God by the dismission of every other alternative. <span class="accented">I have not come <span class="cmt_word"></span>from myself</span>, as an act of self-determination; I have not come to do my own will, but the Father's. I have not come on any self-chosen, self-honouring path, with motives of self-interest; <span class="cmt_word">but</span> in strict obedience to the Father's injunction - <span class="cmt_word">he sent me.</span> You would have loved me, not hated me, you would have trusted me and rejoiced in me, and not sought to kill me, if God were your Father; for you would then have felt all through my career that <span class="accented">that</span> One Father, of whom you boast an intimate knowledge, was revealing himself as One near to you, close to you, in the bare fact of my presence among you. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:41-47 Satan prompts men to excesses by which they murder themselves and others, while what he puts into the mind tends to ruin men's souls. He is the great promoter of falsehood of every kind. He is a liar, all his temptations are carried on by his calling evil good, and good evil, and promising freedom in sin. He is the author of all lies; whom liars resemble and obey, with whom all liars shall have their portion for ever. The special lusts of the devil are spiritual wickedness, the lusts of the mind, and corrupt reasonings, pride and envy, wrath and malice, enmity to good, and enticing others to evil. By the truth, here understand the revealed will of God as to the salvation of men by Jesus Christ, the truth Christ was now preaching, and which the Jews opposed.</body></html>
