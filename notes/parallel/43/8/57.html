Others, and among them were the "Elders who in Asia conferred with John, the Lord's disciple," have held that our Lord was between forty and fifty years of age at the time of his public ministry. We know this from the testimony of Irenaeus, who appears to have this very passage in his mind, for he says, <span class= "ital">"</span>As the gospel and all the Elders witness" (Lib. 2 chap. 22 ? 5; Oxford Translation, p. 160). But "fifty years" was the period of full manhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-39.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that enters into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm" title="This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 8:24</a>). This is expressed in round numbers, and there is no care to be more exact in comparison with the two thousand years which had passed since the close of Abraham's earthly life. The thought is, "Thou art still a young man, and hast thou seen Abraham who died twenty centuries ago?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews, therefore, said unto him</span> - once more misinterpreting his words, and giving a materialistic tone to his Divine hint - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast not yet fifty years</span> - "Thou art not fifty years old" - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and hast thou seen Abraham?</span> Christ did not <span class="accented">say</span> that be had seen Abraham, but that Abraham had seen and rejoiced in his day. The Jews chose to regard the language of Jesus as adding another immense improbability, if not falsehood, to his previous claims, viz. that he had actually lived to twice the age of Methuselah already. The "fifty years old" may have been simply used in round numbers for the age of man's prime and completed life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>). There may have been, even if our Lord was only thirty-three years of age at the time of his Passion, that which <span class="accented">apparently</span> added to his years. A tradition is mentioned (Irenaeus, 100, 2, 22. 5) of the more advanced age of Jesus which the Ephesian presbyters preserved, and which Irenaeus regards as between the forty-fifth and fiftieth years. Ernest de Bunsen vainly finds a reference to Christ's age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20</a>) in the forty-six years of the temple; but it is strange that, with the exception of the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>, there is nothing in the extraneous chronological data, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the death of Herod and recall of Pontius Pilate, which need positively compress our Lord's life within fifty years (Westcott). And Keim has made the suggestion that our Lord did carry on his ministry for a much longer period than is commonly supposed. It is far more probable, however, that the Jews were using an expression for the term of a completed life, and were supplying no chronological data whatever. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:54-59 Christ and all that are his, depend upon God for honour. Men may be able to dispute about God, yet may not know him. Such as know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ, are put together, 2Th 1:8. All who rightly know anything of Christ, earnestly desire to know more of him. Those who discern the dawn of the light of the Sun of Righteousness, wish to see his rising. Before Abraham was, I AM. This speaks Abraham a creature, and our Lord the Creator; well, therefore, might he make himself greater than Abraham. I AM, is the name of God, Ex 3:14; it speaks his self-existence; he is the First and the Last, ever the same, Re 1:8. Thus he was not only before Abraham, but before all worlds, Pr 8:23; Joh 1:1. As Mediator, he was the appointed Messiah, long before Abraham; the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, Re 13:8. The Lord Jesus was made of God Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, to Adam, and Abel, and all that lived and died by faith in him, before Abraham. The Jews were about to stone Jesus for blasphemy, but he withdrew; by his miraculous power he passed through them unhurt. Let us stedfastly profess what we know and believe concerning God; and if heirs of Abraham's faith, we shall rejoice in looking forward to that day when the Saviour shall appear in glory, to the confusion of his enemies, and to complete the salvation of all who believe in him.</body></html>
