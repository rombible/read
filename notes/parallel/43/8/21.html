He is still free to address the multitude, and after an interval does so. This interval is marked by the word "again," but is not necessarily more than a short break in the discourse. We shall find reason for believing (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>) that the whole of the teaching and work which is included between <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-21.htm" title="Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?">John 10:21</a>, is probably to be placed on the last and great day of the feast. The persons addressed are the people assembled round Him in the Temple. Some of the officials take part in the discussion, for it is "the Jews" who reply in the next verse. We have to think, it may be, of men gathered together in small groups discussing what He had before said. Some are really inquiring with earnest hearts about Him. The rulers are trying to suppress the growing conviction of the multitude. There are thus two currents of thought and feeling. One is found in the honest hearts of the untutored multitude; they know little of argument, and dare not interpret the Scriptures for themselves, but in their rough-and-ready way they are grasping the truth; the heart of man is bowing before the presence of its God. The other is found in the priests and rulers to whom, as a holy and learned caste, the representatives of God to man and the interpreters of their Sacred Books, the people are in intellectual and moral bondage. They seek to bind with their fetters hearts that are finding their way to the truth. Some of these groups have moved on, it may be, and others have taken their place. Seeing a new audience near Him, Jesus speaks to them again; for it is not probable that the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-27.htm" title="They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.">John 8:27</a> apply wholly to the same persons as those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-19.htm" title="Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">I go my way.</span>--The rendering is a little tinged by the following thought. The Greek word is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-14.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know from where I came, and where I go; but you cannot tell from where I come, and where I go.">John 8:14</a>, where it is rendered "I go." There, as here, <span class= "ital">I go away</span> is better. It was, let us again remind ourselves, the last day of the feast, and now its closing hours have come. That thronging multitude would be before the close of another day, leaving Jerusalem to spread itself through all the extent of Palestine and the Dispersion. He also is going away. Many of them will never see Him again. Before another Feast of Tabernacles He will, in a deeper sense, be going away. They will seek Him, but it will be too late. There is in all the discourse the solemn feeling that these are the last words for many who hear Him.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins.</span>--Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-34.htm" title="You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.">John 7:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-36.htm" title="What manner of saying is this that he said, You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come?">John 7:36</a>. But here the result of the seeking and not finding is declared in the sadness of its fatal issue. "In your sins" is not quite exact, and is, perhaps, somewhat misleading. The Greek has the singular not the plural, and should be rendered "in your sin." It points out the state of sin, rather than actual transgressions. This latter thought is expressed where the words are repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm" title="I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.">John 8:24</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - This verse introduces a new scene and place, and perhaps a new day. The audience may have greatly changed, even if it had within it some of the same bewildered and exasperated enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Again</span> <span class="cmt_word">he said, therefore.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the fact that his liberty had not been infringed. The providence of God, the fear of the people, the inadequacy or confusing nature of the reports of his speech which had been taken to the authorities, had for a while arrested the tragedy. "No one laid hands on him." In consequence of this circumstance he said <span class="cmt_word">unto them again</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> on a subsequent occasion), <span class="cmt_word">I go away, and ye shall seek me.</span> So much he had said before to "the Jews," adding, "Ye shall not find me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-34.htm">John 7:34</a>). Thus also he spake, later on, to the disciples, adding, "Thither ye cannot come" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>). On all three occasions he was misunderstood. His departure was a mystery to the Jews, who thought, or at least said, that he, a pseudo-Messiah, might be contemplating a mission to the Greeks and to the Dispersion. His departure to the Father by a bloodstained pathway, by violent death, was unspeakably perplexing to his most intimate friends. The bare idea utterly conflicted with the current notion of the Christ; but it was in the last case (ch. 14.) modified by the promise that, though he was about to leave them and to return to his Father, yet he would come again - they should once more beheld him, and he would provide a place for them. Still, they would not be able for a while to follow him, even though willing to lay down their life for his sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>, etc.). But in the face of a more bitter misunderstanding and an utter inability to perceive and know either him or the Father, Christ said not only, "Ye shall seek me," <span class="cmt_word">but ye shall die in your sin</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> here indicates rather the condition in which they should die than the cause of their death. "In," not "of" (so Hengstenberg, Meyer, and Luthardt). He did not say, "perish by reason <span class="accented">of</span> this sin," but "die <span class="accented">in</span> this sin." They will die looking vaguely, hopelessly, for the Saviour whom they have, in such an hyperbole of spiritual dulness and of bitter malice alike, misunderstood and rejected. They will pass through the gate of death with no deliverance from sin secured. Knowing neither the Father nor the eternal life and light manifested in himself, they will seek and not find, they will die unsanctified, unatoned, unreconciled No gleam of light will play over the dark ness of the grave. <span class="cmt_word">Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span> The eternal home of the Father's love will not open to such angry search. Such utter misunderstanding as they had evinced, such point blank refusal to walk in his light, will impede and block the way to the heart of the Father, whose perfect revelation and sufficient pleading they steadily resist. The language of this verse is probably the condensation and conclusion of s much longer debate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:21-29 Those that live in unbelief, are for ever undone, if they die in unbelief. The Jews belonged to this present evil world, but Jesus was of a heavenly and Divine nature, so that his doctrine, kingdom, and blessings, would not suit their taste. But the curse of the law is done away to all that submit to the grace of the gospel. Nothing but the doctrine of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, and none but the Spirit of Christ's grace will be an agent powerful enough, to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, and that doctrine is given, to work upon those only who believe in Christ. Some say, Who is this Jesus? They allow him to have been a Prophet, an excellent Teacher, and even more than a creature; but cannot acknowledge him as over all, God blessed for evermore. Will not this suffice? Jesus here answers the question. Is this to honour him as the Father? Does this admit his being the Light of the world, and the Life of men, one with the Father? All shall know by their conversion, or in their condemnation, that he always spake and did what pleased the Father, even when he claimed the highest honours to himself.</body></html>
