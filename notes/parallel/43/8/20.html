Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-41.htm" title="And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.">Mark 12:41</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-1.htm" title="And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.">Luke 21:1</a>. From the passage it is clear that the word "treasury" was applied to the brazen trumpet-shaped chests placed in the court of the women for the reception of alms. There were thirteen of them, and each bore an inscription showing to what purpose the alms placed in it would be devoted. Here the word is apparently used of the place itself in which the chests were deposited, or the preposition must be taken as including the immediate neighbourhood. This notice of place is interesting in many ways. The court of the women was one of the most public places in the Temple area. He taught, then, openly and fearlessly. The chamber in which the Sanhedrin held their session was between the court of the women and that of the men. They had on that very day been assembled to take counsel against Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-45.htm" title="Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?">John 7:45-52</a>). This gives point to the words which follow, "and no man laid hands on Him, for His hour was not yet come." The court of the women, moreover, was the spot where the great candelabra stood. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-30.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Further controversy with different groups, ending in partial admission of his claims by some.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These words</span> - an expression which emphasized the foregoing interview, and shut it off from the following context - <span class="cmt_word">spake he</span> (<span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in the treasury, as he taught in the temple courts</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-1.htm">Luke 20:1</a>) may be the chamber in which the thirteen chests, with trumpet like orifices for the reception of alms, were erected. If so, it was in the "court of the women," or the place of public assembly most abundantly frequented by the multitude, and beyond which the women could not penetrate into the "court of the priests." Edersheim disputes Westcott's suggestion, that the <span class="accented">gazith</span>, or session house of the Sanhedrin, was close by, and that the language of Jesus was within earshot of <span class="accented">them.</span> This chamber, <span class="accented">gazith</span>, was in the southeast corner of the "court of the priests," and therefore far away from the treasure chamber. Supposing that the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was the treasury itself. the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> may point to the neighbourhood of the sacred enclosure. The reference shows that the locality even of the discourse had made profound impression on one of the disciples, and implies great publicity and imminent peril from these bold avowals. The clause added by the evangelist, <span class="cmt_word">And no man seized him; because his hour was not yet come,</span> is a phrase repeated frequently, and one which delays, by a strange refrain, the tragic consummation (see Introduction, &sect; VII. 5 (4)). Here it shows that some further attempt was made to lay violent hands on him, which for the moment failed. Seeing that avowals of his Divine nature wrought to a frenzy the passions of soma of his hearers, and finally led to his condemnation for a capital offence, the evangelist again and again shows that the Lord - who made these claims on his trial, as given in the synoptists - had frequently reiterated them at peril of his life. The language of the high priest shows how bitterly the ecclesiastical authorities resented this assumption. The Fourth Gospel makes the synoptic account of this matter more intelligible by showing us that it was not an isolated occurrence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:17-20 If we knew Christ better, we should know the Father better. Those become vain in their imaginations concerning God, who will not learn of Christ. Those who know not his glory and grace, know not the Father that sent him. The time of our departure out of the world, depends upon God. Our enemies cannot hasten it any sooner, nor can our friends delay it any longer, than the time appointed of the Father. Every true believer can look up and say with pleasure, My times are in thy hand, and better there than in my own. To all God's purposes there is a time.</body></html>
