These words seem to arise from their judgment of Him as expressed in their scornful question, "Who art thou?" He has, indeed, immediately before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.">John 8:23</a>), spoken of them. He is about in this discourse to do so again. There are present to His mind now many things to say of them, and these, if said, would be in words of condemnation; but He refrains. There is present to His mind also the great work He had to do--to speak to the world the eternal truth of God.<p><span class= "bld">But he that sent me is true.</span>--The words express a marked contrast to the words and thoughts with which He would come in contact, if He said and judged concerning them. They refer to the calm repose of the divine life in heaven, as contrasted with the misunderstandings and objections with which the manifestation of that life on earth had been encompassed. He turns from them to the thought of Him who sent Him, and who is true.<p><span class= "bld">And I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I speak unto the world the things which I heard from Him.</span> It is the truth brought into and announced in the world, and which was heard during the pre-incarnate life with the Father. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-38.htm" title="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.">John 8:38</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you.</span> Hitherto, when the Lord uttered his great words of self-revelation, which always had an ethical end and were meant for the advantage of his hearers, they interrupted his speech and disputed his claims. They refused these testimonies to himself which, if true, would necessitate their instantaneous submission. He seems to have gathered all his self-witness together in the word, "I am," verify altogether, absolutely, from the beginning onwards, just what my words convey; but I have much more to say <span class="accented">concerning you</span>, even if I should have nothing more to say concerning myself. The testimonies and the judgments may be profoundly distasteful to you, <span class="accented">but</span> I dare not therefore withhold them. I am come to deliver them at any cost to myself or you. <span class="cmt_word">But he that sent me is true,</span> whether you hear or forbear; and I am his Mouthpiece, so the truth has to be told. The thought of God, if we can only approach it, is the absolute truth about every thing and about every man.

"Speak <span class="accented">into</span>, so that the words may reach as far as and spread through the world" (Westcott). The expression seems to have left him <span class="accented">above</span> or outside the world, so that he appears as "the Mediator between two worlds." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:21-29 Those that live in unbelief, are for ever undone, if they die in unbelief. The Jews belonged to this present evil world, but Jesus was of a heavenly and Divine nature, so that his doctrine, kingdom, and blessings, would not suit their taste. But the curse of the law is done away to all that submit to the grace of the gospel. Nothing but the doctrine of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, and none but the Spirit of Christ's grace will be an agent powerful enough, to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, and that doctrine is given, to work upon those only who believe in Christ. Some say, Who is this Jesus? They allow him to have been a Prophet, an excellent Teacher, and even more than a creature; but cannot acknowledge him as over all, God blessed for evermore. Will not this suffice? Jesus here answers the question. Is this to honour him as the Father? Does this admit his being the Light of the world, and the Life of men, one with the Father? All shall know by their conversion, or in their condemnation, that he always spake and did what pleased the Father, even when he claimed the highest honours to himself.</body></html>
