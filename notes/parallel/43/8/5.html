It would be a case of rare occurrence, and perhaps for this very reason, one on which the opinions of later Rabbis were divided. Strangulation was regarded as the punishment intended when no other was specified; and in the Talmudic distinction in cases of this kind, stoning and strangulation are named as the respective punishments:--"Filia Israelitae, si adultera cum nupta, strangulanda; cum desponsata tantum, lapidanda. Filia Sacerdotis. si adultera cum nupta, lapidanda; cum desponsata tantum, comburenda (<span class= "ital">Sanhedrin,</span> fol. 51, 2).<p><span class= "bld">But what sayest thou?</span>--The question is, like that about the tribute money (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-17.htm" title="Tell us therefore, What think you? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?">Matthew 22:17</a>), a snare in which they hope to take Him whatever answer He gives. If He answers that she should be stoned, this would excite the opposition of the multitude, for a lax state of morality had practically made the laws against unchastity a dead letter. The immorality of Rome had spread through the provinces of the empire, and although the Jews were less infected by it than others, the court of the Herods had introduced its worst forms, and Christ Himself speaks of them as "an evil and adulterous generation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">James 4:4</a>). To have pronounced for a severe law against common forms of sin would have been to undermine popular support, and it is this only that the rulers had to fear. To have pronounced for capital punishment would moreover have brought Him into collision with the Roman government, which reserved to itself the power of life and death. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-31.htm" title="Then said Pilate to them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:">John 18:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-7.htm" title="The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.">John 19:7</a>.) Had He uttered a word in derogation of the majesty of the Roman empire, the charge of treason--in which case to be accused was practically to be condemned--would at once have been brought against Him. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-12.htm" title="And from thereafter Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.">John 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-15.htm" title="But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.">John 19:15</a>.) It is clearly the more severe view that the form of the question is intended to draw forth. "Moses said, in express words, . . .; what dost Thou say? You surely will not differ from Moses?" But if He had taken the laxer view, then this, like the Sabbath question, would have been a charge of breaking the Law. He would have been brought before the Sanhedrin as a false Messiah, for the true Messiah was to establish the Law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Moses in the Law commanded us, that such should be stoned</span> (or, <span class="accented">to stone such</span>); <span class="cmt_word">but what sayest thou?</span> The Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a>, etc.) prescribed stoning for both parties when the woman is the <span class="accented">betrothed</span> bride of another man, and if she make no sufficient attempt to foil the purpose of her seducer. For ordinary adultery the death penalty is left indefinite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). It is no proof that strangulation was the method of punishment in the days of our Lord because the Talmud and Maimonides thus express it. Meyer concludes that the woman was a <span class="accented">betrothed</span> bride. This offence is, broadly speaking. "adultery" of an aggravated kind. The reference to the method of the punishment is not demonstrable proof of this, because it would be easily feasible to transfer the method of the death from the extreme case to the ordinary ease of nuptial infidelity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a> for the punishment of unspecified death for sabbath violation (repeated <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm">Exodus 35:2</a>), interpreted of "stoning" in the special illustrative case, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-36</a>). This is Moses' Law - "<span class="accented">what sayest thou?"</span> This query involves an ascription to Jesus of the right of authoritatively interpreting the Law. thus attributing to him the functions of a new legislator. Some have objected to the bare possibility of such an appeal being made to Jesus by any species of Jewish authority. The whole context shows that the process was malicious, ironical, crafty. The entire audience knew that this law had never been accepted or applied literally; that the Sanhedrin had not enforced it; and that, if they had endeavoured to do so, the Roman power had taken from the nation the <span class="accented">jus gladii.</span> The question, therefore, became one of casuistry inflamed by a concrete case, and having as its ally a secret sympathy with the offenders. It was not uncommon for the rabbis to discuss the incidence of <span class="accented">obsolete</span> laws. Many of the glosses upon the ancient law, and laborious trifling with specific regulations of the so called oral law, turn upon customs that were absolutely impracticable under the new conditions of the Jewish life. This, however, was no mere quibble of words about possible duties. The query was put with dramatic force and in concrete form. The shame and life of a fellow creature were the materials which this eager and bloodthirsty group were utilizing for their vile purpose. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-11 Christ neither found fault with the law, nor excused the prisoner's guilt; nor did he countenance the pretended zeal of the Pharisees. Those are self-condemned who judge others, and yet do the same thing. All who are any way called to blame the faults of others, are especially concerned to look to themselves, and keep themselves pure. In this matter Christ attended to the great work about which he came into the world, that was, to bring sinners to repentance; not to destroy, but to save. He aimed to bring, not only the accused to repentance, by showing her his mercy, but the prosecutors also, by showing them their sins; they thought to insnare him, he sought to convince and convert them. He declined to meddle with the magistrate's office. Many crimes merit far more severe punishment than they meet with; but we should not leave our own work, to take that upon ourselves to which we are not called. When Christ sent her away, it was with this caution, Go, and sin no more. Those who help to save the life of a criminal, should help to save the soul with the same caution. Those are truly happy, whom Christ does not condemn. Christ's favour to us in the forgiveness of past sins should prevail with us, Go then, and sin no more.</body></html>
