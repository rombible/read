"Ye who have claimed Abraham and God as your father. <span class= "ital">Ye</span> are of the father, but that father is the devil." The possessive pronoun (your) is not expressed in the Greek, and the form of the sentence is one which would have required it if it were included in the sense. The father who has been referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-38.htm" title="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.">John 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-41.htm" title="You do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.">John 8:41</a> is now definitely named. The relation between father and son is maintained, but the father of the thoughts and acts of those to whom He speaks was not God, not Abraham, but the devil.<p><span class= "bld">And the lusts of your father ye will do.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">ye desire to do, ye will to do.</span> The verb is not an auxiliary, as it appears to be in our version, but expresses the determination of the will. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-40.htm" title="And you will not come to me, that you might have life.">John 5:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He was a murderer from the beginning.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-23.htm" title="For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.">Wisdom Of Solomon 2:23-24</a>, "For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of His own eternity. Nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death into the world, and they that do hold of his side do find it." So St. Paul, "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>). The Fall was the murder of the human race; and it is in reference to this, of which the fratricide in the first family was a signal result, that the Tempter is called a murderer from the beginning (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>). "Cain was of that wicked one, and slew his brother." (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-8.htm" title="He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.">1John 3:8-12</a>, where the thought is expanded.) The reference to the murderer is suggested here by the fact that the Jews had been seeking to kill our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>). They are true to the nature which their father had from the beginning.<p><span class= "bld">And abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.</span> The word is not that which we have before had in the sense of "abide" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>), and the tense of the verb is present in meaning. The words do not refer to the fall of the devil, which is here implied but not stated, but to his constant character. He has no place in the sphere of the truth; it is not the region of his action and outer life; and the result of this is that there is no truth in the sphere of his thought and inner life. Had he been true, he would have come to stand in the light and life of truth.<p><span class= "bld">When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own.</span>--This is in contrast to the work of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>) and to the work of the Holy Spirit (Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>.) The Holy Spirit will not speak of Himself; He came to speak the truth which He heard from God. The devil speaketh a lie (comp. Genesis 3), and this is of his own (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-35.htm" title="A good man out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.">Matthew 12:35</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For he is a liar, and the father of it.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and the father of the liar.</span> This is probably the meaning of the Greek, and it can only be expressed in English by the repetition of the substantive. The verse ends as it begins, by a reference to the Jews whom He is addressing. They were of the nature of him whose spiritual children they were. The murderous thoughts in their hearts, and their non-receptivity of truth, plainly indicated who their father was.<p>The reader will hardly, perhaps, need to be cautioned against the old heretical rendering of the first and last clauses of this verse, by "Ye are of the father of the devil . . . for he is a liar, and also his father." Still, as this view has been revived in some quarters in our own day, one word of reminder that it is no less opposed to the context and the teaching of this Gospel than it is to the whole tenor of Biblical truth and of rational theology, may not be misplaced. On the personality of the devil, which, if plain words have any meaning, is here implied in the words of Christ, see Notes on Matthew 4.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are of the father who is the devil.</span> In this way the great bulk of the best commentators translate this difficult clause, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar, and Davidson translate, "You are of the father of the devil;" and suggest that here the evangelist betrays his fierce Gnostic (Ophite) antagonism to the Jews, and adopts the view that the God of the Old Testament, the "Creator," was the Father of the serpent. This is surely untenable. The Creator of all things, in the prologue, is none other than the Father acting through the Logos. In the third, fourth, and fifth chapters, the greatest honours are ascribed to the God of the Jewish people, and not the faintest hint given of such radical divergence from the standpoint of Judaism. In this very passage the father of the faithful Jews is spoken of with profound reverence. "The second-century Gnostic" must have so cleverly concealed his sentiments, and have refuted his position so frequently, that it is inexcusably inept for him to have shown his cloven foot on this occasion. Thoma ignores the wild conjecture of Hilgenfeld. Our Lord was not dealing with the parentage of the devil, but with the moral and religious parentage of those Jews who were manifesting the most bitter antagonism to himself and plotting his destruction. For them to claim spiritual kinship and childlike feeling to the Father whose holy nature and whose love to them he was revealing, was a strange contradiction in terms. Our Lord repudiated it in this terrible language. He had worsted the seductive suggestions of the devil, and when he saw and heard them repeated and set forth as Divine proposals, he gave them their true name. "You disclaim the faintest sympathy with other gods; you resent the bar sinister on your escutcheon; you say that religiously as well as historically you are not born of any fornication - there is no taint in your theological position; but I tell you plainly that <span class="accented">you are from</span>, you are manifesting the very essence and substance of, the father who is the prime enemy of God and man. The phrase is in perfect keeping with many synoptic phrases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>; cf. John the Baptist's language, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the lusts of your father</span> - those of falsehood and murder, lying and slaughter, being the top and chief of all his evil passions - <span class="cmt_word">ye are</span> willing, <span class="cmt_word">desirous to do</span>. He has engendered these very lusts within you. The paternity of your angry passions, your incapacity to see and accept my word, are both alike explained. There is no more terrible rebuke in the whole compass of revelation. The disciple whom Jesus loved, in preserving these words, shows very decidedly that he was a "Son of Thunder," and calls down fire from heaven (a very storm) which has been ever since descending upon the heads of these and all other bitter antagonists of the Son of man. <span class="cmt_word">He was a murderer</span> (literally, <span class="accented">a manslayer</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>from the beginning.</span> This has often been referred to the spirit which animated Cain in the slaughter of his brother Abel. There is some corroboration of such a reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>, "Cain was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of that wicked one, and slew his brother;" and in the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>, "Whoso hateth his brother is a murderer." (So Lucke, Reuss, De Wette, and others.) But the narrative of the death of Abel makes no reference to the agency of the devil, but rather indicates that the sin of Cain was originated by his having been begotten in the image of the fallen Adam. The better interpretation and reference of the words may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>, "He that doeth sin is from the devil (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), for the devil sinneth from the beginning (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>)." And sin entered into the world through the seduction and false statements of the devil, by which the first man was veritably slain, his moral nature killed outright. Grace was not shut out, but Adam died. In the day that he ate of the forbidden tree, man most surely and in the deepest sense <span class="accented">died.</span> "God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity. Nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of its side do find it" (Wisd. 2:23, 24; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>); "Sin entered into the world, and death by sin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The work of destruction at the beginning of humanity upon earth has never been exhausted. In murderous propensity, in lying and seductive words and ways, the children of wrath are ever showing their parentage. To this statement our Lord added what has by many been regarded as a distinct revelation of the fall of Satan himself from the condition of rectitude (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He stands not;</span> continues not - in the truth (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the perfect is the better reading, and demands this translation; the rendering of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">stetit</span>, favoured by Augustine, and involving a reference to the <span class="accented">fall of the devil</span>, would have required <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, pluperfect). Jesus (lid not, therefore, explicitly assert anything with reference to the act of original revolt of the devil, but declared that the devil has no place in truth; he restlessly resists, throwing a hopeless, perilous glamour of falsehood round all he touches. Schaff suggests, rightly, that the combination of this statement with that of the prologue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>) <span class="accented">presupposes</span> the fall of this mighty and murderous spirit from a previous condition of rectitude, and the dictum of our Lord ought never to have been charged with the admission of an eternal principle of evil. The fall of the lost angels is not explicitly stated. <span class="cmt_word">Because there is no truth in him.</span> The absence of the article before "truth" shows that in the previous clause the objective truth is meant, that the reality of things as known by him is referred to. The truth was that region or sphere of action in which he elected not to stand, and, as a matter of fact, does not stand nor find place. By "truth" is meant subjective truth or "truthfulness," the spirit which repudiates falsehood in all its forms and manifestations. There is no consistency with himself, no inward harmony with reality. This is given as reason why the devil stands not in <span class="accented">the</span> truth. <span class="cmt_word">Whensoever</span> <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">speaketh a lie, he speaketh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, out of) <span class="cmt_word">his own</span> resources - from what is most entirely his own, revealing the depth of his truthless, loveless, fatal, godless nature. Schaff quotes from Gothe's 'Faust' the account which Mephistopheles gives of his own being. Here it is in Kegan Paul's translation - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I am the spirit, who aye deny!<br />And rightly so; for everything<br />Is only good for perishing;<br />So better 'twere that nought had been,<br />And, therefore, all that you call sin<br />Ruin, whate'er with evil's rife<br />Is my true element of life."</span> Gothe exactly expressed the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> by "mein eigentliches element." <span class="cmt_word">Because he is a liar, and the father of the liar.</span> This translation makes the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, which is the most natural antecedent (so Bengel, Meyer, Lange, Godet, etc.), notwithstanding the difficulty of the construction. This language asserts not only the agelong proof which history gives of the falsehood of this terrible personality, but declares that he exerts an evil paternity in the life of every liar. "Brood of vipers" is a phrase used by John Baptist and Christ himself when addressing Pharisees. The well known imagery of the first promise, "I will put enmity between her seed and thy seed," etc., suggests the same thought. There is an awful significance in this power of the devil to sow his deadly seed in human life, and to produce thus, on the soil of human nature, "children of the wicked one" (cf. Paul's language, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10</a>, addressed to Elymas, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "son of the devil"). Another translation makes <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">He is a liar, and the father of falsehood</span>, or <span class="accented">thereof</span> (Revised Version); thus drawing an abstract out of the concrete <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or possibly referring to the first he which slew the spiritual life of men - to the "Ye shall not surely die" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4</a>. It is against this view that our Lord is here dealing with persons rather than with abstractions. Westcott and Moulton and Revised Version in margin have given indefiniteness to the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>, and translate, "Whensoever one [or, 'a man'] speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for his father also is a liar;" the idea being that the evil inheritance from the father of lies has even made falsehood the essential element, the <span class="accented">proprium</span>, of the liar. This, however, appears to involve a very complicated thought. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, if strictly spoken, contradicts the idea of the liar's peculiarities being the result of inheritance. Still less satisfactory is the vain endeavour of the Gnostics, who found here a second reference to the father of the devil. They discovered in some Italic Versions, and in the usage of some of the Fathers, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, in place of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, and so took it to mean, "he is a liar, as also his father." Higenfeld and Volkmar have fastened upon this text also, and thus found further proof of Gnostic (Ophite) heresy in the Gospel. Riggenbach and Godet have remarked that, if the father of the devil was spoken of in the previous clause, "his father" would mean "the father of the father of the devil"! We have already seen how groundless such a charge against the Gospel is, and how such a rendering would throw the entire context into confusion. If we accept the first translation, we find that our Lord announces a doctrine concerning the devil, and conveys more information than can be obtained from any other source. This is not mere accommodation to the consciousness of a daemoniac or the prejudices of the Jews, as some have interpreted Christ's language in the synoptic Gospels, but it is distinct dogmatic teaching about the personality, character, and method of the devil. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:41-47 Satan prompts men to excesses by which they murder themselves and others, while what he puts into the mind tends to ruin men's souls. He is the great promoter of falsehood of every kind. He is a liar, all his temptations are carried on by his calling evil good, and good evil, and promising freedom in sin. He is the author of all lies; whom liars resemble and obey, with whom all liars shall have their portion for ever. The special lusts of the devil are spiritual wickedness, the lusts of the mind, and corrupt reasonings, pride and envy, wrath and malice, enmity to good, and enticing others to evil. By the truth, here understand the revealed will of God as to the salvation of men by Jesus Christ, the truth Christ was now preaching, and which the Jews opposed.</body></html>
