Both the Crucifixion and Ascension are implied here. Now. for the first time, they are marked out as the instruments of the Crucifixion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm" title="And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.">Acts 3:15</a>), and therefore the means by which He will return to His Father's throne.<p><span class= "bld">Then shall ye know . . .</span>--These words confirm the view that the teaching of these verses arises immediately out of their present ignorance. Then the veil will be removed. Then the death of Christ will be followed by His glory. As we read these words they impress us with that calm of assured certainty with which they are uttered (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>) before the events, and reminds us of the signal way in which they were fulfilled. (Comp., <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-39.htm" title="For I say to you, You shall not see me from now on, till you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.">Matthew 23:39</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-37.htm" title="Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do?">Acts 2:37</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That I am he.</span>--Comp.

They will then know that He is divine, and that the acts and words which they cannot now understand are part of the divine life in union with the Father. Now they marvel and ask, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm" title="And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?">John 7:15</a>): then they shall know that according as the Father taught Him, He spake these things. Now they cannot understand the witness of the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-19.htm" title="Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a>): then they shall know that He that sent Him was with Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - But when Jesus turns to them again he calls special attention to the main source of their continuous misconception and rejection. Not only is he "the Son," and "the Son of God," but indubitably he is also "the Son of man." He has come down from heaven and is before them as a Man among men - "one Jesus." He has taken upon himself the form of a slave, the fashion of man. That the manifestation of the Divine should be perfectly realized in the human, though a fundamental truth lying at the heart of all revelation, is nevertheless <span class="accented">not</span> the alphabet of Divine teaching; nay, it is the very highest and most recondite of all truths. This humbled humanity of the incarnate Logos led on to other issues of enormous significance. The eternal Son in the form of God would become, as "Son of man," obedient unto death. The highest revelation of the Son of God, and therefore of the Father, would be effected by the surrender of that mysterious life of his for the world's behoof. The previous announcements of this truth, which we now see to be the very crown and culmination of the gospel, had greatly offended his hearers of all kinds, and on distinct grounds. In the words that follow a touch of deeper meaning than any which had preceded is supplied when he proceeds to associate this death of the Son of man with the wilful act of the ecclesiastical authorities in Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said</span> (<span class="accented">unto them</span>), <span class="cmt_word">When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man</span> (compare here notes on John 3:14; 6:62; 12:32). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is used with the twofold sense of exaltation on the cross" signifying by what death he should glorify God" - and also of the issues of that lifting up by means of the tree of ignoble torment and mortal agony to the throne of glory. The twofold meaning of the word cannot be excluded here. <span class="cmt_word">Then ye shall come to</span> <span class="cmt_word">know</span> - then the process of proof will be completed - <span class="cmt_word">that I am</span> (<span class="cmt_word">he</span>) - that I am that which fundamentally I am declaring to you, that my testimonies have unique but trenchant confirmation - <span class="cmt_word">and that I am doing nothing from myself, but that even as the Father taught me,</span> (so) <span class="cmt_word">these things I speak.</span> The "he that sent me" (ver. 26), is here replaced by "the Father." "The things which I heard from (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) him" is replaced by "even as the Father taught me," and the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> are repeated. "The cross and the crown" will be the proof to the most obtuse and bigoted "<span class="accented">that I am</span> that which I say I am." The forecast is here given of the conversion of his murderers, the overwhelming effects produced by the resurrection and the ascension of Jesus, and the gift of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>). Bengel: "Cognoscetis ex re, quod nunc ex verbo non creditis." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:21-29 Those that live in unbelief, are for ever undone, if they die in unbelief. The Jews belonged to this present evil world, but Jesus was of a heavenly and Divine nature, so that his doctrine, kingdom, and blessings, would not suit their taste. But the curse of the law is done away to all that submit to the grace of the gospel. Nothing but the doctrine of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, and none but the Spirit of Christ's grace will be an agent powerful enough, to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, and that doctrine is given, to work upon those only who believe in Christ. Some say, Who is this Jesus? They allow him to have been a Prophet, an excellent Teacher, and even more than a creature; but cannot acknowledge him as over all, God blessed for evermore. Will not this suffice? Jesus here answers the question. Is this to honour him as the Father? Does this admit his being the Light of the world, and the Life of men, one with the Father? All shall know by their conversion, or in their condemnation, that he always spake and did what pleased the Father, even when he claimed the highest honours to himself.</body></html>
