They seek to destroy the human life which for the sake of humanity He has assumed.<p><span class= "bld">This did not Abraham.</span>--It is usual to explain these words by a reference to Abraham's receptivity of the divine truth and messengers (see Genesis 12; Genesis 14; Genesis 18; Genesis 22); but they probably point to the whole course of the patriarchal life as directly opposed to the spirit of those who claim to be his children.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now</span>, as things are, <span class="cmt_word">ye are seeking</span> - plotting, contriving, in subtle ways and by false charges - <span class="cmt_word">to kill me.</span> The entire discourse is made more obvious by our Lord's discovery of the plot of the last few days, and by his allowing his friends and opponents to know that he had penetrated the thin, subtle disguise under which this murderous plan was veiled. The excitement produced by this bold charge among his own true disciples, and those who now for the first time heard of it, by our Lord's then and there lifting the veil from many a specious question; the look of guilt on the countenances of some, of truculent admission of the charge in the gesture of others; the loud murmurs and confused cries of the crowd, - must all be realized to apprehend the tremendous crisis which had now arrived. He aggravated the charge by describing himself as <span class="cmt_word">a man who hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">declared to you the truth which I heard from God.</span> This is the only place where the Lord speaks of himself as "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">man"</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). He here describes himself as One who is subject and liable to their murderous passion - <span class="accented">a man</span>, seeing that his eternal Personality has been presented to his antagonists in the form of man. His manhood was the link of relation between the God who sent him, taught him, surrounded and enveloped him, and the consciousness of his hearers. This is the highest representation of the very conception of a Divine commission and a Divine message. They were seeking to stamp out a Divine fire, to drown a heavenly voice, to refuse and trample upon a sacred Messenger. <span class="cmt_word">This did not Abraham.</span> The father of the faithful was susceptible to the heavenly voice, he heard and obeyed the voice of Jehovah with childlike docility (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12, 14, 18, 22</a>.). The visions, the commands, the messengers, the manifestations, of God to Abraham were so readily accepted that his faith is a proverb, and his greatest name is "friend of God." The wilful, hurried, malicious treatment of both the Divine Messenger and the sacred message, both of which Jesus declared to have come directly from God, proves the lack of relation with the Life of Abraham. They might be Abraham's "seed" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) but not his (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) children, and he in this sense could not be their "father." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:37-40 Our Lord opposed the proud and vain confidence of these Jews, showing that their descent from Abraham could not profit those of a contrary spirit to him. Where the word of God has no place, no good is to be expected; room is left there for all wickedness. A sick person who turns from his physician, and will take neither remedies nor food, is past hope of recovery. The truth both heals and nourishes the hearts of those who receive it. The truth taught by philosophers has not this power and effect, but only the truth of God. Those who claim the privileges of Abraham, must do Abraham's works; must be strangers and sojourners in this world; keep up the worship of God in their families, and always walk before God.</body></html>
