His judgment is not individual judgment, because of the union with the Father. His witness is not only individual witness, but that of the Father also. The whole passage should be carefully compared with the close of John 5.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the</span> (<span class="cmt_word">one</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that bears witness concerning myself</span> - I have said it, and abide by it, and I know what I say and how fully I am fulfilling these words - <span class="cmt_word">and the Father that sent me heareth witness concerning me</span>. His <span class="accented">words</span> reflected his own Divine self-consciousness. They bore one witness to his unique position. They brought out the inner thoughts of Christ, and revealed the life that was light. The word, the speech, of Christ was a fire kindled which would never be extinguished - it was the formal utterance of the eternal reality but it did not stand alone. The Father that sent him, by a long chain of events and revelations, by miracles and mighty energies, by the conference of the spirit of conviction upon the minds that gave candid attention to his verbal testimony, by the providential concurrence of facts with prophetic anticipation, was bearing witness concerning him. The argument is sufficient, so soon as we admit the terms used by Jesus, so soon as we recognize the ideas of the Son of God and of the Father, both alike revealed in the Person of Christ. We can understand, and to some extent sympathize with, the perplexity of the Pharisees. Later experiences have made it easier for us to understand the testimony of the Father, the presence and witness of God over and above the testimony of men and coincident with it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-27.htm">John 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). All great spiritual revivals have given ample proof of the twofold testimony (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, where Paul, the writer of the Epistle, shows himself familiar with this "Johannine" thought; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:17-20 If we knew Christ better, we should know the Father better. Those become vain in their imaginations concerning God, who will not learn of Christ. Those who know not his glory and grace, know not the Father that sent him. The time of our departure out of the world, depends upon God. Our enemies cannot hasten it any sooner, nor can our friends delay it any longer, than the time appointed of the Father. Every true believer can look up and say with pleasure, My times are in thy hand, and better there than in my own. To all God's purposes there is a time.</body></html>
