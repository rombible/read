The charge of being a Samaritan He passes over. His words soon after taught that a Samaritan may be more truly the child of God than priest or Levite is. The statement that He is possessed by an evil power from the spirit world He denies.<p><span class= "bld">I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</span>--There is a connection between all His works and words and the unseen world. It is the union of Father and Son, and His life had been the constant honouring of the Father, whose will it was His meat to do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-31.htm" title="In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.">John 4:31</a>). Their works and words were as constantly--and this last calumny is an instance of it--dishonouring Him. The contrast suggests that this dishonour was not of Him only; but also of the Father whom He honoured, and whom they claimed as their God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - To this <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered,</span> in calm and patient remonstrance, <span class="cmt_word">I have not a daemon.</span> No strange or evil power haunts me; I am perfectly clear in my consciousness. Once before, when accused of complicity with Beelzebub, he had retorted with awful solemnity, and an appeal to the conscience of his enemies and to the patent facts of his own warfare with all the kingdom of Satan. It is interesting to observe that he takes no notice of the charge, "Thou art a Samaritan." If the above suggestion of Edersheim were accepted, the silence would be explained; but it was more probably occasioned by Christ's unwillingness to repudiate fellowship with this persecuted nationality. The parable of the good Samaritan was probably delivered about this time. Here he simply repudiated the second charge, and added, <span class="cmt_word">But I honour my Father,</span> in declaring that these words of his would be acceptable to you if you were of God (ver. 47), <span class="cmt_word">and</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> strengthens the contrast between the two clauses rather than between: the "I" and "you") - and, while I am doing honour to my Father, <span class="cmt_word">ye are dishonouring me;</span> for you are casting these reproaches upon me, refusing my offers of mercy, freedom, and life, veritable revelations though they be of the heart of the Father. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:48-53 Observe Christ's disregard of the applause of men. those who are dead to the praises of men can bear their contempt. God will seek the honour of all who do not seek their own. In these verses we have the doctrine of the everlasting happiness of believers. We have the character of a believer; he is one that keeps the sayings of the Lord Jesus. And the privilege of a believer; he shall by no means see death for ever. Though now they cannot avoid seeing death, and tasting it also, yet they shall shortly be where it will be no more forever, Ex 14:13.</body></html>
