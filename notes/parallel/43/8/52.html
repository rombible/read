In that sense they were impossible, for they are contradicted by the fact that death came to the great Patriarch and the prophets, and if to them, then surely, much more to ordinary men. They regard it as conclusive that their assertion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?">John 8:48</a> is correct. No one, except a man under the influence of a demon, would make an assertion so opposed to the almost unbroken experience of mankind.<p><span class= "bld">If a man keep my saying.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">If a man keep My word,</span> as in last verse.<p><span class= "bld">He shall never taste of death.</span>--The expression is stronger than that which He had used, "shall never see death." They use it to put in the strongest way their wonder at the impossible promise which He had uttered. It has occurred before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.">Matthew 16:28</a>. (See Note there.) It occurs again in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews</span> - the adverse dominant party, ready always to misunderstand his words - (then) <span class="cmt_word">said to him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> - in reference to their own charge (ver. 48), which he had solemnly disclaimed - <span class="cmt_word">we know</span> (<span class="accented">we have come to know</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that thou hast a daemon.</span> They imply that he must be under some most bewildering hallucination. These words have scattered their momentary hesitation. They must have reasoned thus: "He who claims such power for his own words must have personal immunity from death. This is a daemoniacal folly and delusion. There have been greater than he who heard and kept the words of <span class="accented">God</span>, and who, nevertheless, did not escape death." <span class="cmt_word">Abraham died, and the prophets</span> (died); <span class="cmt_word">and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.</span> Here observe the wilful alteration of the Saviour's words.

The believer, even like the Lord, does <span class="accented">taste</span> of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>), but he does not <span class="accented">see</span> it. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, is a rabbinical one for "drinking the cup of death" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:48-53 Observe Christ's disregard of the applause of men. those who are dead to the praises of men can bear their contempt. God will seek the honour of all who do not seek their own. In these verses we have the doctrine of the everlasting happiness of believers. We have the character of a believer; he is one that keeps the sayings of the Lord Jesus. And the privilege of a believer; he shall by no means see death for ever. Though now they cannot avoid seeing death, and tasting it also, yet they shall shortly be where it will be no more forever, Ex 14:13.</body></html>
