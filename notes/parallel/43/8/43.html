A good instance of the meaning of "speech is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-73.htm" title="And after a while came to him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech denudes you.">Matthew 26:73</a>, "thy speech betrayeth thee." From <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33</a> onwards, they had constantly misunderstood His expressions. The reason is that the subject-matter of His discourse is altogether above them. He is speaking of spiritual things, which are spiritually discerned. They, if children of the Father whom they claimed, would recognise these spiritual truths and know the language of home.<p><span class= "bld">Ye cannot hear.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-60.htm" title="Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?">John 6:60</a>. The sense is, "Ye cannot hear, so as to receive and obey." He supplies the answer to His own question. In the following verses (44-47), He expresses this answer more fully.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why do ye not understand</span> - come to appreciate and penetrate the significance of - <span class="cmt_word">my speech?</span> There is delicate subtle distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, corresponding to that between <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>. The former word connotes the form, manner, and tone of utterance, and the latter its inner substance and power. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> is a, word used for any manifestation of sound, a voice, the babble of children, the cries and songs of beasts or birds, for which purpose <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f72;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> are not used (Trench, 'Syn. of N.T.'). Peter's <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> betrayed him to the Jerusalem crowd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>). <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the substance of the message, the burden of the revelation. The speech (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>) of Christ refers to the appropriate and significant clothing which he gave to his word (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). He mournfully asks why they had failed to get to understand the method of his converse; why they perpetually failed to appreciate his discourse; why they persistently put wrong constructions upon his phrase, and imagined him to be speaking of earthly things when he was discoursing to them of heavenly ones. Why? <span class="cmt_word">Because ye cannot hear my word -</span> the Divine communication I have made to you. They were morally so far from him that they could not listen so as to receive his revelation. The inward organ of receptivity was lacking, and "so the spiritual idiom in which he spake was not spiritually understood" (Alford). The Divine significance of the whole word of Christ, the new and strange doctrines of Messiah, of redemption, of the Father, of a sacrifice and death on the part of the Son of man for the salvation of the world excited their animosity and bitter antipathies. They were not conscious of any of the need he came to satisfy, and so they failed to apprehend the entire manner of his revelation. They were from beneath (ver. 23). He is disclosing heavenly things. "Their ears have they closed, lest they should hear." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:41-47 Satan prompts men to excesses by which they murder themselves and others, while what he puts into the mind tends to ruin men's souls. He is the great promoter of falsehood of every kind. He is a liar, all his temptations are carried on by his calling evil good, and good evil, and promising freedom in sin. He is the author of all lies; whom liars resemble and obey, with whom all liars shall have their portion for ever. The special lusts of the devil are spiritual wickedness, the lusts of the mind, and corrupt reasonings, pride and envy, wrath and malice, enmity to good, and enticing others to evil. By the truth, here understand the revealed will of God as to the salvation of men by Jesus Christ, the truth Christ was now preaching, and which the Jews opposed.</body></html>
