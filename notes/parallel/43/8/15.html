"You on your part . . . I for My part." We must beware of the common mistake of finding the origin of this thought of judgment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-10.htm" title="When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those your accusers? has no man condemned you?">John 8:10-11</a>, which as we have seen do not belong to this context. It arises rather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-13.htm" title="The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true.">John 8:13</a>. The statement of the Pharisees, "Thou art bearing witness concerning Thyself; Thy witness is not true," was a condemnatory judgment based upon appearances. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-24.htm" title="Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.">John 7:24</a>.) They allowed these appearances to carry them away from a righteous judgment. They looked at the form of human flesh, and declared His witness false. Had they listened to the words He spoke, and judged according to their spiritual meaning, they would have heard the voice of the Messiah and have seen the Light of the world.<p>This thought of the Pharisees, in their ignorance judging that which they knew not, suggests by contrast the thought that He. in perfect knowledge judges no one. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-17.htm" title="For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.">John 3:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">You judge</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you condemn me, you repudiate my claim to be the "Living Water" and the "Light of the world" - <span class="cmt_word">after the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>), according to the outward appearance; you look at my mere humanity. Our Lord did not accuse them of the fleshly, blinded, unjust judgments of unregenerate men. The article <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, and not the well known formula <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, prevents such an interpretation. He rather reasons and pleads with them. He suggests that they might, if they would, look below the surface of his flesh. Tim evangelist, who reports the substance of this discussion, has written. "The Word was made flesh." So if the incarnate Word had always been judged "after the flesh," we should never have seen his glory, nor recognized the nobler part of his Personality. <span class="cmt_word">I judge no man</span>. Numerous efforts have been made to find the underlying modification of this assertion. Augustine, Chrysostom, Cyril, and many moderns add, "after the flesh," or "as you do" (the latter is the suggestion of Lucke, which, as Meyer says, comes to the same thing), or "now," pointing on to the actual assumption of his judiciary powers at the consummation of all things, and contrasting his earthly ministry of mercy with the ultimate majesty of his judgment throne (Westcott). Storr, Moulton, Godet. suggest "I by myself" - I alone, independently of the Father, judge no man. Meyer rejects all these attempts to add to the text, and maintains that our Lord is claiming the lofty position of Saviour rather than Judge. He came with that as his primary aim, purpose, intent; to heal, not to wound; to save, not to destroy; to give time for repentance, not to hurry sinners to their doom; to illumine, not to cover with darkness. Yet even Meyer admits a practical exception of great importance to be involved in the next clause, which does not differ from Westcott's interpretation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:12-16 Christ is the Light of the world. God is light, and Christ is the image of the invisible God. One sun enlightens the whole world; so does one Christ, and there needs no more. What a dark dungeon would the world be without the sun! So would it be without Jesus, by whom light came into the world. Those who follow Christ shall not walk in darkness. They shall not be left without the truths which are necessary to keep them from destroying error, and the directions in the way of duty, necessary to keep them from condemning sin.</body></html>
