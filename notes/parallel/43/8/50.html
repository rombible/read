They dishonoured Him. This to one who sought His own glory would have been matter of concern. For Him whose whole life was one of self-denial, their dishonour finds nothing which it can wound. His words repeat what He had taught them before. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-41.htm" title="I receive not honor from men.">John 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-18.htm" title="He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.">John 7:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">There is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>. The thought here is that though He Himself seeks not His own glory, the Father seeketh for the honour of the Son, and judgeth between Him and those who dishonour Him. The result of the judgment as to those who keep not His word is expressed in the next verse; and as to Himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-10.htm" title="Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;">John 16:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>, in honouring my Father, and in quietly bearing your unjustifiable reproaches, <span class="cmt_word">I am not seeking my glory</span> (cf. vers. 28, 42; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-18.htm">John 7:18</a>). The claim of Christ to be and do so much is made because he has the happiness of the world, the salvation and life of men, and the glory of the Father as his consuming passion. He is not seeking his own glory; he is only crowning himself with the crown of utter self-abnegation. But, while he repudiates all care for his own glory, he knows that, <span class="cmt_word">there is One</span> to whom that glory is dear, <span class="cmt_word">who seeketh</span> his glory, and with whom it is perfectly safe, <span class="cmt_word">and who judgeth</span> with absolute impartiality and infinite knowledge. Westcott quotes in illustration of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Philo on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>, "He that seeketh [maketh inquisition for blood] is not man, but God, or the Logos, or the Divine Law" ('De Jos.,' 29). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:48-53 Observe Christ's disregard of the applause of men. those who are dead to the praises of men can bear their contempt. God will seek the honour of all who do not seek their own. In these verses we have the doctrine of the everlasting happiness of believers. We have the character of a believer; he is one that keeps the sayings of the Lord Jesus. And the privilege of a believer; he shall by no means see death for ever. Though now they cannot avoid seeing death, and tasting it also, yet they shall shortly be where it will be no more forever, Ex 14:13.</body></html>
