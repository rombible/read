They feel that the sad news needs no addition, and that there is no necessity for a prayer for help. Weakness, conscious of strength which loves, needs but to utter itself. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-21.htm" title="Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.">John 11:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">lovest is sick</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> nominative to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>). The sisters knew well what peril Jesus and his disciples would encounter by coming to Bethany, and they must have known that he could have healed him by a word; so they simply state the case. (On the difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, see notes on John 5:20; 21:15, 17. Trench, 'New Test. Syn.,' &sect; 12. The former word is that of personal affection and fondness, though occasion ally having grander associations and equivalent to <span class="accented">amo</span>, while <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> is equivalent <span class="accented">to diligo</span>, and means the love of choice, of sentiment, of confidence and esteem.) There is delicate tact and beauty in the use of the two words, one by the sisters, the other by the evangelist. The statement of needs, the simple voice of our weakness, the infant's cry, goes up to heaven. The bleat of the lost lamb is enough for the good Shepherd. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 It is no new thing for those whom Christ loves, to be sick; bodily distempers correct the corruption, and try the graces of God's people. He came not to preserve his people from these afflictions, but to save them from their sins, and from the wrath to come; however, it behoves us to apply to Him in behalf of our friends and relatives when sick and afflicted. Let this reconcile us to the darkest dealings of Providence, that they are all for the glory of God: sickness, loss, disappointment, are so; and if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied. Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. The families are greatly favoured in which love and peace abound; but those are most happy whom Jesus loves, and by whom he is beloved. Alas, that this should seldom be the case with every person, even in small families. God has gracious intentions, even when he seems to delay. When the work of deliverance, temporal or spiritual, public or personal, is delayed, it does but stay for the right time.</body></html>
