Three of them, indeed, had heard our Lord apply the word "sleep" to death before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-24.htm" title="He said to them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.">Matthew 9:24</a>), but this instance of misunderstanding on their part takes its place with others of a like kind, as showing that the surface meaning of words was that which naturally suggested itself to them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6-12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-38.htm" title="And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.">Luke 22:38</a>) It is not likely that all "the three" were present during this interview. If it took place at <span class= "ital">Tellanihje,</span> then the nearness of Bethsaida and <span class= "ital">the</span> other towns of Galilee may have led some of the Twelve to visit their old homes. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-48.htm" title="Nathanael said to him, From where know you me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.">John 1:48</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) We can hardly imagine that Peter was present without taking a prominent part in the conversation, or that Thomas would have been in his presence the representative speaker (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-16.htm" title="Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.">John 11:16</a>). His absence may be taken as one of the reasons why the account of the miracle which follows is absent from St. Mark's Gospel, which is, like St. John's, the Gospel of an eye-witness. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Mark,</span> p. 189, and <span class= "ital">Excursus E: The Omission of the Raising of Lazarus, in the Synoptic Gospels.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, though in the present tense, represents a time anterior to the time of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is found in Ecclus. 46:19. This is an explanation of the misunderstanding, occasioned, perhaps, by the statement of ver. 4, and further elucidated by what follows. A difference prevails between <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as both words are used for sleep; but the former has rather the idea of the repose accompanying sleep, the latter the phenomenon itself. With one or two exceptions, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is always used in the New Testament of the sleep of death, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> never. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:11-16 Since we are sure to rise again at the last, why should not the believing hope of that resurrection to eternal life, make it as easy for us to put off the body and die, as it is to put off our clothes and go to sleep? A true Christian, when he dies, does but sleep; he rests from the labours of the past day. Nay, herein death is better than sleep, that sleep is only a short rest, but death is the end of earthly cares and toils. The disciples thought that it was now needless for Christ to go to Lazarus, and expose himself and them. Thus we often hope that the good work we are called to do, will be done by some other hand, if there be peril in the doing of it. But when Christ raised Lazarus from the dead, many were brought to believe on him; and there was much done to make perfect the faith of those that believed. Let us go to him; death cannot separate from the love of Christ, nor put us out of the reach of his call. Like Thomas, in difficult times Christians should encourage one another. The dying of the Lord Jesus should make us willing to die whenever God calls us.</body></html>
