The passage is a good illustration of St. John's use of the term, for He was of course among Jews, in the ordinary meaning of the word, during the sojourn at Ephraim. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But went thence unto a country near to the wilderness.</span>--All the better MSS. read "unto the country . . ." as in contrast to the city, Jerusalem, where "the Jews" dwelt. He went from Bethany, when He had heard of what had taken place at Jerusalem, "into the country." This is further defined as "near to the wilderness," and then the name of the city is given.<p><span class= "bld">Into a city called Ephraim.</span>--The position of this "city" is not known. The MSS. spell it variously as <span class= "ital">Ephraim, Ephrem, Ephram,</span> and <span class= "ital">Ephratha.</span> Eusebius and Jerome both assumed it to be the same place as Ephron, but differed as to its position, the former fixing it at eight, and the latter at twenty miles, north-east from Jerusalem. Both would place it, therefore, in Judaea; and this agrees with its position "near to the wilderness," for the desert of Judaea extended nearly as far as Jericho. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm" title="And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.">2Chronicles 13:19</a>, we have an Ephrain or Ephron (according to the written text and the LXX.) in connection with the neighbourhood of Bethel. This is mentioned by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iv. 9, ? 9), and is near to the wilderness of Bethaven. It is possibly the place named here; but a Jew would naturally use the phrase, "the wilderness," to mean the desert of Judaea. Dr. Robinson would identify Ephraim and Ephron with Ophrah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm" title="And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,">Joshua 18:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-23.htm" title="And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.">1Samuel 17:23</a>), and fix the locality at the modern <span class= "ital">el-Taiyibeh,</span> four or five miles east from Bethel, and sixteen from Jerusalem, which would agree roughly with the position assigned by Jerome. We must be content to leave the matter in this uncertainty. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Note</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.">Luke 17:11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - This constituted the close of his earthly ministry after his ordinary method. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore walked</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-1.htm">John 7:1</a>) <span class="cmt_word">no more openly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-4.htm">John 7:4</a>) a<span class="cmt_word">mong the Jews; but he deputed thence into the country nigh unto the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim</span>. Westcott says the place is mentioned in connection with Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>). Not far from Bethel, on the border between Benjamin and Ephraim, is <span class="accented">Taiyibeh</span> a conical hill with a village perched aloft, which Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:127) and Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 210) identify with this Ephraim. In this form the word does not appear in the Old Testament, but Ensebius and Jerome make it twelve miles from Jerusalem, on the east of the road leading to Sichem; and Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 4:09.9) speaks of "two little towns of Bethela and Ephraim, through which Vespasian passed and left garrisons." Hengstenberg identifies it with "Baal-hazor, which is by Ephraim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23</a>). The maps of Van der Welt and of the Palestine Exploration Society place it on the site of Ephraim, Ephron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>), or Ophrah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>), about seven miles north-east from Bethel, and give as second designation Apharaim. The intelligence must have reached our Lord that the Sanhedrin had formally pronounced sentence against him. This may have induced him to retire from Jerusalem until the next great feast, when he would publicly challenge their allegiance. From this neighborhood our Lord could (as we learn from the synoptists) have easily joined the caravan from Persea, which, after crossing Jordan near Jericho, there set its face towards Jerusalem, or the caravan which may have come through Samaria to Bethel. <span class="cmt_word">There he abode a</span> (<span class="accented">tarried</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with the disciples</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> (says Godet) is not synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;</span>, but equivalent to - he confined himself in the desert region north-east of Jerusalem to the company of the twelve. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:54-57 Before our gospel passover we must renew our repentance. Thus by a voluntary purification, and by religious exercises, many, more devout than their neighbours, spent some time before the passover at Jerusalem. When we expect to meet God, we must solemnly prepare. No devices of man can alter the purposes of God: and while hypocrites amuse themselves with forms and disputes, and worldly men pursue their own plans, Jesus still orders all things for his own glory and the salvation of his people.</body></html>
