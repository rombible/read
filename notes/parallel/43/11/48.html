Another such miracle in the city itself would carry conviction, they think, to the minds of all.<p><span class= "bld">And the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</span>--The dread of the Roman power must have been constantly present to the Jews of that generation. They had seen Archelaus deposed, and a Roman procurator had come to carry into effect the enrolment decreed by Augustus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>). Pontius Pilate had suppressed outbreaks by violence in the Temple itself. There had been tumults in connection with the Corban money and with Barabbas. The Temple mountain was the site of the Roman fortress Antonia, and this dread power may at any moment destroy the national life, which only existed on sufferance.<p>The attempts to prove that "our place" can mean "the Temple" must now be given up; and if we attach a local meaning to the word we must understand it of Jerusalem. It may, however, be questioned whether the word has any local signification here. Like our words "standing," and "place," and "position," it certainly may have a moral sense, and New Testament examples of this usage are frequent. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-25.htm" title="That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.">Acts 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm" title="Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?">1Corinthians 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-17.htm" title="For you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.">Hebrews 12:17</a>.) It is suggested that this sense is more in harmony with the feeling of the Pharisees. They possessed no local power; and the city could not be taken away from them more entirely than it already was. Their existence as rulers depended upon the Mosaic law and upon the services of the Temple. Round these centres they had gathered human tradition and ordinance, to which they clung because they only could interpret them, and they only could use the vast powers which were thus exercised over men. The Law had become practically an intricate system of tradition, and the Temple-service had become practically an intricate system of ritual. With this the Roman empire, following its usual policy, had not interfered, and the Jewish hierarchy had become the centre and the rulers of the national life. But in direct opposition to both of them had been the work and teaching of Christ. He had sought to establish for law and service the simplicity of their first spiritual principles. His spiritual teaching was a cutting to the very root of their whole being. If all the people believed on Him their <span class= "ital">raison d'etre</span> would be gone, and the Romans would no longer suffer an <span class= "ital">imperium in imperio,</span> which they now allowed because it swayed the masses of the people. They would take both their position, and with it the rank which they still claimed as a nation.<p>The emphatic position of the word "our" should be noted, and also that "place and nation" are linked together as one complex thought attached to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If we let him alone thus,</span> as we have been doing hitherto - if we suffer him to do these things - <span class="cmt_word">all men will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away</span> from us, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from the Sanhedrin, from the lawful rulers in all matters affecting religious order or privilege, <span class="cmt_word">our place</span> - the city or temple - <span class="cmt_word">and the nation</span>, which we rule through our subordinates and surrogates, but to accomplish which we shall prove our incompetence if we cannot keep down all insubordination and hold perilous enthusiasm in check. De Wette and Hengstenberg strongly urge that by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was meant the temple, "the dwelling-place and seat of the whole people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-4.htm">Psalm 84:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>). Ewald, Godet, Meyer, Watkins, consider <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to be the city, the seat of all the power of the nation, spiritual and civil. The nation was a province of the Roman empire, but the hierarchy was still invested with great powers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:47-53 There can hardly be a more clear discovery of the madness that is in man's heart, and of its desperate enmity against God, than what is here recorded. Words of prophecy in the mouth, are not clear evidence of a principle of grace in the heart. The calamity we seek to escape by sin, we take the most effectual course to bring upon our own heads; as those do who think by opposing Christ's kingdom, to advance their own worldly interest. The fear of the wicked shall come upon them. The conversion of souls is the gathering of them to Christ as their ruler and refuge; and he died to effect this. By dying he purchased them to himself, and the gift of the Holy Ghost for them: his love in dying for believers should unite them closely together.</body></html>
