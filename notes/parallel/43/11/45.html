This clause may be read so as to include those who went to communicate the startling intelligence to the Pharisees among the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> of the Jews who went to comfort Mary and who "believed;" on the ground that <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is in apposition with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, not (according to the text of D, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) with <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. This, however, would imply that all of them believed, and that the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> went to the Pharisees with no hostile intent (Meyer); but why should not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> refer to the <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, implying another set not of the friends of Mary (Godet)? The remark would then be in harmony with the fact to which the evangelist continually calls attention, that Christ's miracles and words produced a twofold effect, and made a frequent division among the Jews, thus bringing to light who were and who were not his true disciples. The same facts excited faith in some and roused animosity in others. The great sign has been dividing men into hostile camps ever since. As Browning's Arab physician said- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"'Tis well to keep back nothing of a case.<br />This man (Lazarus) so cured regards the Curer then<br />As - God forgive me - who but God himself,<br />Creator and Sustainer of the world,<br />That came and dwelt in flesh on it awhile...<br />The very God! Think, Abib; dost thou think?<br />So the All-great were the All-loving too;<br />So through the thunder comes a human voice,<br />Saying, 'O heart I maple, a heart beats here!<br />Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself.'"</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:33-46 Christ's tender sympathy with these afflicted friends, appeared by the troubles of his spirit. In all the afflictions of believers he is afflicted. His concern for them was shown by his kind inquiry after the remains of his deceased friend. Being found in fashion as a man, he acts in the way and manner of the sons of men. It was shown by his tears. He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. Tears of compassion resemble those of Christ. But Christ never approved that sensibility of which many are proud, while they weep at mere tales of distress, but are hardened to real woe. He sets us an example to withdraw from scenes of giddy mirth, that we may comfort the afflicted. And we have not a High Priest who cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities. It is a good step toward raising a soul to spiritual life, when the stone is taken away, when prejudices are removed, and got over, and way is made for the word to enter the heart. If we take Christ's word, and rely on his power and faithfulness, we shall see the glory of God, and be happy in the sight. Our Lord Jesus has taught us, by his own example, to call God Father, in prayer, and to draw nigh to him as children to a father, with humble reverence, yet with holy boldness. He openly made this address to God, with uplifted eyes and loud voice, that they might be convinced the Father had sent him as his beloved Son into the world. He could have raised Lazarus by the silent exertion of his power and will, and the unseen working of the Spirit of life; but he did it by a loud call. This was a figure of the gospel call, by which dead souls are brought out of the grave of sin: and of the sound of the archangel's trumpet at the last day, with which all that sleep in the dust shall be awakened, and summoned before the great tribunal. The grave of sin and this world, is no place for those whom Christ has quickened; they must come forth. Lazarus was thoroughly revived, and returned not only to life, but to health. The sinner cannot quicken his own soul, but he is to use the means of grace; the believer cannot sanctify himself, but he is to lay aside every weight and hinderance. We cannot convert our relatives and friends, but we should instruct, warn, and invite them.</body></html>
