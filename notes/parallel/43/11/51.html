Writing after the events, he has seen them fulfilled, and regards them as an unconscious prophecy. Like another Balaam, Caiaphas was the oracle or God in spite of himself, and there is in his words a meaning far beyond any that he had intended.<p><span class= "bld">Being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation.</span>--He stood, therefore, in a relation which made him the official representative of God to the people, and gave him an official capacity to convey God's truth. This was represented in the days of Samuel by the Urim and Thummim; and John, himself a Jew, still thinks of the high priest's breast as bearing the oracle which declared the will of God, whatever unworthy human thoughts may have filled the heart beneath. It may be that another reference to the high priest's office is present in these thrice-written words. It was the high priest's duty to "enter within the veil," and "make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year" (Leviticus 16). In that year the veil was rent, and the first step taken by which the holy place was destroyed, and the high priest's office ceased to exist. With the destruction of the holy place the Jewish day of Atonement lost its significance, but the high priest that year, by his counsel and action in the Sanhedrin, was causing the sacrifice which should be presented by another high priest, in the Holy of Holies as an Atonement for the world--"Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 51, 52.</span> - The evangelist discerned the presence of a deeper meaning in his words not intended by himself. As Balaam and Nebuchadnezzar and even Pharaoh had uttered unconscious or unwilling prophecies, and as in all genuine prophecies there are <span class="accented">meanings meant</span> by God beyond what the utterer of them at all conceived possible. So here. <span class="cmt_word">This he spake not from himself: but being high priest that awful, critical year, he prophesied</span>. The high priest was believed in ancient times to have the power of drawing from Urim and Thummim the Divine decisions as to future events (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>, and Caiaphas, as priest-prophet, may thus have conveyed an awful and sublime truth through base and evil dispositions. Curious instances occur elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27, 35</a>): "He saved others; himself he cannot save!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-31.htm">Mark 15:31</a>); when the people said, "His blood be upon us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a>); when Pilate, by unconscious prophecy, ironically declared him to be "King of the Jews" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-37.htm">Matthew 27:37</a>). Wunsche quotes a curious case of unconscious prophecy, which the rabbinical writers attributed to Pharaoh's daughter, when she forecast the future legislator in the infant derelict. The substance of the prophetic word extracted from his saying was that <span class="cmt_word">Jesus should die for the nation.</span> Hengstenberg wisely <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">Caiaphas</span> could not have spoken other than of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>." When John wrote, the difference between the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> had vanished away. Israel had become an <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, like the rest. <span class="cmt_word">And not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the children of God scattered abroad</span> - constitute a new center, life-giving and sacred in the covenant of his blood (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>, a very remarkable parallelism). Who are the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>? According to some, the dispersed Israelites, but surely the passage corresponds with the "other sheep," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>, and refers to all who enter by living faith in <span class="accented">him</span> into the full realization of the Divine Fatherhood (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>) and their own sonship. Christ is the true Union of Jew and Gentile. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:47-53 There can hardly be a more clear discovery of the madness that is in man's heart, and of its desperate enmity against God, than what is here recorded. Words of prophecy in the mouth, are not clear evidence of a principle of grace in the heart. The calamity we seek to escape by sin, we take the most effectual course to bring upon our own heads; as those do who think by opposing Christ's kingdom, to advance their own worldly interest. The fear of the wicked shall come upon them. The conversion of souls is the gathering of them to Christ as their ruler and refuge; and he died to effect this. By dying he purchased them to himself, and the gift of the Holy Ghost for them: his love in dying for believers should unite them closely together.</body></html>
