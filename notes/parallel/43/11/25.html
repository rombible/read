She thinks and speaks of Lazarus as dead. He asserts that in the true thought of the spiritual life the fact of physical death does not interrupt that life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection</span>. Not merely that God will give me what I ask, but that I am in some sense already his gift to man of <span class="accented">resurrection</span>, inasmuch as <span class="cmt_word">I am</span> that of <span class="cmt_word">Life</span>. (So Luthardt and Godet, but not Meyer, who makes <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;</span> the positive result of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>.) By taking humanity into his Person, Christ reveals the permanence of human individuality, that is, of such individuality as is in union with himself. He associates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) "the Life" which he gives with" the Way" and "the Truth," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. with the whole sum of human experience and of human meditation and speculation, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. with all the conduct of the will and the mind. <span class="cmt_word">He that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live.</span> In these words he identifies the "life" with the transfiguration of the bodily life. The grand method of this blessed <span class="accented">life</span> is faith. The life which is the condition and ground of resurrection is the natural consequence of a faith which accepts Christ, and identifies itself with him. But "there are some who have believed, and have what you call died" - <span class="accented">though they die</span>, <span class="accented">they shall live</span>. In such cases, so-called "death" is veritable "life." The life of faith will survive the shock of death, <span class="cmt_word">and whosoever liveth, and believeth on me, shall never die</span> - shall never taste of death (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51, 8</a>:51). This is no new teaching for the more thoughtful of his hearers. There are multitudes now believing (and therefore living) in him. They shall <span class="accented">never die</span> in the sense in which death has been hitherto regarded; <span class="accented">they shall by no means die forever</span>. Faith is eternal life: death is only a momentary shadow upon a life which is far better. Whether the corruption of the grave passes over the believer or not, he lives an eternal life, which has no element of death nor proclivity to death in it. So far the Lord is lifting Martha to a higher experience of life and a comparative in difference to death. Before he offers any further consolation, he probes to the quick her faith in him and in the eternal life. <span class="cmt_word">Believest thou this?</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>; "Is <span class="accented">this</span> thy belief?" not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>; "Dost thou believe in my statement?" "Believest thou that the Resurrection which <span class="accented">I am</span> and which <span class="accented">I give</span> can thus transform for thee the whole meaning of death?" The fullness of life after death is assured in virtue of the resurrection which Christ could effect at any moment, and will eventually effect for all. This <span class="accented">life</span> of which Christ speaks may be the life which is the consequence of the resurrection (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of man effected in the Incarnation, or it may be the condition of "resurrection" and sufficient proof that, if a man receive it by faith, he is free' from all the curse of physical death, and assured of a perfect victory over it. So also the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> may either mean "not forever," and thus the words may be taken to refer to the resurrection. "He will not forever die," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. death may supervene, but will be conquered; or <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> may mean "never," "in no wise," and the "never die" may refer to spiritual death, overlooking physical death altogether. The whole narrative is a great parable of life through death. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:17-32 Here was a house where the fear of God was, and on which his blessing rested; yet it was made a house of mourning. Grace will keep sorrow from the heart, but not from the house. When God, by his grace and providence, is coming towards us in ways of mercy and comfort, we should, like Martha, go forth by faith, hope, and prayer, to meet him. When Martha went to meet Jesus, Mary sat still in the house; this temper formerly had been an advantage to her, when it put her at Christ's feet to hear his word; but in the day of affliction, the same temper disposed her to melancholy. It is our wisdom to watch against the temptations, and to make use of the advantages of our natural tempers. When we know not what in particular to ask or expect, let us refer ourselves to God; let him do as seemeth him good. To enlarge Martha's expectations, our Lord declared himself to be the Resurrection and the Life. In every sense he is the Resurrection; the source, the substance, the first-fruits, the cause of it. The redeemed soul lives after death in happiness; and after the resurrection, both body and soul are kept from all evil for ever. When we have read or heard the word of Christ, about the great things of the other world, we should put it to ourselves, Do we believe this truth? The crosses and comforts of this present time would not make such a deep impression upon us as they do, if we believed the things of eternity as we ought. When Christ our Master comes, he calls for us. He comes in his word and ordinances, and calls us to them, calls us by them, calls us to himself. Those who, in a day of peace, set themselves at Christ's feet to be taught by him, may with comfort, in a day of trouble, cast themselves at his feet, to find favour with him.</body></html>
