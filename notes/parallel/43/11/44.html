But this seems not to be necessary, and if not necessary, is not to be resorted to. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-21.htm" title="Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land where they went.">John 6:21</a>.) The grave-clothes may have been bound round the limbs separately, as in the Egyptian mummies, and this would not prevent motion; or (and this is more probable) the body may have been "wrapped in a linen cloth," which encompassed the whole, except the head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-59.htm" title="And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,">Matthew 27:59</a>), but still left motion possible. The word rendered "grave-clothes" is used nowhere in the New Testament except in this passage. It means properly the bands or straps by which the linen sheet was fastened to the body, and which kept the spice from falling out. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-40.htm" title="Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.">John 19:40</a>.) We find it used elsewhere for straps and thongs generally. They were made of rushes, linen,, and other materials. The word is used once in the Greek of the Old Testament, where it means the belts by which beds are girded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-16.htm" title="I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.">Proverbs 7:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And his face was bound about with a napkin.</span>--For the word "napkin," comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-20.htm" title="And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:">Luke 19:20</a>. It means here the cloth placed round the forehead and under the chin, but probably not covering the face.<p><span class= "bld">Loose him, and let him go.</span>--This command is in itself strong proof that the earlier part of the verse is not to be interpreted as a narrative of miraculous incidents.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that</span> (had died and) <span class="cmt_word">was</span> (up to that time) <span class="cmt_word">dead, came out</span> (of the grave), <span class="cmt_word">bound feet and hands with grave-bands</span>. The swathing of the limbs after the Egyptian fashion, each limb separately, renders the action most natural, because <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is used. Lazarus did not simply stand in his grave. The early commentators and Stier saw in this emergence of the swathed Lazarus an additional miracle, just as they augmented the force of the supposition involved in the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, into the fact that our Lord raised from death a putrefy-tug corpse. Both suppositions would be unnecessary adjuncts of the proof of the glory of God and power of Christ. Lucke and others refer to the habit of swathing separate limbs, but in such a way as not to impede motion if the person thus swathed desired it. Meyer and Godet see no necessity for the suggestion of the early writers. Kuinoel thinks that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> was used of the mere struggle of the swathed body to escape. The above supposition is the most probable. So Westcott.

The surrounding of the face with a <span class="accented">sudarium</span> is the touch of an eyewitness. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and suffer him to depart</span>; the part which bystanders might perform; this was the wise advice of Friend and Teacher. (For similar injunctions of a physical and practical kind on other occasions, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-15.htm">Luke 7:15</a> and Luke 8:55.) The majestic miracle is no further pressed by the evangelist, but left to tell its own sublime meaning, which in the multiplicity of exegetical hypotheses we are in danger of missing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Behold a man raised up by Christ.<br />The rest remaineth unrevealed -<br />He told it not; or something sealed<br />The lips of that evangelist."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:33-46 Christ's tender sympathy with these afflicted friends, appeared by the troubles of his spirit. In all the afflictions of believers he is afflicted. His concern for them was shown by his kind inquiry after the remains of his deceased friend. Being found in fashion as a man, he acts in the way and manner of the sons of men. It was shown by his tears. He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. Tears of compassion resemble those of Christ. But Christ never approved that sensibility of which many are proud, while they weep at mere tales of distress, but are hardened to real woe. He sets us an example to withdraw from scenes of giddy mirth, that we may comfort the afflicted. And we have not a High Priest who cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities. It is a good step toward raising a soul to spiritual life, when the stone is taken away, when prejudices are removed, and got over, and way is made for the word to enter the heart. If we take Christ's word, and rely on his power and faithfulness, we shall see the glory of God, and be happy in the sight. Our Lord Jesus has taught us, by his own example, to call God Father, in prayer, and to draw nigh to him as children to a father, with humble reverence, yet with holy boldness. He openly made this address to God, with uplifted eyes and loud voice, that they might be convinced the Father had sent him as his beloved Son into the world. He could have raised Lazarus by the silent exertion of his power and will, and the unseen working of the Spirit of life; but he did it by a loud call. This was a figure of the gospel call, by which dead souls are brought out of the grave of sin: and of the sound of the archangel's trumpet at the last day, with which all that sleep in the dust shall be awakened, and summoned before the great tribunal. The grave of sin and this world, is no place for those whom Christ has quickened; they must come forth. Lazarus was thoroughly revived, and returned not only to life, but to health. The sinner cannot quicken his own soul, but he is to use the means of grace; the believer cannot sanctify himself, but he is to lay aside every weight and hinderance. We cannot convert our relatives and friends, but we should instruct, warn, and invite them.</body></html>
