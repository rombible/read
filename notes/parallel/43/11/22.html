She had heard probably of the young maid whose body was reanimated by the life which had but just left it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-35.htm" title="While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Your daughter is dead: why trouble you the Master any further?">Mark 5:35</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/8-41.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and sought him that he would come into his house:">Luke 8:41-42</a>), and of the young man whose body was being carried to the grave, when at His command it was restored living to the widowed mother. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-11.htm" title="And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.">Luke 7:11</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) Her brother had been the friend of Jesus; they had all trusted in His power and His love. Words had come to them from Him telling that this sickness should not issue in death, but that it should further God's glory and glorify the Son. And now He <span class= "ital">is</span> Himself present. His words cannot fail, and He Himself cannot be there without a purpose. She dare not say more; but she rests in this, that there is unity of power and will between Him and the Father. Whatsoever He asks, God will give.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And even now I know, that whatsoever thing thou shalt ask of God, God will give it thee.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> may be contrasted with ver. 27. In his presence she knows intuitively that nothing is impossible. The <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span> is a word of more human quality than that which our Lord customarily used for <span class="accented">his own</span> appeals to God. He spoke of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>, to seek as an equal; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>,, <span class="accented">to</span> intercede for another; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to pray; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to supplicate. It was appropriate enough that Martha should use the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>. Her word was a burst of excited feeling, and does not dictate to the Master what he should do. Her twofold mention of the name of God with "thou" and "thee," shows that she had not risen to highest light on the Lord's mysterious relation to the Father. She speaks of him and to him as of a strangely gifted human Friend. But she had doubtless heard of the widow of Nain, and of Jairus's daughter, and she made no irrational suggestion. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> covers much. Jesus loved Lazarus. He was Friend to the whole group, and known to them all. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:17-32 Here was a house where the fear of God was, and on which his blessing rested; yet it was made a house of mourning. Grace will keep sorrow from the heart, but not from the house. When God, by his grace and providence, is coming towards us in ways of mercy and comfort, we should, like Martha, go forth by faith, hope, and prayer, to meet him. When Martha went to meet Jesus, Mary sat still in the house; this temper formerly had been an advantage to her, when it put her at Christ's feet to hear his word; but in the day of affliction, the same temper disposed her to melancholy. It is our wisdom to watch against the temptations, and to make use of the advantages of our natural tempers. When we know not what in particular to ask or expect, let us refer ourselves to God; let him do as seemeth him good. To enlarge Martha's expectations, our Lord declared himself to be the Resurrection and the Life. In every sense he is the Resurrection; the source, the substance, the first-fruits, the cause of it. The redeemed soul lives after death in happiness; and after the resurrection, both body and soul are kept from all evil for ever. When we have read or heard the word of Christ, about the great things of the other world, we should put it to ourselves, Do we believe this truth? The crosses and comforts of this present time would not make such a deep impression upon us as they do, if we believed the things of eternity as we ought. When Christ our Master comes, he calls for us. He comes in his word and ordinances, and calls us to them, calls us by them, calls us to himself. Those who, in a day of peace, set themselves at Christ's feet to be taught by him, may with comfort, in a day of trouble, cast themselves at his feet, to find favour with him.</body></html>
