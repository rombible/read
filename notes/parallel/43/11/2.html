Still, the other Evangelists had not told the name, and St. John, when the name first occurs in his narrative, connects it with the person whose deed of love was known to all.<p>There is no sufficient reason for identifying Mary of Bethany with the "woman which was a sinner" (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> or for identifying either with Mary Magdalene.<p>This verse should not be placed in parenthesis, as in our version. It is immediately connected with the verse which precedes, as well as with that which follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used of any aromatic balsam which is distilled from trees and herbs by itself. In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was used of costly ointments used by women. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was the common oil used by men for purposes of health, which might be perfumed. Our Lord clearly draws a distinction between the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-46.htm">Luke 7:46</a>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> has been said to be used for the more superfluous anointings and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;</span> for the sanitary anointing with oil. No trace of such distinction is found in the New Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>). One great distinction in biblical Greek is that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is used of religious anointings, from its association with <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX. is only twice used in this sense, while <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is used times without number (Archbishop Trench, 'New Test. Syn.,' &sect; 38.). The use of the term <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Lord," shows that the story was widely known, and that when the Gospel was written it had passed into a commonplace of Christian experience and illustration. The anointing has not yet been referred to by John, but he is looking back upon the events and anticipates his own subsequent record. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 It is no new thing for those whom Christ loves, to be sick; bodily distempers correct the corruption, and try the graces of God's people. He came not to preserve his people from these afflictions, but to save them from their sins, and from the wrath to come; however, it behoves us to apply to Him in behalf of our friends and relatives when sick and afflicted. Let this reconcile us to the darkest dealings of Providence, that they are all for the glory of God: sickness, loss, disappointment, are so; and if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied. Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. The families are greatly favoured in which love and peace abound; but those are most happy whom Jesus loves, and by whom he is beloved. Alas, that this should seldom be the case with every person, even in small families. God has gracious intentions, even when he seems to delay. When the work of deliverance, temporal or spiritual, public or personal, is delayed, it does but stay for the right time.</body></html>
