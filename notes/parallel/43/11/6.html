But the first reason passes over the fact that their faith had been shown in their message to Him; and the second postulates His presence at Bethany as necessary for the restoration of Lazarus. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-49.htm" title="The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.">John 4:49-50</a>.) A juster view is that which remembers the principle which He had taught at the first miracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>), that the hours of His work were marked out by signs that He alone could read, but that every hour had its work, and every work its hour. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

The fact of death may have determined the hour of their departure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 6 implies an understood <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> in ver. 7, and the whole passage will be as follows: <span class="cmt_word">Now Jesus loved deeply Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus; when therefore he heard that he (Lazarus) was sick, he remained, it is true</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="cmt_word">two days in the place where he was, but then</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">after this</span> (and because he loved) <span class="cmt_word">he saith to his disciples, Let us go again into Judaea</span>. He did not remain because he loved, but, <span class="accented">though</span> he remained, and <span class="accented">because</span> he loved, he said, "Let us," etc. So that we do not see here any intention on his part, by remaining, to test their love (Olshausen), nor to exaggerate the effect of the miracle by raising a dead man from his grave rather than from his death-bed or his bier. It is not difficult to gather from the sequel that when the message reached Jesus Lazarus was dead and buried. We find that when our Lord returned to Bethany four days had elapsed since the death of Lazarus, and the four days must be calculated thus: First one long day's journey from Peraea to Bethany, a distance of eight or nine leagues. If the messenger of the sisters had taken equal time to reach Jesus in Perked, or even a longer period, as time might easily be consumed in the effort to find our Lord in the mountains of Moab; then the two days of his waiting after receiving the message would, with those occupied by the double journey, make up the four that had passed when Jesus reached the grave. Lucke, Neander, Godet, and Westcott think that our Lord remained in Peraea because there was work in which he was engaged and could not relinquish. Meyer, Moulton, and Weiss, that he waited for some especial communication from his Father, for some revelation of moral necessity and heavenly inspiration, like those which dictated all his other movements. B. Weiss: "It was a sacrifice to his calling, of his heart's most ardent desires, that he remained quietly two days in the same place." "We see," says Edersheim, "Christ once more asleep while the disciples are despairing, swamped in the storm! Christ never in haste, because always sure." The silences of Scripture and the waitings of God are often without explanation. The event proves that deep purpose presided over them. The "let us go," etc., implies a lofty courage, a sense of coming crisis. Love conquers fear and peril for himself and his followers. "Judaea" is mentioned rather than Bethany for the same reason. The "again" points forcibly back to the last visit, when he told both friends and foes that the good Shepherd would snatch his sheep from the jaws of death, even though he lay down his own life in the doing of it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 It is no new thing for those whom Christ loves, to be sick; bodily distempers correct the corruption, and try the graces of God's people. He came not to preserve his people from these afflictions, but to save them from their sins, and from the wrath to come; however, it behoves us to apply to Him in behalf of our friends and relatives when sick and afflicted. Let this reconcile us to the darkest dealings of Providence, that they are all for the glory of God: sickness, loss, disappointment, are so; and if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied. Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. The families are greatly favoured in which love and peace abound; but those are most happy whom Jesus loves, and by whom he is beloved. Alas, that this should seldom be the case with every person, even in small families. God has gracious intentions, even when he seems to delay. When the work of deliverance, temporal or spiritual, public or personal, is delayed, it does but stay for the right time.</body></html>
