In the second clause the moral truth is expressed with a prominence which excludes the other.<p><span class= "bld">Because there is no light in him.</span>--The light is now not that "of this world," but that which is within man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</span> He shuts himself off from the light of God-given opportunity, and carries no lamp in his soul. There is no necessity to suppose, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>, that the day was drawing to a close, or that in this place a natural day was dawning; but there is some probability from this phraseology that John adopted the Babylonian rather than the Roman method of computing the hours of the day. This has decided bearing on several important questions (notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-39.htm">John 1:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6, 52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a>). The "twelve hours" shows, at all events, that the Jews at this time generally reckoned from sunrise to sunset. It must be remembered that the day differed considerably in length at different parts of the year, from fourteen hours to nine; but perhaps the emphatic use of the expression derives special interest from the fact that the equinox was approaching. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:7-10 Christ never brings his people into any danger but he goes with them in it. We are apt to think ourselves zealous for the Lord, when really we are only zealous for our wealth, credit, ease, and safety; we have therefore need to try our principles. But our day shall be lengthened out, till our work is done, and our testimony finished. A man has comfort and satisfaction while in the way of his duty, as set forth by the word of God, and determined by the providence of God. Christ, wherever he went, walked in the day; and so shall we, if we follow his steps. If a man walks in the way of his heart, and according to the course of this world, if he consults his own carnal reasonings more than the will and glory of God, he falls into temptations and snares. He stumbles, because there is no light in him; for light in us is to our moral actions, that which light about us to our natural actions.</body></html>
