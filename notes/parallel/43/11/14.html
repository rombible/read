Jesus spake at length (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>) without metaphor (cf. ver. 11, note). <span class="cmt_word">Lazarus died</span>; died, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when he told them two days ago that this sickness would not have death as its end - died in the sense in which they ordinarily used the word. When Jesus described the condition of Lazarus in figurative language, he made use of a metaphor which would have peculiar application in his ease. The grace of Christ will turn the death of his beloved throughout all time into restful sleep. Lazarus was part of the method by which this transformation would be effected. The Christian idea soon found far richer expression than classical poetry or rabbinism could supply (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-52.htm">Matthew 27:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:11-16 Since we are sure to rise again at the last, why should not the believing hope of that resurrection to eternal life, make it as easy for us to put off the body and die, as it is to put off our clothes and go to sleep? A true Christian, when he dies, does but sleep; he rests from the labours of the past day. Nay, herein death is better than sleep, that sleep is only a short rest, but death is the end of earthly cares and toils. The disciples thought that it was now needless for Christ to go to Lazarus, and expose himself and them. Thus we often hope that the good work we are called to do, will be done by some other hand, if there be peril in the doing of it. But when Christ raised Lazarus from the dead, many were brought to believe on him; and there was much done to make perfect the faith of those that believed. Let us go to him; death cannot separate from the love of Christ, nor put us out of the reach of his call. Like Thomas, in difficult times Christians should encourage one another. The dying of the Lord Jesus should make us willing to die whenever God calls us.</body></html>
