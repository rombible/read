The words have a special reference to the interval between His death and the day of Pentecost, which would be for the disciples a time of darkness and danger, when they would have special need of the Father's care.<p><span class= "bld">Holy Father.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:">John 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24-25</a>. There is a special fitness in the word "Holy" here, as in opposition to the world. The disciples were left in the world, but they were not of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-14.htm" title="I have given them your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.">John 17:14</a>). These were spiritually God's children, separated from the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6</a>), and He commits them to the Holy Father, that He may keep them from the evil of the world.<p><span class= "bld">Keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me.</span>--The reading is slightly doubtful, but if we take what would certainly seem to be the true text, the rendering should be, <span class= "ital">Keep them in Thy name which Thou hast given Me.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>.) The Authorised version renders the same words by "through Thy name" in this verse, and by "in Thy name" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>. The thought appears to be that the revelation of the nature of God by Christ to the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6</a>), was that which He Himself received from the Father. "I have not spoken of Myself, but the Father which sent Me, He gave Me a commandment what I should say and what I should speak." (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-49.htm" title="For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.">John 12:49</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That they may be one, as we are.</span>--This clause depends upon the words, "Keep them in Thy name." They had so far realised the revelation of God that they had known Christ's whole life to be the utterance of God to their spirits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6-8</a>). He prays that they may be kept in this knowledge in order that they may so know the Father through Him, as to become themselves one with the Father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I am no more</span> (no longer) <span class="cmt_word">in the world</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>). The earthly ministry is over; for a while he must leave them in the pitiless storm, bereft of his care and counsel, exposed to infinite peril and temptation. Headless, scattered, tempted to believe that all he had said to them was one huge delusion. <span class="cmt_word">And these are in the world</span>, without me, without visible sight of the mirror in which thy glory has been reflected, <span class="cmt_word">and I come</span> - I return - <span class="cmt_word">to thee</span>. These are the conditions on their part and on mine, which justify this prayer for them; and my prayer is, <span class="cmt_word">Holy Father, keep</span> - or, <span class="accented">guard - <span class="cmt_word"></span>them</span>. This grand title stands here in solitary grandeur (though let Ver. 25, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>, be noticed, and the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a> speaks of "the Holy and True," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a> of "the Holy One"). The very holiness of the Father is appealed to as the surest basis of the petition. They have already been taught to pray, "Hallowed [made holy] be thy Name." The eternal holiness and righteousness of God is involved in the saving and sanctification of the believer in Jesus. "<span class="accented">Keep</span> them, holy Father" (says our Lord), <span class="cmt_word">in and by thy Name, those whom thou hast given me.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is the reading of the T.R., on the very feeble authority from the codices, simply D2, 69, and some versions. It is also thus quoted by Epiphanius twice; but the reading of all the best uncial manuscripts, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, L, Y, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x394;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3a0;</span>, etc., numerous versions and quotations, is <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. Some very unimportant manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span>, which Godet prefers as practically equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x7b;&#x3c2;</span>, regarded as a unity, "that which," and as calculated to explain the <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span> of the uncials, and the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;</span>. Lachmann, Tischendorf (8th edit.), Tregelles, Meyer, Westcott and Herr, and R.T. all read <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span>, which is thrown by attraction to <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> into the dative, and requires the translation, <span class="cmt_word">Keep them</span> (<span class="accented">in</span> or <span class="accented">by</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in the power of thy Name which thou hast given me</span>. And since <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span> is a resolution of the attraction, it is quite as likely that <span class="accented">it</span> is a correction of <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span> as that the reverse process should have taken place. The expression is very peculiar, but not inexplicable. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a> is the best illustration of the clause. It reads, according to the true text, "<span class="accented">He</span> hath bestowed on him the Name (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) which is above every name," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the eternal Name, the incommunicable Name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>) of Jehovah. Meyer objects to this that the Father's Name was simply given him as an ambassador or for purposes of revelation and manifestation. This may be a partial limitation of the thought. He has already said, "<span class="accented">I</span> have manifested thy Name, thy fatherhood to the men," etc. And now he adds, "<span class="accented">Keep</span> them in the power and grace of this glorious Name, of which my Person and message have been the full expression." <span class="cmt_word">That they may be one</span>, united, formed into a unity of being, <span class="cmt_word">even as we are</span>, not losing their personality, but blending and interchanging their interests and their affections after the Divine pattern of the Father and Son. The relations between Christians, which constitute the essential unity of their corporate being, are of the same kind as those which pertain to Christ and God, and prevail between them, therefore lying far behind the shifting phases of organization and human order, in the essence and substance of spiritual life. Some writers have found in this analogy between the union of believers and the hypostatic union of the Persons of the Godhead, either a species of tritheism in the Godhead, or a minimizing of the entire conception to what is called moral union between the Father-God and his Son Jesus Christ. But the effect of the utterance is rather to lift the idea of the unity of the body of Christ to a superlative height, and to interpret still further the nature of its oneness with the Father and Son (see Ver. 23). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:11-16 Christ does not pray that they might be rich and great in the world, but that they might be kept from sin, strengthened for their duty, and brought safe to heaven. The prosperity of the soul is the best prosperity. He pleaded with his holy Father, that he would keep them by his power and for his glory, that they might be united in affection and labours, even according to the union of the Father and the Son. He did not pray that his disciples should be removed out of the world, that they might escape the rage of men, for they had a great work to do for the glory of God, and the benefit of mankind. But he prayed that the Father would keep them from the evil, from being corrupted by the world, the remains of sin in their hearts, and from the power and craft of Satan. So that they might pass through the world as through an enemy's country, as he had done. They are not left here to pursue the same objects as the men around them, but to glorify God, and to serve their generation. The Spirit of God in true Christians is opposed to the spirit of the world.</body></html>
