The thought of the work to which the Apostles are to be consecrated and sent leads on to the wider thought of the Church which shall believe through their word, and the prayer is enlarged to include them.<p><span class= "bld">But for them also which shall believe on me through their word.</span>--All the best MSS. read, "but for them also which believe;" but the sense is not affected by the change. As we have again and again found in these chapters, the future of the Church is so immediately in our Lord's thoughts that it is spoken of as actually present. "Their word" is their witness concerning Him through which men should believe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-27.htm" title="And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.">John 15:27</a>). He had manifested the nature of God to them; and they who had received His word and witnessed His work would become, by the indwelling of the Spirit in them, the means of extending this revelation of God to others. They would do this by means of the word which, in His name, they would preach. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-14.htm" title="How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?">Romans 10:14</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-26.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Prayer for the Church Catholic in all time</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither do I pray</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for</span> - concerning <span class="cmt_word">these alone, but also for those who believe</span> <span class="cmt_word">on me through their word</span>. The Lord summons the future into the present. He speaks of having once for all sent them, and he sees rising before his eye the multitudes in all ages who would believe their testimony as if already doing so. The universal Church rejoices in the fullness of his love and the greatness of his wish concerning the individuals who believe. The prayer is an eternal intercession. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:20-23 Our Lord especially prayed, that all believers might be as one body under one head, animated by one soul, by their union with Christ and the Father in him, through the Holy Spirit dwelling in them. The more they dispute about lesser things, the more they throw doubts upon Christianity. Let us endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, praying that all believers may be more and more united in one mind and one judgment. Thus shall we convince the world of the truth and excellence of our religion, and find more sweet communion with God and his saints.</body></html>
