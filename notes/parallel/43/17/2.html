The word for "to them" is masculine and plural, and signifies the individual reception on the part of those to whom eternal life is given. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39-40</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as thou gavest him authority</span> - an indefeasible claim of influence and intimate organic relations with humanity - <span class="cmt_word">over all flesh</span>. [This phrase answers to (<span class="accented">col bosor</span>) the Old Testament term for the whole of humanity, the entire race, and is one adopted by New Testament writers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-6.htm">Luke 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-29.htm">1 Corinthians 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>).] This authority was implied in his incarnation and sacrifice, and in the recapitulation of all things in him. St. Paul says, "Because he tasted death for every man, God has highly exalted him, and given him <span class="accented">the Name</span> that is above every name," etc. These opening words reveal the universality and world-wide aspects of the mission and authority and saving power of the Son of God. He holds the keys of the kingdom and city of God. The government is upon his shoulder. Through him all the nations on earth are to be blessed. But the dependence of "all flesh" upon a Divine <span class="accented">gift</span> of eternal life through him is no less conspicuous; hence the hopelessness of human nature as it is and apart from grace. The end of this glorification of the Son in the Father is <span class="cmt_word">that</span>, in the exercise of this authority, <span class="cmt_word">he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.</span> The construction is unusual, and literally rendered would be, <span class="accented">that with reference to the whole of that which thou hast given him</span>, <span class="accented">to them he should give eternal life</span>. The clause, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, may be a nominative or accusative absolute, which, by the defining <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> subsequently resolved into individual elements. The redeemed humanity of all time has been given to the incarnate Son, and is undoubtedly different from the (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>) "all flesh" of the previous clause, but it is further explained to mean the individual men and women who receive from him eternal life. The bestowment of eternal life on those thus given to him is the method in which he will glorify the Father (see notes on John 6:37, where the Father is said to draw men to himself by means of the unveiling of his own true character in the Son, and where this <span class="accented">drawing</span> is seen to be another way of describing the Father's <span class="accented">gift</span> to the Son). Those who are given to Christ are those who are drawn by the Father's grace to see his perfect self-revelation in the face of Jesus Christ, of whom Jesus says, "I will by no means cast them out" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>), and concerning whom he avers, "No one cometh unto the Father but by me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">life</span> eternal, is frequently described as his gift. From the first the evangelist has regarded <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span> as the inherent and inalienable prerogative of the "Logos," and the source of all the "light" which has lighted men. This "life," which is "light," came into the world in his birth, and became the head of a new humanity. It is clearly more than, and profoundly different from, the principle of unending existence. Life is more than perpetuity of being, and eternity is not endlessness, nor is "eternal life" a mere prolongation of duration; it refers rather to state and quality than to one condition of that state; it is the negation of time rather than indefinite or infinite prolongation of time. That which Christ gives to those who believe in him, receive him, is the life of God himself. It is strongly urged by many that this eternal life is a present realizable possession, that he that hath the Son hath life, and that we are to disregard the future in the conscious enjoyment of this blessedness; but we must not forget that our Lord obviously refers the life eternal to the future in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-30.htm">Mark 10:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>. Nor are these statements, as some have said, incompatible with the representations of this Gospel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40, 54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>). The aionian blessedness may have a partial realization here and now, but not fill our vision is less clouded and our perils are less severe shall we fully apprehend it. Nor is this inconsistent with Ver. 3. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-5 Our Lord prayed as a man, and as the Mediator of his people; yet he spoke with majesty and authority, as one with and equal to the Father. Eternal life could not be given to believers, unless Christ, their Surety, both glorified the Father, and was glorified of him. This is the sinner's way to eternal life, and when this knowledge shall be made perfect, holiness and happiness will be fully enjoyed. The holiness and happiness of the redeemed, are especially that glory of Christ, and of his Father, which was the joy set before him, for which he endured the cross and despised the shame; this glory was the end of the sorrow of his soul, and in obtaining it he was fully satisfied. Thus we are taught that our glorifying God is needed as an evidence of our interest in Christ, through whom eternal life is God's free gift.</body></html>
