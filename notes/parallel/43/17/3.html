The thought of the following verse is that He has accomplished this work. In this verse He shows in what its accomplishment consists--<span class= "ital">viz.,</span> in revealing to men the only true God through Jesus Christ.<p><span class= "bld">That they might know thee the only true God.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">That they might recognise Thee as the only true God.</span> (Comp.

Only in the Word made flesh can we hear the voice of mercy, forgiveness, love, fatherhood; which comes to men as the breath of life, so that they become living souls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The life eternal</span>, of which Jesus has just spoken, <span class="cmt_word">is this</span> (cf. for construction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a>), <span class="cmt_word">that</span> <span class="cmt_word">they might know</span> - should come to know - <span class="cmt_word">thee, the only veritable God</span>. All ideas of God which deviate from or fall short of "the Father" revealed to us by Christ, are not the veritable God, and the knowledge of them is not life eternal. The Father is here set forth as the <span class="accented">fens Deitatis</span>. This does not exclude "the Son," but is inconceivable without him. The Fatherhood expresses an eternal relation. The one element involves the ether as integral to itself: "I am in the Father, and the Father in me." There is a knowledge of the Father possible even now. "Henceforth, he has said, ye have seen him, and known him;" yet not till the veil is lifted, and we see face to face, shall we know as we are known (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>), shall we see him as he is. <span class="cmt_word">And him whom thou didst send, Jesus the Christ</span> (not <span class="accented">Jesus to be</span>, or as <span class="accented">Christ</span>, but rather "Jesus the Christ," as the expansion and explanation of the more indefinite term, "him whom thou didst scud"). Why does our Lord add to this expression one that at first sight seems so incompatible with the idea of this prayer? It has led so careful and reverential a commentator as Westcott to remove the difficulty by supposing that the whole verse is a gloss of the evangelist, expressing the sense of what our Lord may have uttered at greater length. We are loath to admit this method of exegesis, especially as the sole reasons for it are the supposed strangeness of our Lord's here using a phrase so unaccustomed, and thus giving himself not only his Personal Name, but his own official title. It is unusual. The phrase does undoubtedly belong to a later period for its current and constant use. Yet it must not be forgotten <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that this is a unique moment in his career, and unique expressions may be anticipated; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it was calculated to strengthen his disciples, to allow them to hear once from his own lips the solemn claim to Messiahship (see Godet); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that John himself at once adopted it as his own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-22.htm">1 John 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1, 2, 5</a>); moreover, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a> Jesus Christ is, himself lifted up into the region of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the apostle adds, "This is the true God, and eternal life" (Hengstenberg). It is from these very words that some critics imagine that the evangelist, rather than the Lord himself, framed the clause; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> yet it is quite as rational to suppose that the words uttered by Jesus dwelt like a strain of sacred music in the memory of the apostle. Moreover, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the knowledge of the only true God is really conditioned by the knowledge of him who was indeed the great Revelation, Organ, and Effluence of the Father's glory. The fullness of this knowledge is the end of all Christian striving. Paul said, "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus... and that I <span class="accented">may</span> know him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). How much is there yet to know! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> Finally, as our Lord is rising more and more into the glory of an utter self-abandonment, and into the glory which he had with the Father from eternity, the human nature which he still inhabits becomes almost an appendage of his Divine Personality, and he might with awful significance, when referring to the object of human faith and knowledge, say, "Him whom thou hast sent - Jesus the Christ." Moreover, on any hypothesis of the composition or framing of an intercessory prayer for the Logos Christos to utter, there is an equal difficulty in the insertion into such prayer by St. John of this reference to himself as the Christ. The knowledge of the Father as the only true God, in opposition to the heathen traditions and philosophical speculations of the world, coupled with a corresponding knowledge of the only adequate expression of the Father's heart and nature, sent forth from him, as One promised, consecrated, and empowered to represent him, is <span class="accented">life - ere</span> <span class="accented">half life</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-5 Our Lord prayed as a man, and as the Mediator of his people; yet he spoke with majesty and authority, as one with and equal to the Father. Eternal life could not be given to believers, unless Christ, their Surety, both glorified the Father, and was glorified of him. This is the sinner's way to eternal life, and when this knowledge shall be made perfect, holiness and happiness will be fully enjoyed. The holiness and happiness of the redeemed, are especially that glory of Christ, and of his Father, which was the joy set before him, for which he endured the cross and despised the shame; this glory was the end of the sorrow of his soul, and in obtaining it he was fully satisfied. Thus we are taught that our glorifying God is needed as an evidence of our interest in Christ, through whom eternal life is God's free gift.</body></html>
