He expresses in this grand thought of the unity of the whole Church the fulness of the purpose of His prayer.<p><span class= "bld">As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.</span>--The insertion of "art," which, as the italics show, is not in the original text, weakens the sense. It is better, therefore, to omit it. The word "one," in the second clause, is of doubtful authority, and has the appearance of a gloss. The probable reading, therefore, is, <span class= "ital">That they all may be one; as Thou, Father, in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be in Us;</span> and the meaning is that the union of the Church may be of the same essential nature as that between the Father and the Son; yea, that the union of the Church may result from the union of individual members with the Father through the Son. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/15-4.htm" title="Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me.">John 15:4-10</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) The Father in the Son and the Son in the Father; both Father and Son taking up their abode in the believer, and the believer, therefore, in the Father and the Son. This is the ideal of the unity of the Church of Christ; and if this union with God is realised by each individual, it necessarily follows that all the individuals will be one with each other. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">That the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</span>--The result of the union of believers with God, and therefore with each other, will be that the world will see in it a proof of the divine origin of Christianity, and will believe that the Father sent the Son into the world. As this will be the result, it is thought of as the purpose of the prayer for the whole body of believers. Instances of this result crowd involuntarily upon the mind. The brotherhood of Christians has ever been the witness to their common Fatherhood in God. The divisions of Christendom have ever been the weakness of the Church and the proof to the world that, in that they are divided, they cannot be of God. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-35.htm" title="By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.">John 13:35</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they all may be one</span>. My prayer is that the many may become one, form one living glorious unity; - every part of which spiritual organism, while living a separate and differentiated life, is yet a part of a whole. In the natural sphere, as the parts of a whole organism are mere and more developed, and increasingly resemble individualities in their separation, they are in the same proportion dependent on the whole for the life that is in them. Even in a highly organized community, as the separate individuals have more and more personal consciousness of <span class="accented">special</span> function, they become the more dependent on the whole, and in one sense lost in the unity to which they belong. The branches in the vine form together one vine; the members of a body, being many, are one body and members of one another. It is open to discussion whether the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> clause, which here follows, characterizes the above statement, as Meyer and many others urge, or whether, with Godet, the sentence, "That they all may be one," should not be taken as a general statement, to be followed by the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> clause, which characterizes the following words. The first method is a more rational interpretation, nor does the sentence drag. <span class="cmt_word">According as thou, Father</span>, (art) <span class="cmt_word">in me, and I</span> (am) <span class="cmt_word">in thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the relation between the Father and Son, the manner in which the Father lives in the Son, as in his organ or instrument of manifestation and object of supreme affection, and as the Son is in the Father, abiding ever in the light of his glory, in the power of his Name, and as these two are thus One in being, so, or similarly, the believers are to live in and for each other, becoming a unity, just as the Father and Son are unity. <span class="cmt_word">In order that they themselves also may be</span> [one] <span class="cmt_word">in us</span>. This <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> does not offer a parallel sentence in apposition with the former, nor is the "that" to be inverted, with Godet, who translates, "that according as thou.., they also may be one in us;" but it is the climax of the whole unifying process, after the likeness of the union between the Father and the Son, viz. that they themselves may be included in this unity. Though they are thus to be lost in God, yet they do not lose their own individuality. Nay, in proportion to their organic relation to the fullness of the Godhead and the completeness of their own spiritual fellowship with one another, will this personal consciousness of theirs become more and more pronounced. There is yet a further process contemplated, viz. <span class="cmt_word">in order that the world may believe</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;</span>, as in the next verse; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc3;</span>, in the present subjunctive, rather than the aorist) <span class="cmt_word">that thou didst send me</span>. The spiritual life and unity of the Church will produce an impression on the world which now rejects the Christ and does not appreciate his Divine commission. The union which springs from the blended life of the various and even contradictory elements in the Church will prove the reality of its origin. The world will believe, - this is the final purpose of the intercession concerning the disciples; so though above he did not pray for the world as the then immediate object of his intercession, the poor world is in his heart, and the saving of the world the end of his incarnation. If the union between the Father and the Son is the sublime type of the union between those who shall believe, it is not the union of a great society in accordance with certain invincible rules of affiliation and government. The union between the Father and Son is <span class="accented">not</span> a visible manifestation, but a spiritual inference. The common indwelling in the Father and Son, the identity of the spiritual emotion and purpose in all who have one Lord, one faith, one baptism, will convince the world by producing a similar inference. Alford: "This unity is not mere outward uniformity, nor can such uniformity produce it. At the same time, its effects are to be real and visible, such that the world may see them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:20-23 Our Lord especially prayed, that all believers might be as one body under one head, animated by one soul, by their union with Christ and the Father in him, through the Holy Spirit dwelling in them. The more they dispute about lesser things, the more they throw doubts upon Christianity. Let us endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, praying that all believers may be more and more united in one mind and one judgment. Thus shall we convince the world of the truth and excellence of our religion, and find more sweet communion with God and his saints.</body></html>
