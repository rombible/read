They had through Christ received the Father's word, which was truth, and had passed into a new region of life, separate from the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-14.htm" title="I have given them your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.">John 17:14-16</a>). He has prayed that the Father would preserve them in this, and now He prays further that the Father would in this new region of life set them apart for the work to which He had sent them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-18.htm" title="As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.">John 17:18</a>).<p>The idea at the root of the word rendered "sanctify," is not holiness, but separation. It is opposed not to what is impure, but to what is common, and is constantly used in the Greek of the Old Testament for the consecration of persons and things to the service of God. Hence our Lord can use it of Himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>, and in this context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-19.htm" title="And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.">John 17:19</a>; these are the only places where it occurs in St. John's writings). He was Himself "set apart and sent into the world." He has to send them into the world in the same way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-18.htm" title="As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.">John 17:18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>), and prays that they may be in the same way consecrated for their work.<p><span class= "bld">Thy word is truth.</span>--There is a strong emphasis in the pronoun "<span class= "ital">Thy</span> word is truth." This word they had kept (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6-8</a>). It had become the region of their life. They are to be the channels through which it is to pass to others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20</a>). They are already in the higher sphere of truth, in which their entire consecration is to take place, when the gifts of the Holy Spirit shall descend upon them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sanctify them</span>; consecrate them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>, of the sanctification of the Son by the Father to the work of effecting human redemption), separate them from the evil of the world, as for holy purposes. Devote them to the glorious cause. Let them be sacrifices on the altar. The <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to sanctify, is not synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to purify; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> not a contradiction of the defiled so much as of the purely natural, and involves the higher ends of grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1, 36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-13.htm">Exodus 40:13</a>). The sanctification of the Old Testament is a ritual process effected by ceremonial observance; the sanctification of the New Testament is a spiritual process passing over heart and conscience and will, and is the work of the Divine Spirit. Meyer, Westcott, and others translate the next clause, <span class="cmt_word">in the truth</span>, as the atmosphere in which the disciples dwell; but a large number of commentators, with Godet, take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> as equivalent to" by the aid of," with the instrumentality of, "the truth:" consecrate them, by revealing to them the reality, making known to them the truth. If they see the truth they will be discharged from the illusions of the world, the flesh, and the devil. (Luther takes <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> adverbially, and as equivalent to "<span class="accented">verily</span> and indeed; but this cannot well be, seeing the article is present, and taking account of the subsequent definition of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, it becomes improbable.) But what is "<span class="accented">truth"</span><span class="accented">?</span> what is the full expression of reality? how are we to know where to find it? <span class="cmt_word">Thy Logos</span> (thy Word), the utterance of thy thought, <span class="cmt_word">is truth</span>. If we can ever cognize what is the Divine thought about anything, we shall reach the absolute truth. What God troweth is truth per <span class="accented">se</span>. The Logos of God, the full, God-chosen utterance of the reality of truth, is the nearest approach to truth that we possess. This revelation of God is the closest correspondence with the reality. God sanctifies his children, consecrates them to the service of his kingdom by revealing the truth, by making known the otherwise transcendental facts of his kingdom. A long controversy has prevailed in the Church as to whether the Spirit's gracious operations are or are not limited by the operation of truth on the mind. Numerous assurances of the New Testament seem thus to limit the grace of God, or to measure it by the ordinary effect produced on the understanding by Divine truth; e.g. "Of his own will begat he us by the Word of truth;" the parable of the sower, and other Scriptures. But seeing that the regeneration, the conference of new and supernatural life, is set forth by images of resurrection and new creation, and as a purification of taste, bias, and desire, the gift of a new heart and right spirit, the voice of a heavenly sonship crying within us, "Abba, Father," and seeing that the ministration of the Spirit is variously directed and operative, and that there is shadowed forth an immediate work on the heart," back of consciousness" itself, and that the witness of the Spirit and the teaching and indwelling of the Holy Ghost are continually referred to, - we are loath to accept the dogma. The Spirit of God is not limited to the normal operations of the Word. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:17-19 Christ next prayed for the disciples, that they might not only be kept from evil, but made good. It is the prayer of Jesus for all that are his, that they may be made holy. Even disciples must pray for sanctifying grace. The means of giving this grace is, through thy truth, thy word is truth. Sanctify them, set them apart for thyself and thy service. Own them in the office; let thy hand go with them. Jesus entirely devoted himself to his undertaking, and all the parts of it, especially the offering up himself without spot unto God, by the eternal Spirit. The real holiness of all true Christians is the fruit of Christ's death, by which the gift of the Holy Ghost was purchased; he gave himself for his church, to sanctify it. If our views have not this effect on us, they are not Divine truth, or we do not receive them by a living and a working faith, but as mere notions.</body></html>
