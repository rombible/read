The thought is, "For they are Thine (and all My things are Thine, and Thy things are Mine), and I am glorified in them." The fact that Christ is glorified in them forms, then, a second reason for His special prayer for them. The tense is perfect. Its accomplishment is already in part realised (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6-8</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-8.htm" title="Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.">John 15:8</a>), and is more fully to be realised in that future of the Spirit's work which all through this chapter is regarded as present. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-14.htm" title="He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it to you.">John 16:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all things that are mine are thine</span>; whether they be these souls, or these powers that I wield, or these words that I utter, or these works that I do, - all <span class="accented">are thine</span>. This statement is in perfect harmony with all his teaching, and is not incompatible with the reverential sentiment that any servant of God might utter; but he adds words to show that the union between him and the Father is much closer than this, and quite unique. <span class="cmt_word">And thine are mine</span>. Luther observed, "No creature could say this." Perhaps he went too far, because we are taught to believe that "<span class="accented">all</span> things are ours," etc., and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> covers much (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). In the full confidence of filial relation we can believe it true that the heavenly Father <span class="accented">says to</span> every one of his veritable children, "<span class="accented">All</span> that I have is thine." Here the words must not be drawn out of their connection; it is human souls who are of God, and are therefore Christ's. The dogmatic lesson is that every one who has heard and learned of the Father does come to him. Such an assurance gives a sublime hope to the world, <span class="cmt_word">and I</span> (<span class="accented">have been and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>am glorified in them</span>. Once more the Divine Savior rejoices in the victory he has won in securing the faith of the disciples. How much he loved and trusted them! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:6-10. Christ prays for those that are his. Thou gavest them me, as sheep to the shepherd, to be kept; as a patient to the physician, to be cured; as children to a tutor, to be taught: thus he will deliver up his charge. It is a great satisfaction to us, in our reliance upon Christ, that he, all he is and has, and all he said and did, all he is doing and will do, are of God. Christ offered this prayer for his people alone as believers; not for the world at large. Yet no one who desires to come to the Father, and is conscious that he is unworthy to come in his own name, need be discouraged by the Saviour's declaration, for he is both able and willing to save to the uttermost, all that come unto God by him. Earnest convictions and desires, are hopeful tokens of a work already wrought in a man; they begin to evidence that he has been chosen unto salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. They are thine; wilt thou not provide for thine own? Wilt thou not secure them? Observe the foundation on which this plea is grounded, All mine are thine, and thine are mine. This speaks the Father and Son to be one. All mine are thine. The Son owns none for his, that are not devoted to the service of the Father.</body></html>
