Here, as all through this Intercessory Prayer, the future which immediately grows out of the present is regarded as present; the fulness of the glory which awaits Him at His Father's right hand is thought of as already given to Him; and the believers who have become, and will become, one with Him, to whom He has given eternal life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2</a>), are thought of as sharers in it. It is the thought which is expanded by St. Paul when he speaks of the children being "heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if we suffer with Him to the end that we may be also glorified with Him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>); and by St. John when he speaks of <span class= "ital">"</span>children of God being like Him because we shall see Him as He is" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.">1John 3:1-2</a>). In the original the pronoun "<span class= "ital">I</span>" is emphatically expressed. "The glory which Thou hast given Me," our Lord's words seem to mean, "I have on My part given to them. I have fulfilled the work which Thou hast given Me to do. I have made and declared an atonement between man and God. My work is done. I pray that Thou wouldst fulfil Thine own."<p><span class= "bld">That they may be one, even as we are one.</span>--This is here expressed, in addition to the thought of the last verse, as the purpose for which He has given to them the glory which the Father has given Him. It is future in the union of the glory of heaven; it is present in the realisation of heaven now in those who have the one common hope of their calling.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - Our Lord now proceeds to record how he has already contributed to produce this result. <span class="cmt_word">I also</span> - very emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">have given to them</span> - that is, to my disciples - <span class="cmt_word">the glory which thou gavest me</span>. Numerous interpretations of this "glory" have been suggested, as <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, the glory into which he is about to enter in his glorified body; but the emphatic perfect <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, in connection with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, viz.: "I have given and am now and still giving," renders this improbable. Meyer, who does not accept Baumgarten-Crusius's view that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> here means "to destine," yet comes very much to the same thought, and regards it as the heavenly glory of which he had eternal experience, and would ultimately share with his people. But the view variously set forth by Oldhausen, Hengstenberg, Maldonatus, Bengel, Tholuck, Moulton, and Godet appears to be in full harmony with the context, viz. the glory of the supernatural life of Divine Sonship and self-sacrificing love as of the very essence of God. This glory that he should taste death for every man, this glory of nature and character as the incarnate Head of a new humanity, I have given to them, <span class="cmt_word">in order that they may be one</span>, living in and for each other, <span class="cmt_word">even as we are one.</span> The contrast between his own relation to the Father and theirs is most wonderfully maintained. The union between the Father and Son is once more made the type, in his own unique consciousness, of the union among men who have received as his gift the eternal life and glory of a supernatural love. This is more evident from what follows. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:20-23 Our Lord especially prayed, that all believers might be as one body under one head, animated by one soul, by their union with Christ and the Father in him, through the Holy Spirit dwelling in them. The more they dispute about lesser things, the more they throw doubts upon Christianity. Let us endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, praying that all believers may be more and more united in one mind and one judgment. Thus shall we convince the world of the truth and excellence of our religion, and find more sweet communion with God and his saints.</body></html>
