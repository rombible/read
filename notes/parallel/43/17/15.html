But there is for them a work in the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-18.htm" title="As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.">John 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>). He has finished the work His Father gave Him to do; He has glorified the Father on the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-4.htm" title="I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.">John 17:4</a>). There is a work for them to glorify Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>), and He prays not that they should be taken out of the world before their work is done. The Christian ideal is not freedom from work, but strength to do it; not freedom from temptation, but power to overcome it; not freedom from suffering, but joy in an abiding sense of the Father's love; not absence from the world, but grace to make the world better for our presence; not holy lives driven from the world, and living apart from it, but holy lives spent in the world and leavening it.<p><span class= "bld">But that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.">Matthew 6:13</a>. The usage of St. John is, beyond question, in favour of the masculine. The only other passages where he uses the word in the singular are <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.">1John 2:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.">1John 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1John 5:18-19</a>. We have to bear in mind also that the present passage occurs in the second "Lord's Prayer," and that His prayer for them may with probability be interpreted in the same sense as the words in which He taught them to pray. On the whole, therefore, it seems likely, but yet is by no means certain, that we ought to read here, "that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The prayer of Jesus based on this. <span class="cmt_word">I pray</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;</span>; see Ver. 9; the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> here defines the contents of the prayer) <span class="cmt_word">not that thou shouldest take them away</span> - lift them up and out - <span class="cmt_word">out of the world</span>, as thou art taking me by death. This natural desire on the part of some of them is not in harmony with the highest interests of the kingdom. Those interests it would henceforth be their high function to subserve. There is much testimony for them to bear, there are many great facts for them completely to grasp, many aspects of truth which they must put into words for the life and salvation of <span class="accented">souls</span>, individuals for them to teach and train, victories for them to win, examples which they must set before the world.

Over against this kingdom the Lord Christ, as the devil's great Rival, rules in the kingdom of grace. Luther, Calvin, Hengstenberg. Godet, Authorized Version, and numerous other commentators, have regarded <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> as neuter, as referring to the great characteristic and all-subduing temper, the far-reaching glamour and the godless disposition of the world. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> includes <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:11-16 Christ does not pray that they might be rich and great in the world, but that they might be kept from sin, strengthened for their duty, and brought safe to heaven. The prosperity of the soul is the best prosperity. He pleaded with his holy Father, that he would keep them by his power and for his glory, that they might be united in affection and labours, even according to the union of the Father and the Son. He did not pray that his disciples should be removed out of the world, that they might escape the rage of men, for they had a great work to do for the glory of God, and the benefit of mankind. But he prayed that the Father would keep them from the evil, from being corrupted by the world, the remains of sin in their hearts, and from the power and craft of Satan. So that they might pass through the world as through an enemy's country, as he had done. They are not left here to pursue the same objects as the men around them, but to glorify God, and to serve their generation. The Spirit of God in true Christians is opposed to the spirit of the world.</body></html>
