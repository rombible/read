The thought is continued from the last verse, "That they may be one even as we are one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one." It is the thought which the words of Christ have uttered again and again, and which we yet feel that no words can utter. The disciples heard the words immediately after they had heard the allegory of the true vine (John 15); and the fullest meaning of separate words and phrases in these chapters is best arrived at by remembering that they were not uttered as separate words and phrases, but that they were spoken as a whole, and should be read as a whole; and that the most unfathomable of them were spoken in prayer from the Son to the Father.<p><span class= "bld">That they may be made perfect in one.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">unto one.</span> The unity is the result of their being made perfect. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm" title="For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.">Hebrews 10:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1John 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.">1John 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1John 4:17-18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And that the world may know that thou hast sent me.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">didst send Me.</span> Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>. "That the world may know" (recognise) here is parallel to "that the world may believe," in the earlier verse. We are to regard it, therefore, as another instance of the repeated expression of the fulness of thought; and this is borne out by the parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-35.htm" title="By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.">John 13:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-31.htm" title="But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.">John 14:31</a>. The thought which has been introduced here of the conviction of the unbelieving world, seems to be opposed to the context. The prayer is that the world, seeing in its midst the power which binds men together in unity, may believe and know that this is of God, who sent Christ into the world, and may accept for themselves the message of love which the "Sent of God" has brought unto them. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I in them, and thou in me</span>. He does not say, "Thou in them, as thou in me," nor "They in thee, and I in thee;" but he includes in the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> of the previous verse, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;</span>, and distinctly regards himself as the mediating link of relation between the Father and the disciples. The <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is that of the Son of God, manifested in Christ's consciousness of the God-man-hood; the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;</span> is the eternal and non-incarnate God. God is in him, as <span class="accented">he</span> is in them. They are in him, as he is in the Father. <span class="cmt_word">That they may be perfected</span>, completely realizing the end of their being and the meaning of the gift of eternal life, fully ripened in their graces until they reach up <span class="cmt_word">into one</span>, into the fullness of the stature of the perfect Man, until they become the one new and immortal body of the living Christ, (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bd;</span> indicates the sublime result so far as they are concerned). Each individual believer reaching the highest perfection of his being, as according to his own capacity and function he fills his place in the one living body of the Lord The end is not here, however, so far as others are concerned; for this unity, when consummated, is to bring about a yet further result on this earth, and <span class="cmt_word">in order that the world may come to know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc3;</span>.) <span class="cmt_word">that thou didst send me, and lovedst them as thou lovedst me.</span> Our Lord has advanced upon the assertion of Ver. 21, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by discriminating between "believing" and "coming to know" by personal experiences, overwhelming conviction, and processes which lead to invincible assent. Faith in its highest form melts into knowledge, full assurance, complete certitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There is superadded to the conviction concerning the Divine mission of the Christ yet another, viz. a conviction of the wonderful love which thou hast shown to them in thus lifting them out of the world into the unity of the spiritual life, into the fellowship of the Son of God. This has twofold bearing. So far as the world is concerned they will see that the love shown to the believers in Christ will be compatible with the same kind of treatment as Christ himself received, and so far as the Divine reality is concerned, it will be seen that they are so closely identified with Christ that the infinite love of God to Christ flows over in its Divine superabundance upon those who are gathered together into him. It is impossible to exclude from these verses the idea of the <span class="accented">visibility</span> of the union and life of the Church, and of the Divine love to it. Nothing is said or hinted, however, about the <span class="accented">nature</span> of that visibility. Christians are not, by reason of their differences, to exclude from this passage the promise that the whole assembly of the Firstborn would make this gracious and convincing impression on the world. They are far enough, in days of mutual recrimination, from realizing the Divine ideal, and should set themselves to remedy the crying evil; but they have no right to import into the words, by reason of their predilection for particular forms of Church organization, an identification of the body of Christ with any specific form. The spiritual union of Christendom in its one faith, hope, and character, is, notwithstanding the divergence of some of its forms of expression, the most stupendous fact in the history of the world. The e<span class="accented">lite</span> of all Churches are drawing more and more into a visible unity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:20-23 Our Lord especially prayed, that all believers might be as one body under one head, animated by one soul, by their union with Christ and the Father in him, through the Holy Spirit dwelling in them. The more they dispute about lesser things, the more they throw doubts upon Christianity. Let us endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, praying that all believers may be more and more united in one mind and one judgment. Thus shall we convince the world of the truth and excellence of our religion, and find more sweet communion with God and his saints.</body></html>
