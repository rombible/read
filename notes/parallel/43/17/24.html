He had before said, "I pray" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-9.htm" title="I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you have given me; for they are yours.">John 17:9</a>, and Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20</a>), but the thought of the union with the Father, expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm" title="I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.">John 17:23</a>, leads to the fuller expression of His confidence that the prayer will be answered.<p>For the words, "with Me where I am," comp.

That we are to think of the future glory of the divine-human nature of Christ, is shown by the addition of the words, "which Thou hast given Me." The pre-incarnate glory of the Son was of His divine nature only, and is not, therefore, spoken of as given to Him, nor could it be given to those who believe in Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-22.htm" title="And the glory which you gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:">John 17:22</a>). That with which the Father has glorified the Son, is "the glory which He had with the Father before the world was" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>), but it is the Son of man who is glorified with it, and therefore it is that human nature is made capable of receiving it.<p><span class= "bld">For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - Now passing from this glorification of his people in the convictions and knowledge of the world, our Lord offers "as a Son to a Father," and therefore with profound naturalness, the prayer of the incarnate Logos to the eternal Father, and therefore an address indubitably supernatural and lifted above all human consciousness. It is a prayer, too, which rises from the high and unique term <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span> (one which he never puts into the lips of his disciples) to a yet higher one, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, as one who speaks with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> which God had given him over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to those whom God had given him. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> means less than "I will," and more than "I desire," and is destitute of that element of "counsel" or deliberation that is involved in <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Very soon after this, when the full force of his human consciousness pressed upon him, he said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>), "Not what (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>) I will, but what thou wiliest." But here he is so conscious of the Father's will concerning others that he cries, <span class="cmt_word">Father, as for them whom</span> - or, as some ancient codices read, <span class="cmt_word">that</span> <span class="cmt_word">which</span> - <span class="cmt_word">thou hast given me</span>, regarded as a mystic unity, as the Bride which he has redeemed, <span class="cmt_word">I will that they also be with me where I am</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> resolves the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;</span> into the elements of which it is composed. This is the first part of the final petition, and it embraces everything. "<span class="accented">With</span> Christ;" "Forever with the Lord;" in his glory and part of it, in the place which he is going to localize and prepare for them, is heaven. The glory which he had already given to his disciples (Ver. 22) falls far short of this fellowship with him where his undimmed radiance shines, is only a preparation for sharing with him in his ultimate triumph over the world and death, and also for sitting down with him on his throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>). In this world fellowship with him in his suffering humanity did not finally reveal the transcendent glory (though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> the apostle says, "We beheld his glory," etc.) of his Person. To realize this he prays, <span class="cmt_word">And that they may also behold the glory which is mine, which thou hast given me</span>. The glory given cannot be the glory of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, according to Meyer, for that is not given, but belongs to him by eternal right; yet Meyer admits that the Father gave the Son to have life in himself; and that even the eternal Sonship itself may be regarded as the eternal bestowment of an infinite love. Seeing that the Lord goes on to give a reason of his <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> founded on an eternal or at least pre-mundane manifestation of a conscious love, surely he is thinking of the exaltation of humanity into the eternal glory, which he distinctly relinquished and veiled in the days of his flesh. That which they had hitherto seen they only partially apprehended, though he had even given it to them (ver. 22), and though they had been drawn out of the world to high places of transfiguration, that they might behold it and learn how it coexisted with and was compatible with a perfect resignation to the will of God in human redemption. Our Lord prays, nay, <span class="accented">wills</span>, that they should hereafter see it in its fullness of grace and beauty, see it when relieved from obstructive hindrances due to the flesh and to the world, see it on the grandest scale, see it as it really <span class="accented">is</span>, see the full capacity and infinite momentum of the glory which he had already bestowed upon them. <span class="cmt_word">For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span> This, say Meyer and Luthardt, is given as a reason of the prayer for his disciples, not as an explanation of the glory which he had with the Father before the world was. It is often said that the exaltation of the Son of man is a reward for his self-humiliation, and the crown of his sacrificial death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>), but these very passages couple that exaltation with the premundane glory of him who was, to begin with, and before his work of redemption, the "Effulgence of the Father's glory," who was "in the form of God," and regarded the being equal with God as no <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;</span> as a thing to be seized, prized, and held in its integrity. And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>, "<span class="accented">He</span> was by reason of his intended passion crowned with glory and honor, in order that he might taste death for every man." So that the glory which he had with the Father before the world was, and therefore before his incarnation, was that very glory of self-devoting and unutterable love into which he would come again with all the trophies of his redemptive work. The new and higher embodiment of his humanity would prove of such a kind that his essential glory would shine through it in undimmed luster. If this be the meaning, we cannot dilute this pregnant saying, one of the most mysterious of all his words, one which leads us up to the highest possible conception of the relations between the Father and the Son. The eternal love of which the Godhead itself is the SOURCE and the OBJECT is that to which we shall be introduced, and which our Lord would have us see and share (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1-3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:24-26 Christ, as one with the Father, claimed on behalf of all that had been given to him, and should in due time believe on him, that they should be brought to heaven; and that there the whole company of the redeemed might behold his glory as their beloved Friend and Brother, and therein find happiness. He had declared and would further declare the name or character of God, by his doctrine and his Spirit, that, being one with him, the love of the Father to him might abide with them also. Thus, being joined to Him by one Spirit, they might be filled with all the fulness of God, and enjoy a blessedness of which we can form no right idea in our present state.</body></html>
