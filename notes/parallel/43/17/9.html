"I who have during my work on earth taught them;" "they who have received the truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-8.htm" title="For I have given to them the words which you gave me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from you, and they have believed that you did send me.">John 17:8</a>). "I who am about to leave the world;" "they who will remain in the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep through your own name those whom you have given me, that they may be one, as we are.">John 17:11</a>). The tense is the strict present, referring to the prayer which He is at this moment uttering, and not to His general practice, which the Authorised version may be taken to express. Against any limitation of the prayer of our Lord, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>, and His own prayer for His enemies, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.">Luke 23:34</a>). Comp. also His command to His disciples to pray for "them which despitefully used them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a>). The present prayer was like that which pious Rabbis were accustomed to offer for their pupils. (Comp. Sch�ttgen's Note here.) It is from its very nature applicable only to disciples. He is leaving them, and commends them to His Father's care.<p><span class= "bld">But for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</span>--This is the special claim on which He commends them to the Father. They were the Father's before they were given to the Son. By that gift they have become the Father's more fully (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6-8</a>). They are the Father's, for all things which are the Son's are the Father's, and all things which are the Father's are the Son's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I</span> - very emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">am praying for them</span> (for this use of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span> see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-23.htm">John 16:23</a>). We must remember that this is perfectly consistent with the fact that, in the day of the spiritual manifestation to the disciples, when both the Father and Son came to them, the disciples would ask the Father for the gifts which his love to them was waiting to supply; and he, Christ himself, would hear them if they asked in his Name; and that then there would be no need that he should pray the Father for them. That time had not yet come, though it was coming. Both statements are also perfectly consistent with his "intercession" for us. <span class="cmt_word">Not concerning</span> - or, <span class="accented">not for - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the world am I praying</span>. Surely this is not an assertion that he would never pray, or that he had not already prayed, for the world. Nay, his entire ministry is the expression of the Father's love to the whole world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). He came as Jehovah's Lamb to take away its sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), he bade his disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>) pray for their enemies, and he cried at the last for a blessing on his murderers. He "came to seek and save the lost," to "<span class="accented">call</span> sinners to repentance," "<span class="accented">not</span> to condemn, but to save the world." Moreover, in this prayer (Ver. 21) he <span class="accented">does</span> pray for those who should ultimately, though they do not now, believe on him through the word of the disciples; therefore it is inconceivable that he should here dogmatically limit the range of his gracious desire. Calvin here observes, "We are commanded to pray for all (l Timothy 2:1)," and quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a> that Christ prayed for his murderers. "<span class="accented">We</span> ought to pray that this man and that man and every man may be saved, and thus include the whole human race, because we cannot distinguish the elect from the reprobate." Calvin implies that Christ is here within the sanctuary, and places before his eyes the secret judgments of the Father. Lampe goes much further. Luther <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">In</span> the same sense in which he prays for the disciples, he does not pray for the world." But the best explanation is that the high-priestly intercession at this supreme moment is concerned with those who were already given to him, and who have come to believe in his Divine Person and commission. He expressly and divinely commends to the Father <span class="cmt_word">those whom thou hast given</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span> - the burden of the thought is contained in the motive he suggests for this commendation, viz. - <span class="cmt_word">because they are thine</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though thou hast given them to me, though they have "come to <span class="accented">me</span>," through thy drawing, they are more than ever "thine." This most fervent yielding to the attraction of Jesus, and utter moral surrender to his control, do not alienate the heart from the Father, but make it more than ever his. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:6-10. Christ prays for those that are his. Thou gavest them me, as sheep to the shepherd, to be kept; as a patient to the physician, to be cured; as children to a tutor, to be taught: thus he will deliver up his charge. It is a great satisfaction to us, in our reliance upon Christ, that he, all he is and has, and all he said and did, all he is doing and will do, are of God. Christ offered this prayer for his people alone as believers; not for the world at large. Yet no one who desires to come to the Father, and is conscious that he is unworthy to come in his own name, need be discouraged by the Saviour's declaration, for he is both able and willing to save to the uttermost, all that come unto God by him. Earnest convictions and desires, are hopeful tokens of a work already wrought in a man; they begin to evidence that he has been chosen unto salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. They are thine; wilt thou not provide for thine own? Wilt thou not secure them? Observe the foundation on which this plea is grounded, All mine are thine, and thine are mine. This speaks the Father and Son to be one. All mine are thine. The Son owns none for his, that are not devoted to the service of the Father.</body></html>
