Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:">John 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep through your own name those whom you have given me, that they may be one, as we are.">John 17:11</a>), but now with the special thought of the Father's righteousness. This thought follows upon the prayer that those whom the Father had given Him may be where He is, and behold the divine glory; and the connection seems to be in the thought that sinful humanity cannot see God and live. The world, indeed, knew not God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-21.htm" title="But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.">John 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm" title="And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.">John 16:3</a>), but the Son knew God, and the disciples had recognised that He had been sent by God, and in their knowledge of Him had passed through a moral' change, by which they were no longer of the world, but were sons of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The prayer is thus over, and once more the great High Priest and Victim declares concerning himself some of the mysteries of his Person and of his relation with his disciples and with the world. <span class="cmt_word">O righteous Father</span> (cf. Vers. 1, 5, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> simply; Ver. 11, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>; Ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> without any characterization). The righteousness of God is a more exalted perfection than his holiness, one that might seem more at variance with the exercise of his paternal compassion; yet this righteousness is conspicuously displayed in the redemptive love which Christ had thus manifested, and the beloved disciple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>) declares that God is faithful and "righteous" in forgiving the repentant sinner. The blending of the idea of righteousness with Fatherhood is the sublime revelation made by the Lord Jesus, and he gathers the two ideas together into an indissoluble unity. Justice and mercy are seen by the whole work of the Son of God to have been the outflow and effulgence of the one all-comprehending and infinite love. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> that here follows has created some difficulty, though some manuscripts emit it (D and Vulgate), probably in consequence of its inappropriateness; but it is received on strong ancient authority. Meyer and Hengstenberg take it thus: <span class="accented">Righteous Father</span> (<span class="accented">yea</span>, <span class="accented">such thou art</span>), <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">yet</span>) <span class="accented">the world knew thee not</span>. But would our Lord have hesitated, as it were, to express this truth, without justifying it against the unbelief of the world? Moulton tries to explain the simple adversative force of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by "both the world learned not to know thee, but I learned to know thee." Godet has expressed the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> more effectively by translating, <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">world</span>, <span class="accented">it is true</span>, <span class="accented">knew thee not</span>, <span class="accented">but I knew thee</span>. The Revised Version has, with the Authorized Version, simply omitted the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>. It is one of the most solemn of the Lord's condemnations of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Apostle Paul said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>), "The world through its wisdom knew not God;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-23</a> he shows that this ignorance was willful and practical and without excuse. The history of the struggling of the world after God has shown how dense the human darkness is. There have been signs that men groped after the idea of a Father who should be blind to their faults and indifferent to their follies, and utter a righteous Lord who has exalted righteousness and hated iniquity; but it was left for Christ to blend these apparently discordant beams into the radiance of a perfect glory. How many illustrations do the sad and shameless perversions of human intelligence supply! <span class="cmt_word">But I knew thee</span>, because of the eternity of that ineffable love wherewith thou hast loved me, and because of the depth of that righteous love which thou hast manifested to the world in sending me upon my mission. <span class="cmt_word">And these knew</span> - came to know by personal intuition - <span class="cmt_word">that thou didst send me</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a>, and Vers. 8, 23) on the mission of redeeming the world. They have learned that I have come with all thy authority and in all thy power; that I have come out from thee; that I entered into the world; that I have glorified thee among men; that my thoughts are thy thoughts, and my "words" (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) are thy (Logos) "Word;" that my works of love are the works of the Father; and that my promises are the manifestation of thy Name to the men whom thou hast given me. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:24-26 Christ, as one with the Father, claimed on behalf of all that had been given to him, and should in due time believe on him, that they should be brought to heaven; and that there the whole company of the redeemed might behold his glory as their beloved Friend and Brother, and therein find happiness. He had declared and would further declare the name or character of God, by his doctrine and his Spirit, that, being one with him, the love of the Father to him might abide with them also. Thus, being joined to Him by one Spirit, they might be filled with all the fulness of God, and enjoy a blessedness of which we can form no right idea in our present state.</body></html>
