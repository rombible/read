Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-31.htm" title="But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.">John 14:31</a>. If the view thus adopted is the correct one, it follows that the prayer of this chapter, as well as the discourses which preceded it, was uttered as they were preparing to leave the chamber after supper. The words "to heaven" ought not to be taken to imply that he looked up to the sky, and must, therefore, have been in the open air. The upward look is naturally expressive of feeling, and irrespective of place. This chapter contains, then, the words uttered by our Lord, with eyes lifted up to heaven, in prayer to the Father. It is often spoken of as the High Priest's Prayer (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-19.htm" title="And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.">John 17:19</a>). He who would understand it must remember that he is in the Holy of Holies, and must approach it with eyes and heart uplifted to the God to whom and by whom it was spoken.<p>Bengel speaks of this chapter as the simplest in word, and profoundest in thought, in the whole Bible. The key to the thought is in the presence of the Spirit, who shall guide into all truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-26.htm" title="At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:">John 16:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Father, the hour is come.</span>--"Father," without any addition, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>.

In the first petition of this prayer the disciples are not identified with Him, and yet He does not by the use of the singular person exclude them. Through Him they and all believers receive the spirit of adoption, and cry, as He cried, "Abba, Father." For the thought of the hour, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm" title="And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.">John 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name.

This is further explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2-4</a><span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-26.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The <span class="accented">high-priestly intercession</span>. .<span class="accented">Audible communion of the Son with the Father</span>. The prayer which now follows reveals, in the loftiest and sublimest form, the Divine humanity of the Son of man, and the fact that, in the consciousness of Jesus as the veritable Christ of God, there was actually blended the union of the Divine and human, and a perfect exercise of the prerogatives of both. The illimitable task which writers of the second century must have set themselves to accomplish, if they had by some unknown process conceived such a stupendous idea without any historical basis to support it, has actually been so effected, that a representation is given which adequately conveys such a synthesis. The author of the Gospel does, however, draw rather upon his memory of that night than upon his philosophical imagination for a passage which surpasses all literature in its setting forth the identity of being and power and love in the twofold personality of the God-Man. We are brought by it to the mercy-seat, into the heaven of heavens, to the very heart of God; and we find there a presentation of the most mysterious and incomprehensible love to the human race, embodied in the Person, enshrined in the words, of the only begotten Son. It need not perplex those who believe that we have the words of Jesus, that this prayer of sublime victory and glorious promise should be followed by the agony and the bloody sweat of Gethsemane, where the glorification of the Son of man passed into the advanced stage of his willing and perfect surrender to the Supreme Will. Hengstenberg finds explanation of John's silence touching that agony in the supplemental character of the Gospel, which does not repeat a description of a scene already familiar to all readers of the synoptic narrative. This may account for the mere form of the record, but does it meet the perplexity that arises as to whether the scene of Gethsemane could possibly follow John's narrative? Is not such a conception incompatible altogether with the cry, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me"? Our answer is a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>, where there is the exact counterpart of the scene in the garden. Nor is a mysterious troubling of the Redeemer's soul elsewhere absent from the Johannine narrative. At the grave of Lazarus, as well as when the Greeks wrung from his lips the cry, "Father, save me from this hour," followed by "Father, glorify thy Name," we have the blending of an utterly indescribable affliction with a triumphant acceptance by him of the Divine purpose of his mission and the will of his Father. Throughout these discourses he is meditating his departure with all its accompanying grief and agony. He describes the way he is about to take as one which would be like the travail-pang of a new humanity; but in his capacity of living in the light of the Father's will, he treats the whole mystery of the cross, the grave, the resurrection, the ascension, as already achieved. Throughout this prayer he regards the work as finished, and the new order of things as already existent. Thus he had prayed for Lazarus and for his restoration from the grave, and he knew then that God heard him; but still he wept, and, groaning within himself, came to the sepulcher. It should also be remembered that (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>) he had expressly said that he was then about to encounter the prince of this world. The perfect humanity of Jesus, on which John continually insists, does entirely justify the rapid changes of mood and the vehemence of the emotions which were in their conflict issuing in sublime courage and perfect peace. The school of Renan, Strauss, and others, following the lead of Bret-schneider, see insuperable difficulties, because they have an idea of Christ's Person which would render it inconceivable and incredible (see Introduction, p. 106.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">With reference to himself</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus spake these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the discourse which precedes, and then turned from his disciples to the Father. The place where the prayer was offered is comparatively unimportant, yet it must have been uttered somewhere. It has been well suggested that the Lord, with the disciples, sought the comparative quiet of the Father's house, and in some of the courts of the temple, within sight of the golden gate with its mighty <span class="accented">vine</span>, had enacted all that is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15.htm">John 15-17</a>. This does not interfere with the idea that the starry sky was visible to them, and that from some portion of the temple-courts our Lord should have lifted his eyes to heaven; for the heavens are the perpetual symbol of the majesty of God, and show that side on which, by instinctive recognition of the fact, men may and do look out upon the infinite and the eternal. <span class="cmt_word">And having</span> <span class="cmt_word">lifted up his eyes to heaven</span> - or, <span class="accented">lifting</span> (Revised Version) <span class="accented">up his eyes to heaven - <span class="cmt_word"></span>he said</span>, in a voice which the wondering, believing, and troubled disciples might hear (see Ver. 13), and from which they were intended to learn much of the relation between their Lord and the eternal Father. There is a twofold division of the prayer: From Vers. 1-5 <span class="accented">he offers prayer for himself</span>, but in special relation to his own power over and his own grace to the children of men; from Vers. 6-19 he contemplates the special interests of his disciples, in their present forlorn condition, in their work, conflict, and ultimate triumph; from Vers. 19-26 he prays for the whole Church, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> for its unity, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> for its expansion, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> its glory. For himself he has little to ask (Vers. 1-5), but as soon as his word takes the form of intercession for his own (Vers. 6-26), it becomes an irresistible stream of the most fervent love. Sentence rushes upon sentence with wonderful power, yet the repose is never disturbed (Ewald). <span class="cmt_word">Father</span>; not "my Father," nor "our Father," the prayer given to his disciples, nor "my God" as afterwards upon the cross; nor was it the customary address to "God" of either Pharisee or publican; but it recalls the "Abba, Father" of the garden, which passed thence into the experience of the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The hour</span> which has so often presented itself as inevitable, but which so often has receded, and which even now delays its full realization (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2.htm">John 2, 7, 12, 13</a>.) as part of a Divine plan concerning him, the hour of the fiery baptism, of the solemn departure, of the conflict with the prince of this world, and of complete acceptance of the Father's will, <span class="cmt_word">has come; glorify thy Son, that</span> (<span class="cmt_word">thy</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the Son may</span> (<span class="cmt_word">also</span>) <span class="cmt_word">glorify thee</span>. Lift thy Son into the glory which thou hast prepared, that the Son whom thou hast sanctified and sent into the world may glorify thee. It is very noticeable that he speaks of himself in the <span class="accented">third</span> person. This is justified by the fact that he here conspicuously rises out of himself into the consciousness of God, and loses himself in the Father. The glorification of <span class="accented">the Son</span> is first of all by <span class="accented">death</span> issuing in life. He was crowned with glory in order that he might taste death for every man. The conflict, the victorious combat with death, was the beginning of his glory. In taking upon himself all the burden of human sorrow, and exhausting the poison of the sting of death, he would "glorify God" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-19.htm">John 21:19</a>). This does not exhaust the meaning, but the further forms and elements of his glory are referred to afterwards. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-5 Our Lord prayed as a man, and as the Mediator of his people; yet he spoke with majesty and authority, as one with and equal to the Father. Eternal life could not be given to believers, unless Christ, their Surety, both glorified the Father, and was glorified of him. This is the sinner's way to eternal life, and when this knowledge shall be made perfect, holiness and happiness will be fully enjoyed. The holiness and happiness of the redeemed, are especially that glory of Christ, and of his Father, which was the joy set before him, for which he endured the cross and despised the shame; this glory was the end of the sorrow of his soul, and in obtaining it he was fully satisfied. Thus we are taught that our glorifying God is needed as an evidence of our interest in Christ, through whom eternal life is God's free gift.</body></html>
