Holy Father, keep through your own name those whom you have given me, that they may be one, as we are.">John 17:11</a>. During His presence with them there was not this special need for commending them to the Father's care. His relation to them now is as that of a parent blessing and praying for His children before He is taken away from them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm" title="Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.">John 13:33</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept.</span>--Better (comp. previous verse), <span class= "ital">I kept them in Thy name which Thou gavest Me, and guarded them.</span> The pronoun is emphatic. "While I was in the world <span class= "ital">I</span> kept them. I am now praying that Thou wouldest keep them." The words "kept" and "guarded" differ slightly in meaning, the former pointing to the preservation in the truth revealed to them, and the latter to the watchfulness by means of which this result was obtained. The former may be compared to the feeding of the flock, the latter to the care which protects from the wild beasts around. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28-30</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And none of them is lost, but the son of perdition.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">None of them perished, except the son of perdition.</span> The tense is the same as that of the word "guarded." The Good Shepherd watched His flock, and such was His care that none perished but the "son of perdition." Of him the words carefully state that "he perished." He, then, was included in "them which Thou gavest Me." For him there was the same preservation and the same guardianship as for those who remained in the fold. The sheep wandered from the flock, and was lost by his own act. (Comp. especially Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-71.htm" title="He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.">John 6:71</a>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-9.htm" title="That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Of them which you gave me have I lost none.">John 18:9</a>.)<p>The term, "son of perdition," is a well-known Hebrew idiom, by which the lack of qualitative adjectives is supplied by the use of the abstract substantives, which express that quality. A disobedient child is, <span class= "ital">e.g., "</span>a son of disobedience;" other common instances are "children of light," "children of darkness." A "son of perdition" is one in whose nature there is the quality expressed by "perdition." The phrase is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-4.htm" title="Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are you not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood.">Isaiah 57:4</a> to express the apostacy of the Israelites (in English version, "children of transgression"). It occurs once again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>, of the "man of sin." (Comp. Notes there.) It is used, in the Gospel of Nicodemus, of the devil. In the present passage it is difficult to express the meaning in English, because we have no verb of the same root as the abstract substantive "perdition," and no abstract substantive of the same root as the verb "perish." No exact translation can therefore give in English the point of our Lord's words, "And none of them perished except him whose nature it was to perish." Here, as often (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>), the reader who can consult Luther's German will find that he exactly hits the sense: "Und ist keiner von ihnen <span class= "ital">verloren</span> ohne das <span class= "ital">verlorne</span> Kind."<p><span class= "bld">That the scripture might be fulfilled.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-20.htm" title="For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his position as bishop let another take.">Acts 1:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While I was with them</span> (in the world). He speaks of the earthly ministry as completed, and reviews the whole of his influence over them. <span class="cmt_word">I kept them in thy Name which thou hast given me</span>. The very process that I can no longer pursue, and the cessation of which becomes the ground of the plea for the Father's <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. This an earthly father might say, without irreverence, of children whom he was about to leave, but the quality of the <span class="accented">keeping</span> is characterized by the Divine Name which was given him, and that manifested the Sonship which carried with it all the revelation of the Father. <span class="cmt_word">And I guarded</span> (them) - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span> signifies watchful observation; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, guardianship as behind the walls of a fortress - <span class="cmt_word">and not one perished</span> - went to destruction - <span class="cmt_word">except that the son of perdition</span> (has perished). Christ does not say that the son of perdition was given him by the Father and guarded from the evil one, and yet had gone to his own place; the exception refers simply to the "not one perished." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> has occasionally a meaning not exactly equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>, but expresses an exception which does not cover the whole of the ideas involved in the previous clause (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-26.htm">Luke 4:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>, etc.). This awful Hebraistic phrase is used by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>) for antichrist, and numerous phrases of the kind show how a genitive following <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> expresses the full characteristic or the chief feature of certain persons (thus cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.). This victim of perdition, this child of hell, has completed his course; even now he has laid his plans for my destruction and his own. He has so perished <span class="cmt_word">in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> Even if the full telic force of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is preserved here, he does not free the "son of perdition" from the responsibility of his own destruction. The Scripture portraiture of Messiah has been realized. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which has already been quoted by our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>, is probably still in his mind (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-12.htm">Isaiah 57:12, 13</a>). Some commentators - Arch-deacon Watkins, Dean Alford - press the fact that the "son of perdition" must have been among those who were given to Christ by the Father, who were watched, guarded, taught by God; but that Judas nevertheless took his own way and went to his own place. Thoma compares the lost disciple with the lost sheep of the synoptists, as though we had a reference to a true reprobate, a son of Belial, Apollyon, and the like. Moulton justly protests against any countenance being found here for the irrevocable decree. But if the interpretation of the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> given above is sound, there is no inclusion of the traitor among those who are "of the truth," etc.; but he was one who, notwithstanding boundless opportunity, went to his own place in the perversity of his own will. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:11-16 Christ does not pray that they might be rich and great in the world, but that they might be kept from sin, strengthened for their duty, and brought safe to heaven. The prosperity of the soul is the best prosperity. He pleaded with his holy Father, that he would keep them by his power and for his glory, that they might be united in affection and labours, even according to the union of the Father and the Son. He did not pray that his disciples should be removed out of the world, that they might escape the rage of men, for they had a great work to do for the glory of God, and the benefit of mankind. But he prayed that the Father would keep them from the evil, from being corrupted by the world, the remains of sin in their hearts, and from the power and craft of Satan. So that they might pass through the world as through an enemy's country, as he had done. They are not left here to pursue the same objects as the men around them, but to glorify God, and to serve their generation. The Spirit of God in true Christians is opposed to the spirit of the world.</body></html>
