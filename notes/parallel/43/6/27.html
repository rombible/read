It will be instructive to compare the other passages in this Gospel where the word occurs: <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a> (<span class= "ital">wrought</span> in God); <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>. <span class= "ital">Work not</span> is better than "work not for," by which the words have been sometimes rendered The sense is, "Work not out--let it not be the result of your constant working--to have food (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-32.htm" title="But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.">John 4:32</a>) which perisheth; but let your work be one worthy of your endeavour, food which endureth unto eternal life, which food the Son of Man will give to you."<p><span class= "bld">For him hath God the Father sealed.</span>--The emphasis of the original is seen better by preserving the order of the words, <span class= "ital">for Him hath the Father sealed, even God.</span> (Comp.

Christ did not mean that these multitudes were not to toil for their daily bread, which could only be secured for them by labour and the sweat of the brow; <span class="cmt_word">but to labour for the food which endureth</span> (or, <span class="accented">abideth</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto eternal life</span> (this last clause Moulton would separate from the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and considers to relate to the principal verb of the sentence; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "labour for the abiding food," <span class="accented">with a view to, or unto, eternal life</span>). The bread that abideth unto eternal life, however, corresponds very closely with the water of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>), which, when once appropriated, flows and springs up with perennial energy within the soul, conferring the consciousness and the beginning of eternal life. There is a food which is imperishable and incorruptible, feeding the heavenly life within the soul, and which, if once assimilated, becomes Divine life itself. Labour for that life <span class="cmt_word">which the Son of man will give to you</span>. This grand idea, viz. the gift of eternal life in and by Christ himself, was one of the main themes of the Gospel of John. Christ knew himself to be the Giver of eternal life - a life of perfect blessedness, irrespective of time, and sense, and flesh, and the world, and death. The Lord here calls himself "Son of man," rather than "Son of God." The whole of the subsequent discourse expands and rests upon this gift of the perfect and blessed life in and by his <span class="accented">humanity</span>. In the previous chapter attention was called to the Divine Sonship and the Divine activity. Here equal emphasis was laid upon the <span class="accented">human</span> sonship and on the acceptance and assimilation by man of this supreme gift. The power or function of the Son of man to bestow this life is sustained by the assertion, <span class="cmt_word">For him</span> (this very one) <span class="cmt_word">the Father, even God, hath sealed.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a>)means here to ratify and accredit as worthy and competent to discharge such duties, to render indubitable, to confirm by outward visible sign. or seal, as one empowered to do so Divine a thing. The Father has made "the Son of man" the steward of his bounty. The Son of man has the key to this boundless treasure, this eternal blessing. Men, however, must labour to receive so great a gift. It will prove to be a gift, even if they put forth the most strenuous energy to receive it. This first dialogue contrasts the carnal and spiritual reasons for seeking Jesus, and brings into sharp relief the Galilaean conception of the Christ, as Miracle worker, temporal Potentate, prophetic Leader of some vast host of triumphant enthusiasts, and contrasts with it the Lord's own conception. of himself as the Giver, the Medium, the divinely appointed Almoner of a spiritual blessing, for which, while the Father-God freely and lavishly gives it, the sons of men must eagerly toil. The next question and answer bring out the moral condition on which alone the gift can be dispensed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:22-27 Instead of answering the inquiry how he came there, Jesus blamed their asking. The utmost earnestness should be employed in seeking salvation, in the use of appointed means; yet it is to be sought only as the gift of the Son of man. Him the Father has sealed, proved to be God. He declared the Son of man to be the Son of God with power.</body></html>
