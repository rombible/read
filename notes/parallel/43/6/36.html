You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37-44</a>, and was perhaps uttered then, or, more probably, to those whom He is now addressing. That there are many words of Christ which have not been preserved to us is certain. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:">John 20:30-31</a>.)

It is not "ye in addition to others," but <span class= "ital">Ye have even seen Me.</span> Ye have not simply been told, but have had the fullest evidence, amounting to actual seeing. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.">John 20:29</a>.)

It introduces the melancholy statement, that the one thing which is requisite to the full realization of the gift is that of which these questioners are ignorant) <span class="cmt_word">I told you</span> - I said unto you - <span class="cmt_word">that you have both seen me, and believe me not</span>; or "that you have seen me, and yet believe not." Some difficulty has arisen from our not being able to find, in the previous dialogue, the exact words here quoted. Some have supposed it to refer to an unrecorded conversation (Alford, Westcott), or even to some written sentence which is now a lost fragment of the discourse. Meyer says (without answering the suggestions of Olshausen, Hengstenberg, Godet, and others), that there is no such statement in the context, and proposes to translate <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (as he says it is not unfrequently found in Greek tragedians, as if it were equivalent to <span class="accented">dictum velim</span>) "I would have you told;" but there is no such usage in the New Testament, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a> does not seem a parallel ease. It is not at all probable that Jesus was referring to the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>, words which were addressed to a different audience - to "Jews" at Jerusalem, and uttered many months before (Lucke and De Wette). But ver. 26 shows that Galilaeans had come to see him, and had come without belief in the great sign of his spiritual nature and claims which he had already granted. They had <span class="accented">seen</span> him and his great miracles, it is true; but they simply longed in consequence for "more bread" and "more healing," not for himself. In ver. 30 he draws from them a confession that they had not seen enough to believe him. This thought recurs not infrequently. "Have I been so long with you, and yet hast thou not known <span class="accented">me, Philip?"</span> "Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>). The setting forth of himself ought to have induced belief apart even from works. He is so intensely conscious of the Divine reality himself, that he marvels at the unbelief of his hearers. Let them think as he does, and immediately the lifelong hunger and thirst of their souls would be satisfied. Seeing, however, is not believing in their ease; and he has already urged them to consider this lamentable spiritual blindness of theirs. The exclamation of this verse recites the obvious inference of the verses we have referred to, condenses into a sentence the spirit of what he had said, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:36-46 The discovery of their guilt, danger, and remedy, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, makes men willing and glad to come, and to give up every thing which hinders applying to him for salvation. The Father's will is, that not one of those who were given to the Son, should be rejected or lost by him. No one will come, till Divine grace has subdued, and in part changed his heart; therefore no one who comes will ever be cast out. The gospel finds none willing to be saved in the humbling, holy manner, made known therein; but God draws with his word and the Holy Ghost; and man's duty is to hear and learn; that is to say, to receive the grace offered, and consent to the promise. None had seen the Father but his beloved Son; and the Jews must expect to be taught by his inward power upon their minds, and by his word, and the ministers whom he sent among them.</body></html>
