He was one of the two disciples of the Baptist who first followed Jesus, and John's own companion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>). He is always named as one of the first group of the Twelve (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-2.htm" title="Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;">Matthew 10:2</a>), and in some way was specially connected with Philip (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>). Here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-22.htm" title="Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.">John 12:22</a> (see Note), they are named together, and also in the lists in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-18.htm" title="And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,">Mark 3:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then saith one of his disciples to him, viz. Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span> The spokesman is here specially indicated. On other occasions Andrew is singled out as the brother of Simon and friend of Philip (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-22.htm">John 12:22</a>). This repeated reference to the illustrious brother of Simon is a refutation of the ill-natured charge against the author of the Gospel, that he aimed at the depreciation of the character of the great apostle. Moreover, it is interesting to remember that in the <span class="accented">Muratorian</span> fragment on the Canon, "Andrew" is specially mentioned as being one of those present with John in Ephesus, who urged him to write his Gospel (see Introduction, IV. 2 (3)). <span class="cmt_word">There is</span> <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">lad</span> <span class="cmt_word">here</span> (possibly a lad who was brought with themselves, or who had attached himself to the twelve) <span class="cmt_word">who has five barley loaves</span>, the bread of the poorest classes. Of this there is ample proof ('Sotah,' 2:1, quoted by Edersheim, vol. 1:681): "While all other meat offerings were of wheat, that brought by the woman accused of adultery was to be of <span class="accented">barley</span>, because, as her deed is that of the animals, so her offering is of the food of animals." If this lad was conveying the food stock of the Lord and his apostles, it is an impressive but accidental hint that "for our sakes he became poor," and classed himself socially with the humblest. <span class="cmt_word">And two fishes</span>. The use of this word is peculiar to our Gospel (Luke, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>; Mark, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the ordinary word for "fish; "but John uses the word <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the diminutive of the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which means "savoury," eaten with bread). This opsarion mostly consisted of small fishes caught in the lake, which were dried, salted as "sardines" or "anchovies" are with ourselves for a similar purpose. This habit belonged locally to the neighbourhood of the lake, and reveals the Galilman origin or associations of the writer. The Aramaic word, <span class="accented">ophsonim</span>, is derived from the Greek <span class="accented">opson</span>, and that of <span class="accented">aphjain</span>, or <span class="accented">aphiz</span>, is the name for a small fish caught in the lake, the drying of which was a lucrative source of industry. Edersheim reminds us that the fish laid on the charcoal fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9, 10, 13</a>) was "<span class="accented">opsarion</span>," and that of this the risen Lord, on the shore of this very lake, gave to his disciples to eat, though he guided them at that time to a shoal of <span class="accented">great fishes</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and bade them add some of these to the <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, which he was content to use still. The use of this word on these two occasions shows that, at the last, our Lord reminds his disciples of the miraculous feeding by the shore of the lake; and both narratives breathe the air of the northern parts of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">But what are these among so many?</span> The same lesson of the insufficiency of human resources to meet great human needs is suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21-23</a>. Our resources at the very best are quite exhausted. Our best, our all, avails little - an expression which would apply to the numberless offers of our poor humanity and of our limited faculties to meet the moral starvation of the world. Take the Old Testament: how can the dispensation of all its provision satisfy <span class="accented">per se</span> the need of mankind as a whole? Greek philosophy, even if it satisfy the few, the leisurely, the cynical, the learned, the wise men of the West, what will it do for the poor, the broken hearted, the consciously guilty? The good things of this life are equally powerless, and the proposals of even truth itself, apart from the gracious operations of the Spirit, would fail to meet the wants or necessities of the unbelieving. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-14 John relates the miracle of feeding the multitude, for its reference to the following discourse. Observe the effect this miracle had upon the people. Even the common Jews expected the Messiah to come into the world, and to be a great Prophet. The Pharisees despised them as not knowing the law; but they knew most of Him who is the end of the law. Yet men may acknowledge Christ as that Prophet, and still turn a deaf ear to him.</body></html>
