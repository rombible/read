This last passage is an interesting confirmation of our text. The usage implies on the part of the four evangelists familiar acquaintance with the scenery. <span class="cmt_word">And there he sat</span> <span class="cmt_word">down</span> <span class="cmt_word">with</span> <span class="cmt_word">his disciples</span>.

Women and little children are in the crowd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a>). Weiss, who argues that the main features of the narrative are deeply imbedded in all the traditions, summarily disposes of the later accounts of the similar event recited by Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-1.htm">Mark 8:1-11</a>) and Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32-38</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-14 John relates the miracle of feeding the multitude, for its reference to the following discourse. Observe the effect this miracle had upon the people. Even the common Jews expected the Messiah to come into the world, and to be a great Prophet. The Pharisees despised them as not knowing the law; but they knew most of Him who is the end of the law. Yet men may acknowledge Christ as that Prophet, and still turn a deaf ear to him.</body></html>
