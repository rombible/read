Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>.) St. Matthew tells us there were five thousand men besides the women and children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a>; see Note there).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Jesus said (the omission of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> rather augments the vivid force of the statement), <span class="cmt_word">Make the people</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> here. contrasted with the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of the next clause) recline. <span class="cmt_word">Now there was much grass in the place.</span> As already said, this is in harmony with the note of time conveyed in ver. 4. The other evangelist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-39.htm">Mark 6:39</a>) speaks of the people sitting down "upon the green grass" - a vivid touch this of an eyewitness; Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a>) also speaks of the grass; and Mark and Luke add another rememberable feature which John omits. <span class="cmt_word">The men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, which last term may have included the "women and children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a>), who in no great numbers probably formed, according to Eastern custom, a company by themselves). The men <span class="cmt_word">sat down</span> (reclined), <span class="cmt_word">in number</span> - the matter of the "number" is here put into the "accusative of closer definition" (Meyer) - <span class="cmt_word">about five</span> <span class="cmt_word">thousand</span>. Luke says, "in groups of fifty." Mark first declares that Jesus ordered them to sit down (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) in parties, and describes the result as having the appearance of garden beds (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>), of fifty or of a hundred each. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> is <span class="accented">area, forus</span> (Gartenbett; Homer, "Od.," 7:127; 24:247). "<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>," says Theophylact, "are the different divisions in gardens, in which different herbs are often planted." The image of the garden plots, with different divisions between them, forced itself on the eyewitness (see Trench, "Miracles," p. 205). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-14 John relates the miracle of feeding the multitude, for its reference to the following discourse. Observe the effect this miracle had upon the people. Even the common Jews expected the Messiah to come into the world, and to be a great Prophet. The Pharisees despised them as not knowing the law; but they knew most of Him who is the end of the law. Yet men may acknowledge Christ as that Prophet, and still turn a deaf ear to him.</body></html>
