Literally, we should read, <span class= "ital">If then ye should behold the Son of Man ascending up where He was before?</span> The Ascension would be the proof of the coming down from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-58.htm" title="This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eats of this bread shall live for ever.">John 6:58</a>), which is part of the teaching they cannot now accept. The margin refers to the more formal statement of this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>. The reader should also compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>, where the Ascension is again assumed, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9-10</a>. Comments on these incidental references by St. John to an event he does not record have been made too frequently without noting that, in each case, the speaker is Jesus, to whose thoughts this end of subjection to earthly laws, in subjecting them to Himself, was ever present. St. John, in his own narrative, nowhere mentions the fact of the Ascension, nor does he in any way refer to it. That he could write these words without doing so is an assurance of his own knowledge of the glorious sequel of the Resurrection, and of its unquestioned acceptance in the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 62.</span> - <span class="accented">If</span> it does put difficulties in your way, then how will it be <span class="cmt_word">if you behold the Son of man ascending up to where he was before?</span> This unfinished and ambiguous sentence and query have been variously interpreted. Some have argued that our Lord here simply refers to the "resurrection;" that he told his hearers they would have an opportunity of observing that, after death, he would return to where he was before, that is, to the conditions of earthly life. The striking antithesis between "descending from" and "ascending" almost compels the repudiation of this view. Did Christ, however, mean to ask them whether, under the new condition of things, all ground of offence would not be taken away? or to imply that their faith would have to be put to a still greater strain, and that they would stumble at length irretrievably? Lucke, De Wette, Kuinoel, Meyer, chiefly urge the latter, and on the ground: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That in John's Gospel the death of Christ is always looked at as his real glorification, and that therefore by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, he was referring in his euphemistic fashion to his death in the true Johannine phrase as a going to God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a>, a return to the Father; 14; 16:5, 28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That John does not describe the Ascension as a physical fact. Meyer does not allow that <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a> and John 20:17 are sufficient with this phrase to justify such a reference to the great event referred to by Mark, Luke, and Paul, and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Against Meyer and those who agree with him it should be noticed that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is never used for "death" of Christ. The phrases, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, etc., are used for this purpose. Moreover, when a phrase was wanted to denote the twofold idea of uplifting on the cross and ascension to the skies, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is the word twice used in the Fourth Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32-34</a>). Moreover, if death could be realized as such a <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of glory and fulness of life, the offence of the cross, and scandal of participation in and dependence upon the flesh and blood of Christ, would be reduced and not augmented. To Meyer's objection that these Galilaean disciples would not see the ascending Christ, and therefore the supposition would be tantalizing, it is sufficient to reply <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, in a similar sense, there was no reason to suppose they would see the Lord suffer and die upon the cross; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, as Christ Jesus was evidently "set forth as crucified" among the Galatians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>), so these Galilaean disciples, through the vision of the apostles, would verily see the Son of man suffer, die, and ascend. Apart also from the inappropriateness of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> convey the subtle thought of the transfiguration of death as such, there was not, apart from resurrection and ascension to glory - which is the additional matter to which our Lord referred - any justification of the phrase, whereas it coincides decidedly with the expressions used of the pre-existing glory of the great Personality who, though calling himself "Son of man," yet consciously refers to his existence before the world was (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). Again, the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of these words stands in imposing antithesis to the repeated use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of the previous discourse. He had been sent "from heaven," "sent by the living Father," he had "come down from heaven," "to give himself and his flesh for the life of the world" and he now leads his disciples to suspend their murmuring at the form of his discourse. They may behold and see a greater marvel yet, such a losing of his humanity in God and glory, that they will be able to apprehend more fully what he means by eating his flesh and drinking his blood. Of course, there might be some who are so entirely obtuse to the conception of this close identification with him during the time of his manifestation in the flesh, that they will be still more powerless to receive the spiritual interpretation when, for believing minds, the idea would become clear. John recorded this discourse a generation after the mighty effects of the Resurrection and Ascension had been produced. We know that long before he presented these outlines the ideas presented in it had been widely diffused. St. Paul had spoken of Christ as "the second Man from heaven," as invested and clothed in a "spiritual body," as "the last Adam," as "a life-giving Spirit," and the Epistle to the Hebrews had represented him as "having passed through the heavens that he might fill all things. Whence came such august ideas about the Man Jesus, if not from himself? The offence of the cross has never ceased, and Athenians and many since have mocked at the story of the Resurrection and Ascension; but notwithstanding this, there is an ever-increasing multitude who from the day of his ascension till now have been finally convinced. They have understood, as they would never have done without such help, that it was possible, since he had passed through these heavens that he might fill all things, to hold the most entire and intimate communion with him, both as the God-Man and as the Paschal Lamb. Moreover, the prince of this world has been cast out and judged because Christ has gone to the Father. He has been lifted up, and is drawing all men to himself. When the Son of man in the continuity of his Person shall be beheld as ascending into the glory from which he in his Divine nature descended, then those who stumbled at the idea of intimate life-giving participation in himself will "come to see that the words can only be understood spiritually" (Moulton). The ascension of the humanity to the life and glory of the pre-existent Deity of the Son of God was a conception firmly grasped by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-9</a>), and must have been based on the Lord's own words. It is only by the exaltation of the man into God that we are able to participate in the Divine humanity. Weiss, unfortunately, cannot believe that there was any reference to the visible ascent to heaven, but simply to the termination of his earthly labours. The question, then, of ver. 62 is left to find its own answer and to give its own suggestion. But the interpretation here offered is strongly confirmed by - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:60-65 The human nature of Christ had not before been in heaven, but being God and man, that wondrous Person was truly said to have come down from heaven. The Messiah's kingdom was not of this world; and they were to understand by faith, what he had said of a spiritual living upon him, and his fulness. As without the soul of man the flesh is of no value, so without the quickening Spirit of God all forms of religion are dead and worthless. He who made this provision for our souls, alone can teach us these things, and draw us unto Christ, that we may live by faith in him. Let us apply to Christ, thankful that it is declared that every one who is willing to come unto him shall be made welcome.</body></html>
