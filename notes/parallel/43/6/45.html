[LXX., 38.] 34, for the same thought in other words). Godet suggests that the former passage was in the <span class="accented">haphtora</span>, from the prophets - the lesson for the day. If the discourse was uttered in the synagogue of Capernaum, this is not impossible. At all events, the "and" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) which here follows suggests that the quotation is taken from Isaiah. And they shall all be taught of God; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. direct teaching by God is the prime requisite of any spiritual apprehension, even of the mysteries of Christ the Revealer. This solemn truth is affirmed by the entire history of Christ. The vision of his majesty, even contact with his ineffable love, the sight of his humiliation and of the shedding of his precious blood, did not, by any necessarily acting law of mind, induce faith. Divine teaching by the Spirit of the Father and Son is the preliminary (see notes on John 16:5-8, on the mission of the Comforter) to believing on Christ. "Taught of God" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), translated in Vulgate, <span class="accented">docibiles Dei</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>), means more than the reception of one lesson in the school of God, and suggests a prolonged experience and a rich communion between the Teacher and the taught. <span class="cmt_word">Every</span> <span class="cmt_word">one</span> (therefore) [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, referring to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 45<span class="accented">a</span>, and to the quotation, is not so much every human being, as the "all" of the Messianic kingdom - the "all" of God's "sons" and "<span class="accented">children</span> "] <span class="cmt_word">that hath heard</span> <span class="cmt_word">from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father, and hath learned</span> (<span class="accented">of him</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>cometh unto me.</span> Hearing may end in heedlessness, even when the Lord God Almighty speaks with us. His revelations at great epochs, his inner voice at special moments in our religious history, may be disregarded. The voice of God may be heard, yet not obeyed; the voice of conscience and revelation and inspiration, the sacred monitions and warnings of the heart, may all be slighted. But every one that hath heard the Father, and has also accepted the lesson - has felt the Divine drawing; being willing to do the will of the Father, he knows of the doctrine, whether it be of God, and he comes to Christ. Later on, Christ said, "Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice." It is one thing to "hear," another to "learn," another to "come." These three stages still further illumine the "drawing" of the Father, and the method which the Father has adopted of so giving men to Christ that he may ultimately fold them in his arms and press them to his heart. Lest, however, the hearers of Jesus, then or now, should conclude that the kind of direct teaching of which the prophets spake, and which he endorsed, was of that immediate kind which himself enjoyed, and which alone justifies this language, he continued - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:36-46 The discovery of their guilt, danger, and remedy, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, makes men willing and glad to come, and to give up every thing which hinders applying to him for salvation. The Father's will is, that not one of those who were given to the Son, should be rejected or lost by him. No one will come, till Divine grace has subdued, and in part changed his heart; therefore no one who comes will ever be cast out. The gospel finds none willing to be saved in the humbling, holy manner, made known therein; but God draws with his word and the Holy Ghost; and man's duty is to hear and learn; that is to say, to receive the grace offered, and consent to the promise. None had seen the Father but his beloved Son; and the Jews must expect to be taught by his inward power upon their minds, and by his word, and the ministers whom he sent among them.</body></html>
