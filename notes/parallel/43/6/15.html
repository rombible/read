He knows also the reason of Christ's retirement, while St. Matthew and St. Mark only state the fact that He retired to pray. They knew not that He wished to avoid that throng of people who thought of the Messiah as a temporal king, and would have borne Him with them to the great feast at the royal city. St. Luke does not contain this section, but comp. the question recorded by him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-18.htm" title="But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.">John 9:18</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> which grows immediately out of it.<p><span class= "bld">A mountain.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the mountain,</span> or <span class= "ital">the hill-country</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-3.htm" title="And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.">John 6:3</a>). He withdrew again to the place where He was before.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore knowing</span> (having found, perceived (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>), by ominous movements in the crowd, or in any other way still more explicit) <span class="cmt_word">that they were about to come and</span> by violence, or force, <span class="cmt_word">seize him in order that they might make him King.</span> This movement was not an unnatural one. They were on the way to Jerusalem, and they were thirsting to throw off the yoke of Rome and of Herod, and probably indignant to the extreme with the "deep damnation" of John the Baptist's death. In such a frame, the display of power and resources which they had just witnessed pointed Jesus out as their popular idol, and encouraged the belief, which did not die out till it was quenched in blood. The bald suggestion would clash absolutely with the Lord's own plan, with the Father's design concerning him. It would seem that the disciples manifested great reluctance to leave Christ or the crowd; for both Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22</a>) and Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a>) imply that Jesus had to use special means to induce them to depart (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). He compelled them to do so. If we had nothing but the synoptic narrative to guide us, we might suppose that Jesus had difficulty in resisting the desire of the disciples to remain always at his side; or that the intensity of their affection was interfering too much with the need in which he felt of retirement and solitude. John's statement here illumines the language of the other Gospels. The disciples themselves were strongly moved by the passions of the thousands; they were sharing in the general enthusiasm. To quench such an unholy or unspiritual view of the true Prophet and King, the disciples must be separated from the crowd, and Christ had to overcome by some special utterance of his authority the reluctance of the twelve to embark in their ship. Having done this, and without their help, he sent the multitudes away. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">withdrew</span>, <span class="cmt_word">for the second time, to the mountain</span> (cf. ver. 3), and this time <span class="cmt_word">himself alone.</span> These occasional separations from the apostles were undoubtedly part of the discipline to which they were subjected. They were taught that, when he was no longer visible to them, he might still be spiritually present and able to succour them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:15-21 Here were Christ's disciples in the way of duty, and Christ was praying for them; yet they were in distress. There may be perils and afflictions of this present time, where there is an interest in Christ. Clouds and darkness often surround the children of the light and of the day. They see Jesus walking on the sea. Even the approaches of comfort and deliverance often are so mistaken, as to become the occasions of fear. Nothing is more powerful to convince sinners than that word, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest; nothing more powerful to comfort saints than this, I am Jesus whom thou lovest. If we have received Christ Jesus the Lord, though the night be dark, and the wind high, yet we may comfort ourselves, we shall be at the shore before long.</body></html>
