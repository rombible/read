The common text has inserted the opening words of these verses. There can be no doubt that the change indicated gives the original reading, and it will be seen that the relation of "Father" and "Son" is thus preserved.<p><span class= "bld">Every one which seeth the Son.</span>--We pass here to the individuals who compose the great mass of humanity. It is the divine will that no one should be excluded, but that he may have eternal life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-15.htm" title="That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.">John 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>): this is the Father's gift in the person of the Son. The exercise of the mental power to see Him, the reception of Him and trust upon Him: this is man's acceptance of God's gift. The word rendered "seeth" means to look upon, to contemplate, and is the first step towards a true faith.<p>The analogy of the previous verse makes it probable that we should render the last clause of this verse, <span class= "ital">and that I should raise him up at the last day.</span> The difference of tenses is important. The believer has now the principle of eternal life, but this is to be his in its fulness when he shall be raised up at the last day. This thought of the final victory is the joyous refrain of these verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-54.htm" title="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>). The spirit brought into communion with the original source of life becomes life in itself. This life is greater than death, and cannot be holden by it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">this</span> <span class="cmt_word">is the will of</span> <span class="cmt_word">my Father</span> (or, <span class="accented">of him that sent me</span>), <span class="cmt_word">that every one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, instead of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> of vers. 37, 39), treated separately and individually, who <span class="accented">beholdeth</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. steadily and continuously contemplates - <span class="cmt_word">the Son</span> (here he identifies himself with the revelation of the sonship in his own Person) <span class="cmt_word">and believeth on him</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. entrusts himself in a full moral surrender to <span class="cmt_word">the Son</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> must be here especially noticed) as thus revealed - <span class="cmt_word">should have eternal life</span>. This is the sublime law of Divine arrangement, and the fullest expression of the will of the Father (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>, "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life"). "<span class="accented">Behold and trust</span>." These are the conditions. The steady gaze, the full perception of the Divine Son-ship that is adequately expressed in the Son of man, issues by a Divine arrangement in life eternal. The blessedness of the life of faith, its elevation above the conditions of corruption and decay, are not all which he promises, for he added, <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (perhaps the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is carried on to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, and so the word is in subj. aor. rather than fut. indic., and, if so, the sentence may express the fact), <span class="cmt_word">that I should raise him</span> (not "it;" cf. ver. 39) <span class="cmt_word">at the last day.</span> It is not improbable, as we have seen, that our Lord uttered these verses (37-40) to the innermost circle of his followers. The first discourse closes with ver. 36. The disciples looked with eager and inquisitive glances at each other and at their Lord, and received these teachings of the Lord concerning the relation he was sustaining to the Father, and the claim he made to be the Almoner of the mercy and minister of the judgment of him that sent him. This great utterance corresponds with the celebrated synoptic recital (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26, 27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:36-46 The discovery of their guilt, danger, and remedy, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, makes men willing and glad to come, and to give up every thing which hinders applying to him for salvation. The Father's will is, that not one of those who were given to the Son, should be rejected or lost by him. No one will come, till Divine grace has subdued, and in part changed his heart; therefore no one who comes will ever be cast out. The gospel finds none willing to be saved in the humbling, holy manner, made known therein; but God draws with his word and the Holy Ghost; and man's duty is to hear and learn; that is to say, to receive the grace offered, and consent to the promise. None had seen the Father but his beloved Son; and the Jews must expect to be taught by his inward power upon their minds, and by his word, and the ministers whom he sent among them.</body></html>
