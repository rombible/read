Chronological difficulties beset our treatment of this miraculous narrative with its varied consequences and results. Many curious and even violent measures have been resorted to with a view to solve them. Some have supposed that ch. 5. and 6. have been inverted in order, and that thus the presence of our Lord in Galilee, mentioned in ch. 4, would account for the statement of ch. 6:1 and the journey to Jerusalem of ch. 5:1, be brought into closer relation with ch. 7. We cannot see the faintest indication or evidence whatever of any such treatment of the Gospel by the authors of the manuscripts or the quotations or versions. The evangelist has just completed his record of the conflict between Jesus and the recognized leaders of the people in Jerusalem. He had introduced our Lord's own vindication (based on the highest grounds) of his own right to deal with the rabbinical restrictions upon sabbath duty. These grounds were the eternal relations of his own inner nature and consciousness with the Father's. On no occasion had Christ made the uniqueness of his personal claims and powers more explicit. He called for entire obedience to his word as the condition of eternal life, and as the key to the Scriptures of God. If we had no synoptic tradition to give a closer historical setting of the narrative which here follows, we might take Meyer's view, and say that the "after these things" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) of ver. 1 referred to the discourse of the previous chapter, and that the "departed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) referred to Jerusalem as its starting point; and, notwithstanding the extreme awkwardness of the expression, we might have supposed that "the other side" of the sea was the other side of it from Jerusalem (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>). Some commentators appear to have a morbid fear of reducing a difficulty, or seeing a harmony, between these four narratives. One thing is dear, that they are independent of one another, are not derived from each other, do each involve side views of the event distinct from the rest, and yet concur in the same general representation. The synoptists, however, place the "feeding of the multitudes" in the midst of a group of most remarkable and varied events. It is for them one page out of many descriptive of the Galilaean ministry, and which ultimately led to grievous departure from and diminution of the temporary popularity of the great Prophet. It would seem that bitter hostility, as well as excited enthusiasm, was checkering his early ministry. The synoptics take pains to show the combined effect of his self-revelations <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> on his own fellow townsmen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-1.htm">Mark 6:1-6</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> upon his own family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-19.htm">Mark 3:19-21, 31-35</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> upon the populace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-31.htm">Matthew 15:31</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> upon Herod Antipas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14-16</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> upon the twelve disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-28</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> upon John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> upon the Father in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1-13</a> and parallel passages). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The canvas is crowded with scenes, the signs and wonders of healing and teaching are abundant.

And we judge from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10</a> that this very excitement, amounting to feverish self-glorification on their part, appears to have been one at least of our Lord's motives for the temporary withdrawal of his disciples from the multitudes. Another event of singular significance contributed to the same result. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-12.htm">Matthew 14:12</a>) takes the opportunity of describing the tragic close of John's imprisonment, and relates how John's "disciples came to tell Jesus" of the bloody deed. A sudden panic was felt by the multitude. A crisis had arrived. The great Prophet must avenge his forerunner's death or lose his hold upon the affections of the fickle mass. The people appeared to the eyes of Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>) "as sheep without a shepherd." He had compassion on them, but he must make them understand the nature of the royalty as well as of the realm of the Messianic King. The true grounds for Christ's retirement are not incompatible, but mutually explanatory. The death of the renowned forerunner, of the idol of the multitude brought vividly to the mind of the Lord his own death - the foreseen sacrifice of himself. The conviction that he must give himself to a violent death - give his flesh to the hungry and starving multitude, made the decadence of his popularity in Galilee a certain consequence of any right apprehension of his mission or claims. This mastery over the powers of nature which his compassion for others prevailed on him to manifest would be misunderstood. The moral and mystic meaning of it was far more important than the superficial inferences drawn by the Galilaeans. The real lesson of the miracle would grievously offend them. But it sank deeply into the apostolic mind, and hence the various aspects which it presents in the fourfold narrative. John selects this one specimen of the Galilaean ministry on account of its typical character, and records the high and wonderful results which the Lord educed from this high and striking manifestation of his power. There is, moreover, remarkable correspondence between the fifth and sixth chapters in this respect, that Galilee, like Jerusalem, recoils from the highest claims of Jesus, and developed an antagonism or an indifference as deadly if not as malignant as that which has displayed itself in the metropolis. "He came to his own, and his own received him not." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span> (see note on John 5:1; not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, which would mean after this particular scene in Jerusalem) - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. after a group of events, one of which may have been this visit to the metropolis, but which included also the early Galilaean ministry as presented in the synoptic narrative, and with which John and his readers were familiar - Jesus departed from the side of the sea on which he was, and as we may judge (ver. 24) from Capernaum, now known to be his chief resting place, most probably the home of his mother, brothers, and nearest friends, <span class="cmt_word">to the other side of the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias</span>; or, <span class="accented">of the Galilaean sea of Tiberias</span>. It does not follow that the evangelist had the southernmost portion of the lake in his mind (as Meyer suggests). Tiberius was the showy city built by Herod Antipas on the western shore of the lake. Herod called the place after the name of Tiberius Caesar, and conferred upon it many Gentile characteristics. From the time of Antipas to that of Agrippa it was the chief town of the tetrarchy. After the destruction of Jerusalem it became for centuries the site era celebrated school of Hebrew learning, and one of the sacred cities of the Jews. Jewish tradition makes it the scene of the last judgment and the resurrection of the dead. It was a modern city, which may account for the omission of its name in the synoptic narrative. Christ never visited it that we know cf. He preferred the fishing village of Bethsaida, or the more thoroughly Hebrew aspect of Capernaum. Nevertheless, "Tiberias" gave to Gentile cars the best and least dubious designation of the lake. So Pausanias (5, 7, 3) calls it the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> ("the lake Tiber"). Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a>) calls it the "Lake Gennesaret<span class="accented"></span>," and Matthew and Mark "the Sea of Galilee" without any other epithet. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1</a>) calls it "the Sea of Tiberias." This multiplicity of lake names, due in the first instance to some peculiarity of the including shores, finds easy parallels in Derwentwater and Keswick Lake, and in the "Lake of the Four Cantons," called also" Lake of Luzern," etc. Christ sought retirement from the surging crowd, and for himself and his excited disciples a time of rest and communion with the Father, who had accepted, as part of his Divine plan, the awful sacrifice of the life of John the Baptist. He went "by ship," says Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13</a>) to a desert place. In Luke's account this solitary place was towards or near (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) a city called "Bethsaida." It is difficult to believe that this is the familiar Bethsaida or "fishing town," situated a little south of Capernaum, because we are met in the account of Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a>) with the statement that, after the miracle, the disciples were urged to go to the other side of the lake (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>) towards Bethsaida. This, compared with ver. 17, is obviously in the same direction as Capernaum. Indeed, the term, "Bethsaida of Galilee," referred to in ch. 12:21 (as the Apostle Philip's residence), seems used with the view of distinguishing it from some other place of the same name. Now, Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02, 1) mentions a <span class="accented">Bethsaida Julias</span> situated on the northeastern extremity of the lake. The "ruins of this city may be still seen on the rising hilly ground which here retires somewhat from the river and the lake. It was situated in <span class="accented">Gaulonitis</span>, in the tetrarchy of Philip, and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of Herod, yet not far from the road into Peraea by which the Galilaean pilgrims to the metropolis might be expected to travel. The silence of these hills provided the opportunity of retirement. But it was frustrated by the eager excitement of the multitude. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-14 John relates the miracle of feeding the multitude, for its reference to the following discourse. Observe the effect this miracle had upon the people. Even the common Jews expected the Messiah to come into the world, and to be a great Prophet. The Pharisees despised them as not knowing the law; but they knew most of Him who is the end of the law. Yet men may acknowledge Christ as that Prophet, and still turn a deaf ear to him.</body></html>
