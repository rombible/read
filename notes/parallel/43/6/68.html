And striking is his speech. "Go away? To whom? They had left all to follow Him, and find all in Him. The Baptist is not living, and they know no other teacher. Go away? How could it be, when His words are spirit and eternal life?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 68, 69.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Simon Peter</span> - prominent here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-6.htm">John 13:6-11, 24, 36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>, etc.; just as he is in the synoptic Gospels (see portrait of St. Peter, Introduction VIII. 3 (4)) - [then ] <span class="cmt_word">answered him;Lord, to whom shall we go?</span> Perhaps <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> is even stronger than the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; Hast thou not drawn us to thyself, and supplied a need and craving which thou hadst first of all excited? Is there any teacher to rival thee? Can we look for another while we have thee? "Da nobis alterum te" (Augustine). The second part of this immortal reply points clearly back to ver. 63, where the Lord had declared that the words he had spoken to them were spirit and life. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast words of eternal life.</span> Not "the words," which would savour too much of the dogmatic and technical, but <span class="accented">words of life</span> - words which minister the Spirit of life; words which convey the Divine power, even the Holy Spirit, to our minds; words which bring those thoughts before us which we can believe, and believing which, we have eternal life. "Thou hast such words" (cf. for use of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>). The third item of this confession is twofold. <span class="cmt_word">We have believed, and have come to know</span>; so that we now do believe and know that, etc. There is a knowledge which precedes belief, and there are some great facts and ideas about Christ which lead to a higher and to a different belief (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-8.htm">John 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>); but again the fullest knowledge follows belief, a notional and real assent leads to an invincible assent. Faith is the womb of assurance. This richer knowledge is mediated by love. "He that loveth not knoweth not," and the faith that evokes "love" also excites and confirms the "knowledge" that is life eternal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>). That thou art the Holy One of God The recognition of the nature of the Lord, which fell short of the great utterance of Peter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>. This was an ascription which the daemoniacs, or the devils, by their lips were ready from the first to proclaim prematurely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-34.htm">Luke 4:34</a>). (On the holiness of Christ, on his entire consecration, and on the fact that he was sealed and sent into the world to do the Father's will, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>.) "Thou art sent on the highest mission. Thou canst accomplish all that thou hast told us; we have come to believe it, and we do know it. We cannot leave thee. We are not looking for temporal honours or Messianic splendours, but for the food that endureth unto everlasting life." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:66-71 When we admit into our minds hard thoughts of the words and works of Jesus, we enter into temptation, which, if the Lord in mercy prevent not, will end in drawing back. The corrupt and wicked heart of man often makes that an occasion for offence, which is matter of the greatest comfort. Our Lord had, in the foregoing discourse, promised eternal life to his followers; the disciples fastened on that plain saying, and resolved to cleave to him, when others fastened on hard sayings, and forsook him. Christ's doctrine is the word of eternal life, therefore we must live and die by it. If we forsake Christ, we forsake our own mercies. They believed that this Jesus was the Messiah promised to their fathers, the Son of the living God. When we are tempted to backslide or turn away, it is good to remember first principles, and to keep to them. And let us ever remember our Lord's searching question; Shall we go away and forsake our Redeemer? To whom can we go? He alone can give salvation by the forgiveness of sins. And this alone brings confidence, comfort, and joy, and bids fear and despondency flee away. It gains the only solid happiness in this world, and opens a way to the happiness of the next.</body></html>
