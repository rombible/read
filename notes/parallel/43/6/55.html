It is an answer, too, to the question. How can this Man give us His flesh to eat? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-52.htm" title="The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?">John 6:52</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - A new justification is given for this great statement: <span class="cmt_word">For my flesh is</span> <span class="cmt_word">true</span> <span class="cmt_word">food, and my blood is</span> <span class="cmt_word">true</span> <span class="cmt_word">drink</span>. (The two <span class="accented">active</span> verbals are adopted, "eating," "drinking;" but <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> are used very frequently by the Attic writers for "food" and "drink<span class="accented"></span>," as well as for the processes of eating and drinking.) That is, Christ's flesh and blood stand in the same relation to the true life of man that food and drink do to the physical life of earth; and so, unless we duly and fully assimilate Divine humanity, we have no life in us. If we cannot assimilate food, we die. It must become part of our life blood and permeate our system; so "the coming and believing" must mean such an acceptance of the Christ that the love of God penetrates our whole being, "even the joints and marrow of soul and spirit;" unless it does so, we have no life in us. Lange, even here, presses the idea of the flesh and blood of Christ as being true food, seeing that by <span class="accented">believing historic</span> contemplation we participate in the "historic form of his manifestation," and by <span class="accented">spiritual</span> contemplation and <span class="accented">fervent faith</span> we drink in the blood which is the life. The difference between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> is nearly that between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The former is the antithesis of the merely apparent food; the latter would have meant genuine food answering to the ideal of food. "The true food" is the food for the inner man - food <span class="accented">in all reality</span>. The Lord was speaking to them of a unique relation which he sustained to the human race, and which cannot be explained away into some mere euphemism for the blessedness and stimulating character of the gospel message. This is made still more evident by his next words - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:52-59 The flesh and blood of the Son of man, denote the Redeemer in the nature of man; Christ and him crucified, and the redemption wrought out by him, with all the precious benefits of redemption; pardon of sin, acceptance with God, the way to the throne of grace, the promises of the covenant, and eternal life. These are called the flesh and blood of Christ, because they are purchased by the breaking his body, and the shedding of his blood. Also, because they are meat and drink to our souls. Eating this flesh and drinking this blood mean believing in Christ. We partake of Christ and his benefits by faith. The soul that rightly knows its state and wants, finds whatever can calm the conscience, and promote true holiness, in the redeemer, God manifest in the flesh. Meditating upon the cross of Christ gives life to our repentance, love, and gratitude. We live by him, as our bodies live by our food. We live by him, as the members by the head, the branches by the root: because he lives we shall live also.</body></html>
