Christ began by speaking of himself as the Bread of God, as the life-giving Bread, as the living Bread of human souls. He made it then clear that he was this by reason of his Divine humanity given for the life of the world. He added to this that he was specially to be appropriated and accepted as a sacrifice, as the death sacrifice, involved in his giving his flesh for the life of the world. The power conferred by his death in life and life in death for man, enabled him to institute eternal life-giving relations between himself and those who entirely accept and make their own this central reality. And now, to meet the nascent objection as to the unique grandeur of his position, he adds: <span class="cmt_word">As the living Father sent me.</span> The phrase, "living Father," occurs nowhere else (cf. "righteous Father," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>; "holy Father," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>; "the living God," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>; and above all, ch. 5:26, "As the Father hath life in himself, so he gave also to the Son to have life in himself"). Christ is speaking of the human position he assumed before them as <span class="accented">sent</span> by the Father who has life in himself, who is more than all his laws or all his works. Not merely as the Word, but as the Word of the living Father made flesh, he stands before them. <span class="cmt_word">And I live because of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father.</span> "Because he lives, I live; my life is guaranteed by his." This is the premiss, the platform on which he now stands (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> must not be confounded with <span class="accented">per Patrem</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as M"Leod Campbell, who, in his interesting discussion on "Christ the Bread of Life," made this expression equivalent to the means and condition of the Saviour's life). From this premiss the Lord argues a corresponding relation of the believer to himself: <span class="cmt_word">So he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me.</span> The points of comparison are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Father's life-imparting relation to Christ, and Christ's life-imparting relation to the believer. In both cases the life of one is the guarantee of the life of the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sending of Christ by the Father, correlated with the eating of Christ by the believer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The peculiar relation of the believer to Christ. "He that eateth me" gathers up and really comprehends all that has gone before. It is, then, possible for the believer not only to share in the Divine humanity by his faith, and also in the fulness and significance of iris (blood) death, but to have full possession of his Divine <span class="accented">personality</span>. "He that eateth me shall live because of me" (cf. "Because I live, ye shall live also," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>). This is the vindication of the previous verse, and the climax of the argument. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:52-59 The flesh and blood of the Son of man, denote the Redeemer in the nature of man; Christ and him crucified, and the redemption wrought out by him, with all the precious benefits of redemption; pardon of sin, acceptance with God, the way to the throne of grace, the promises of the covenant, and eternal life. These are called the flesh and blood of Christ, because they are purchased by the breaking his body, and the shedding of his blood. Also, because they are meat and drink to our souls. Eating this flesh and drinking this blood mean believing in Christ. We partake of Christ and his benefits by faith. The soul that rightly knows its state and wants, finds whatever can calm the conscience, and promote true holiness, in the redeemer, God manifest in the flesh. Meditating upon the cross of Christ gives life to our repentance, love, and gratitude. We live by him, as our bodies live by our food. We live by him, as the members by the head, the branches by the root: because he lives we shall live also.</body></html>
