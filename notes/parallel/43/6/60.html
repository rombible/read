The synoptists tell us of much labour already done in this neighbourhood, and a considerable harvest of souls reaped, so far as a general acknowledgement of his claims and an expectation that he was the Messiah was involved: <span class="cmt_word">When they heard it</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the entire instruction given in open synagogue), <span class="cmt_word">said, This is a hard saying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> cannot or need not be confined to any one of these <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, but may easily embrace them all). The discourse was <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, harsh, the opposite of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, a word used by the unprofitable servant of his master (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-24.htm">Matthew 25:24</a>). It does not mean "hard to be understood," but difficult to accept or be content with. Luthardt here reiterates his conviction that there is no reference in it to the death of Christ, and that the disciples were simply unwilling to accept the idea of his supreme claims and his constant return to the. eating and drinking of his flesh and blood and identification of this eternal life with participation in his corporality. But surely Meyer and Wcstcott, etc., are far nearer to the truth in referring the expression to their unwillingness to accept the bloody death of their Messiah, or to entrust themselves to a Divine Personality whose most distinctive act would be his sacrifice. This was the gross and terrible offence which made the cross a stumbling block to the Jew (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-2.htm">Matthew 16:2</a>l, etc.). Who is able to listen to him? This seems not only to be the possible, but most probable, translation of the genitive with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>. It was the language, not of "the Jews," but of "the disciples." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:60-65 The human nature of Christ had not before been in heaven, but being God and man, that wondrous Person was truly said to have come down from heaven. The Messiah's kingdom was not of this world; and they were to understand by faith, what he had said of a spiritual living upon him, and his fulness. As without the soul of man the flesh is of no value, so without the quickening Spirit of God all forms of religion are dead and worthless. He who made this provision for our souls, alone can teach us these things, and draw us unto Christ, that we may live by faith in him. Let us apply to Christ, thankful that it is declared that every one who is willing to come unto him shall be made welcome.</body></html>
