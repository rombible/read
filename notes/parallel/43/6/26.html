They regarded the whole matter from without. It was to them nothing more than an eating yesterday, which may be repeated to-day; or it may be He will allow them to take Him and make Him King now, though He did not then.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-36.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">An offer of himself as veritable bread</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he met by response their question, but not after the fashion their curiosity might dictate, omitting any reply to their unnecessary inquiry, and even refusing to answer it. The method and time were of no real moment to his questioners. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily,</span> <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs</span> - in the sense I am desirous you should see those miracles of healing (ver. 2) or other wonders of yesterday, viz. as "signs," "symbols," of my higher nature or of my Divine commission. The first group of healings drew some of you to my side, not for my word, but for more healing; and though some others of you who ate off the bread said (ver. 14), "This is the promised Prophet that is coming into the world," you did not get beyond the outward seeming, the superficial phenomenon, you revealed by thus rushing to the couclusion that I was your Prophet and King, that you did not really discern the sign I gave, and ye are seeking me now, not because you have really seen "signs" - <span class="cmt_word">but</span> <span class="cmt_word">because ye ate of the</span> (those) <span class="cmt_word">loaves, and were filled up</span> by this temporary supply of your daily want, expecting today some new, some more impressive, characteristic of the Messianic kingdom than yesterday. You are fastening on the outward, acting on the mere physical resources which you suppose me to possess.

The utmost earnestness should be employed in seeking salvation, in the use of appointed means; yet it is to be sought only as the gift of the Son of man. Him the Father has sealed, proved to be God. He declared the Son of man to be the Son of God with power.</body></html>
