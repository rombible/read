Go away? The faith which first burned in their hearts has passed into the calm certainty of settled knowledge.<p><span class= "bld">Thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God,</span> has found its way into this place from the confession of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-16.htm" title="And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.">Matthew 16:16</a>. The almost certain reading here is, <span class= "ital">Thou art the Holy One of God.</span> They had heard this title ascribed to Him by beings from the spirit world (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.">Mark 1:24</a>), and it has been, perhaps, suggested by the present discourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-46.htm" title="Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.">John 6:46</a>). Like the title Messiah, or Christ, it marks out the consecration to His work. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one.">John 10:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1John 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things said he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;">Revelation 3:7</a>.) The true reading brings out the successive confessions, which are certainly twice, and probably three times, spoken by Peter. This is the second, coming between that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-33.htm" title="Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth you are the Son of God.">Matthew 14:33</a> and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-16.htm" title="And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.">Matthew 16:16</a>. (See Notes at these places.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:66-71 When we admit into our minds hard thoughts of the words and works of Jesus, we enter into temptation, which, if the Lord in mercy prevent not, will end in drawing back. The corrupt and wicked heart of man often makes that an occasion for offence, which is matter of the greatest comfort. Our Lord had, in the foregoing discourse, promised eternal life to his followers; the disciples fastened on that plain saying, and resolved to cleave to him, when others fastened on hard sayings, and forsook him. Christ's doctrine is the word of eternal life, therefore we must live and die by it. If we forsake Christ, we forsake our own mercies. They believed that this Jesus was the Messiah promised to their fathers, the Son of the living God. When we are tempted to backslide or turn away, it is good to remember first principles, and to keep to them. And let us ever remember our Lord's searching question; Shall we go away and forsake our Redeemer? To whom can we go? He alone can give salvation by the forgiveness of sins. And this alone brings confidence, comfort, and joy, and bids fear and despondency flee away. It gains the only solid happiness in this world, and opens a way to the happiness of the next.</body></html>
