They all represent the request coming from the disciples as the first step. St. John does not say it was not so They represent what took place as seen from the outer circle; he, from the point of view of those near to his Master. We may think of the group of disciples seated round Him, and of the first-called Andrew and Peter, James and John, and Philip (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) as closer to Him than the others, who come and speak to Him about the multitudes. While the wants of all are present, the wants of the individuals are not absent. There is something in the character of Philip which this occasion may test. To him is the question spoken which may yet have been an answer to their remark. For "saw a great company come," read <span class= "ital">saw that a great multitude cometh.</span> It is the vivid present of the crowd coming. "Whence shall we buy bread . . .?" or rather, <span class= "ital">Whence are we to buy bread?</span> with the best MSS.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore</span>, seated with his disciples on the rising ground in full view of the lake with its shipping and its fringe of villages, and of the gathering crowds of pilgrims to the Passover, <span class="cmt_word">having lifted up his eyes, and having beheld that a great multitude cometh</span> (was coming) <span class="cmt_word">unto him, saith</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-14.htm">Matthew 14:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-11.htm">Luke 9:11</a> show that the miracle which they all, with John, prepare to describe was preceded by a day in which the Lord instructed the multitudes, "had compassion upon them," "taught them many things," "spake to them concerning the kingdom of God," "healed their sick." The first approach of the multitude was the occasion of a suggestion which Jesus made to Philip. The other evangelists record the reopening of the conversation on the same theme, stimulated by the question already put to Philip in the forenoon, and on this occasion originated by the disciples. The company arrived by the head of the lake (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-33.htm">Mark 6:33</a>, "They ran afoot out of all the cities"); and the first compassionate thought is attributed by John to the Lord himself: <span class="cmt_word">Whence are we to</span> <span class="cmt_word">buy</span> (bread) <span class="cmt_word">loaves, that these multitudes may eat?</span> This very question shows the intimate relations between our Lord and his disciples - the touch of nature. The identification of his interests with theirs is in the "we." Why should Philip be selected for the questioning or suggestion? Luthardt argues that it was a part of the needed education of that apostle that he should have been submitted to the searching anxiety. It is indeed added - <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-14 John relates the miracle of feeding the multitude, for its reference to the following discourse. Observe the effect this miracle had upon the people. Even the common Jews expected the Messiah to come into the world, and to be a great Prophet. The Pharisees despised them as not knowing the law; but they knew most of Him who is the end of the law. Yet men may acknowledge Christ as that Prophet, and still turn a deaf ear to him.</body></html>
