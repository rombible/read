The previous verse stated the condition without which they could not have life. This verse declares that they who thus eat and drink possess that life now, and that it is eternal. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-47.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.">John 6:47</a>.) The thought advances, too, from the "ye" of those immediately addressed to the "whoso," which has no limit but the fulfilment of the condition. The word for "eateth" is a stronger word than that before used, meaning literally the act of dividing the food by the teeth; but this meaning is not to be pressed. It is simply the present tense, which describes the process of eating, and is the same word which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-56.htm" title="He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.">John 6:56-58</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>. The sense of the word in the only other place in the New Testament where it occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-38.htm" title="For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,">Matthew 24:38</a>) confirms this.<p><span class= "bld">And I will raise him up at the last day.</span>--The thought of the eternal life, which is the present possession of the spirit in communion with God, leads on once again to the fuller expansion of that life in the final victory over death. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm" title="And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:52-59 The flesh and blood of the Son of man, denote the Redeemer in the nature of man; Christ and him crucified, and the redemption wrought out by him, with all the precious benefits of redemption; pardon of sin, acceptance with God, the way to the throne of grace, the promises of the covenant, and eternal life. These are called the flesh and blood of Christ, because they are purchased by the breaking his body, and the shedding of his blood. Also, because they are meat and drink to our souls. Eating this flesh and drinking this blood mean believing in Christ. We partake of Christ and his benefits by faith. The soul that rightly knows its state and wants, finds whatever can calm the conscience, and promote true holiness, in the redeemer, God manifest in the flesh. Meditating upon the cross of Christ gives life to our repentance, love, and gratitude. We live by him, as our bodies live by our food. We live by him, as the members by the head, the branches by the root: because he lives we shall live also.</body></html>
