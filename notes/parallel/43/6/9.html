All tell of the five loaves and two fishes. John knows that they are barley loaves--the ordinary black bread of the Galilean peasant; and that the loaves and fishes are not the property of the disciples, but of a lad or slave who has followed the crowd, in the hope, it may be, of finding a purchaser for them.<p>The word for "lad" is a diminutive occurring only here (not in the best text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-16.htm" title="But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,">Matthew 11:16</a>), and in many MSS. is accompanied by "one." The word may mean a servant, but it more probably means a child. One lad! What could he bear for so many?<p><span class= "bld">Two small fishes.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">two fishes.</span> This word, too, is rightly regarded as a diminutive, but it is not a diminutive of "fish." The original root means <span class= "ital">to boil;</span> thus the substantive is used, as in Homer, of boiled meat, and then of anything eaten as a relish with bread, and specially of fish. This diminutive is used in the New Testament only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-11.htm" title="And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.">John 6:11</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/21-9.htm" title="As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.">John 21:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-13.htm" title="Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.">John 21:13</a>. A comparison of the passages will make it clear that St. John means by the word the ordinary relish of fish, which formed, with bread, the staple food of the people.<p>The whole force of Andrew's remark, with its diminutive words, rests upon the smallness of their power to help, while Philip had dwelt on the greatness of the need.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-14 John relates the miracle of feeding the multitude, for its reference to the following discourse. Observe the effect this miracle had upon the people. Even the common Jews expected the Messiah to come into the world, and to be a great Prophet. The Pharisees despised them as not knowing the law; but they knew most of Him who is the end of the law. Yet men may acknowledge Christ as that Prophet, and still turn a deaf ear to him.</body></html>
