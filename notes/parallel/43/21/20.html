He had been the companion and friend of St. Peter (comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 371). More than any other--and this is made prominent here--he had entered into close communion with the Lord Himself. He was called the "disciple whom Jesus loved" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>, and <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 375); he had leaned on His breast at supper, and, at a sign from Peter, had asked who was the traitor; he may well think that for him too there was some glimpse into the future, some declaration of what his path should be; or in that mingling of act and thought, of sign and thing signified, which run all through these verses, his following may indicate that he too, though he had never dared to say so, was ready to follow wherever the Master went.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The revelations made to patient waiting for the coming of the Lord, with correction of a misunderstanding touching the disciple whom Jesus loved. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having turned himself round,</span> instead of keeping every glance for his Lord, <span class="cmt_word">Peter seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), obeying the command without offering one suggestion. The writer adds, by way of further identification, <span class="cmt_word">he who also leaned back at the supper, upon his breast, and said, Who is he that betrayeth thee?</span> (see notes on John 13:23). The note is here introduced to show the close connection of Peter and the beloved disciple. It was Simon Peter who had beckoned at the supper to the beloved disciple to ask this very question. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:20-24 Sufferings, pains, and death, will appear formidable even to the experienced Christian; but in the hope to glorify God, to leave a sinful world, and to be present with his Lord, he becomes ready to obey the Redeemer's call, and to follow Him through death to glory. It is the will of Christ that his disciples should mind their own duty, and not be curious about future events, either as to themselves or others. Many things we are apt to be anxious about, which are nothing to us. Other people's affairs are nothing to us, to intermeddle in; we must quietly work, and mind our own business. Many curious questions are put about the counsels of God, and the state of the unseen world, as to which we may say, What is this to us? And if we attend to the duty of following Christ, we shall find neither heart nor time to meddle with that which does not belong to us. How little are any unwritten traditions to be relied upon! Let the Scripture be its own interpreter, and explain itself; as it is, in a great measure, its own evidence, and proves itself, for it is light. See the easy setting right such mistakes by the word of Christ. Scripture language is the safest channel for Scripture truth; the words which the Holy Ghost teaches, 1Co 2:13. Those who cannot agree in the same terms of art, and the application of them, may yet agree in the same Scripture terms, and to love one another.</body></html>
