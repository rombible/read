The third time, to him who had three times denied! and this time the love which Peter knows has ever filled his soul seems to be doubted. The question cuts to the very quick, and in the agony of the heart smarting beneath the wound, he appeals in more emphatic words than before to the all-seeing eye that could read the very inmost secrets of his life, "Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest that I love Thee."<p><span class= "bld">Feed my sheep.</span>--The better reading is, probably, <span class= "ital">little sheep.</span> The difference is of one letter only (<span class= "greekheb">???????</span> and <span class= "greekheb">????????</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and a mistake would therefore be easily made by a copyist. The diminutive word occurs nowhere else in Biblical Greek, and is almost certainly, therefore, part of the original text; but whether it was first written here or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16</a>, or in both, must with our present knowledge be left undetermined. The order of the Received text is "lambs" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm" title="So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.">John 21:15</a>), "sheep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16</a>), "sheep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-17.htm" title="He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Love you me? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:17</a>). The Peshito Syriac must have read "lambs," "little sheep," "sheep"; and this is in part supported by the Vulgate, which has "agnos," "agnos," "oves," and more exactly by the Latin of St. Ambrose, who has "agnos," "oviculas," "oves." This would point to a three-fold gradation answering to the three-fold question, and committing to the Apostle's care the lambs, the little sheep, the sheep of the flock of Christ. Still, it must be admitted that the more probable reading is <span class= "ital">lambs, little sheep, little sheep,</span> and that the difference of thought is in the difference of the verbs. "Feed My lambs; be a shepherd to the weak ones of the flock; feed these weak ones." He who loved Christ is to be like Christ, a good shepherd, giving his life for the sheep who are Christ's. He who had been loved and forgiven, held up that he might not fall, restored after he had fallen, is to be to others what Christ had been to him--feeding men with spiritual truths as they can bear them, gently guiding and caring for those who are as the weak ones of the flock through ignorance, prejudice, waywardness. The chief work of the chief Apostle, and of every true apostle of Christ, is to win back the erring, helpless, sinful sons of men; and the power which fits them for this work is the burning love which quickens all other gifts and graces, and can appeal to the Great Shepherd Himself, "Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest that I love Thee." As a remarkable instance of how the Great Shepherd's words impressed themselves upon the Apostle's mind, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm" title="For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.">1Peter 2:25</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - And now Peter seems to have conquered, by his persistence, the heart of his Lord, and Jesus adopts the very phrase which Peter twice over had substituted for that which he had himself used; for he saith unto him the third time, <span class="cmt_word">Simon, son of Jonas</span> (John), <span class="cmt_word">lovest thou me</span>? (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>;); as if he had said, "Dost thou indeed love me dearly, love me as a friend, love me with the earnestness and fervor that twice over has corrected my word into one more congenial to thee, and more ample and true than that used by myself?" This trait of Peter's character, which John has hinted on several occasions, is abundantly illustrated in the synoptic narrative and in the Acts of the Apostles. <span class="cmt_word">Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me</span>? The grief was natural. The repeated question suggests some doubt about his sincerity, and the adoption of the apostle's own word cut him with a more poignant heart-thrust? He may have thought thus: Jesus seems to distrust the reality of my personal affection. and will not accept my implication that this is more to me than the most thoughtful <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>, the most deeply meditated and measured reverence. He was grieved because a third time seems like an infinite repetition, and, if repeated thus a third time, it may be asked me again and again every day of my life. He was grieved from the irresistible analogy between the threefold denial of which he had been guilty, and this threefold interrogatory. He does not say as before, "Yea, Lord;" but commences, <span class="cmt_word">Lord, thou knowest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">all things</span>. Omniscience is freely conceded to the Lord. All things that Peter did, thought, or felt, all his bewilderment, all his mistakes, all his impulsiveness and mixture of motive, all his self-assertion, all his weakness and disloyalty, are known; but so also all the inner springs and lines of his nobler nature, and that though he played the fool, he was a hypocrite in his denials. The Lord knew that his faith did not really fail, though his courage did; and in virtue of this breadth of the Lord's knowing, he must have come to full cognizance of the entire meaning of Peter's life. <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> (<span class="cmt_word">seest</span>) <span class="cmt_word">hast come fully to know that I love thee!</span> Just because thou intuitively knowest all things. The play on <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is obvious (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to him, Feed my little sheep</span>. It is said by some that, even if this be the true reading, we have simply a renewal of the tenderness and strong emotion which led the Lord to speak of the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> on the first occasion. Doubtless deep and glowing affection pervades the use of these epithets; but if this be the sole explanation, then the reason of the adoption of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in the second commission is not evident, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> would have answered the purpose. There is distinct progress in the ideas: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Feed my lambs;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Rule (shepherd) my sheep;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Feed my little sheep." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>First, let Peter, let the apostolic company, let any one of the successors of the apostles, learn the delicate duty of supplying the just and appropriate nourishment to those that are young in years or in graces; then let him also learn to guide, direct, protect from outward foes, the mature disciples, and preserve the discipline of the flock, seeking the lost sheep until it be found; and he will find that then a third duty emerges. The sheep that are young in heart, the old men that are childlike in spirit, the trembling sheep that need even more care than the lambs themselves, are specially thrown upon the shepherd's care. Was not Peter himself a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>? Had he not shown that he was a most imperfect master of himself? He was mature in years, but childish as well as childlike in character. He could (for a while) only see one thing at a time, and he was impatient of the future. Mark welt his characteristic words, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man. O Lord!" "That be far from thee, O Lord!" "Why cannot I follow thee now?" "Thou shall never wash my feet!" "Not my feet only, but my hands and my head!" "Let us build for thee three tabernacles!" "Not so; I have never eaten anything common or unclean!" These are familiar illustrations of the childishness and infantile simplicity, babyish audacity, of the old disciple. Even after the Lord has risen from the dead, Peter ventures to correct his language. Christ, moreover, accepts his persistent alteration of the word for "love" item the lips of this <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Thus the Lord summons him to undertake a duty which he would on reflection be specially able to appreciate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:15-19 Our Lord addressed Peter by his original name, as if he had forfeited that of Peter through his denying him. He now answered, Thou knowest that I love thee; but without professing to love Jesus more than others. We must not be surprised to have our sincerity called into question, when we ourselves have done that which makes it doubtful. Every remembrance of past sins, even pardoned sins, renews the sorrow of a true penitent. Conscious of integrity, Peter solemnly appealed to Christ, as knowing all things, even the secrets of his heart. It is well when our falls and mistakes make us more humble and watchful. The sincerity of our love to God must be brought to the test; and it behoves us to inquire with earnest, preserving prayer to the heart-searching God, to examine and prove us, whether we are able to stand this test. No one can be qualified to feed the sheep and lambs of Christ, who does not love the good Shepherd more than any earthly advantage or object. It is the great concern of every good man, whatever death he dies, to glorify God in it; for what is our chief end but this, to die to the Lord, at the word of the Lord?</body></html>
