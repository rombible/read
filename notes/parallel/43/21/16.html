Here our Lord omits, as Peter had done, the "more than these," but he again, with perhaps deeper meaning, uses the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. Dost thou render me even more in one sense, though less in another, of thy heart's reverence? Dost thou treat me with the confidence and esteem, submission and admiration, which are my due? Again Peter, with his heart bursting with personal affection, feels that he can and must say, <span class="cmt_word">Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> ere; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> love thee dearly). The commission that follows is the second stage of pastoral office. <span class="cmt_word">He saith to him, Tend</span> ("act the part of shepherd") <span class="cmt_word">my sheep</span>. Christ is the "good Shepherd," and, as Peter puts it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>, the "chief Shepherd." He has laid down his life with a view of taking it again, and ever after discharging the functions of the Shepherd. He means to bring all the "sheep" into one flock. They shall all hear his voice, and receive from him everlasting life. Meanwhile the leader of the apostles is made to appreciate that love is the condition of all healthy guidance. Faculty for rule is part of the very nature of the pastoral care. The sheep will need this even more than the "lambs;" the old disciples will require, even more than the young converts, both direction and command In this respect the subsequent career of Peter was more conspicuous than that of the rest of the apostles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a> for the use of the word). But the shepherding of the sheep is an essentially necessary and integral portion of every pastor's care. When assailed by the wolf of heresy, by the hostile marauder, by new conditions of any kind, by special danger, unless he can in self-forgetting love pilot and protect his flock, he is no true shepherd. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:15-19 Our Lord addressed Peter by his original name, as if he had forfeited that of Peter through his denying him. He now answered, Thou knowest that I love thee; but without professing to love Jesus more than others. We must not be surprised to have our sincerity called into question, when we ourselves have done that which makes it doubtful. Every remembrance of past sins, even pardoned sins, renews the sorrow of a true penitent. Conscious of integrity, Peter solemnly appealed to Christ, as knowing all things, even the secrets of his heart. It is well when our falls and mistakes make us more humble and watchful. The sincerity of our love to God must be brought to the test; and it behoves us to inquire with earnest, preserving prayer to the heart-searching God, to examine and prove us, whether we are able to stand this test. No one can be qualified to feed the sheep and lambs of Christ, who does not love the good Shepherd more than any earthly advantage or object. It is the great concern of every good man, whatever death he dies, to glorify God in it; for what is our chief end but this, to die to the Lord, at the word of the Lord?</body></html>
