(Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>.) The remainder of the verse contains three pairs of sentences answering to each other:--<p>"Thou wast young,". . . . "Thou shalt be old;"<p>"Thou girdedst thyself,". . . . "Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee;"<p>"And walkedst whither thou wouldest," . . . "And carry thee whither thou wouldest not."<p><span class= "bld">Thou wast young.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">thou wast younger</span> (than thou art now). Peter must have been at this time (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-14.htm" title="And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.">Matthew 8:14</a>) in middle age.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee.</span>--Do these words refer to the crucifixion of Peter? Tradition, from Tertullian downwards (<span class= "ital">Scorp.</span> xv.; <span class= "ital">De Praescr.</span> xxxv.), states that he was crucified, and, interpreting this prophecy by the event, asserts that they do. Tertullian himself so understood them, for he says, "Then is Peter girded by another when he is bound to the cross."<p>But on the other hand, (1) the girding (with chains) would precede, not follow, the crucifixion; (2) it would be more natural to speak of another stretching forth his hands if the nailing them to the cross is intended; (3) the last clause, "carry thee whither thou wouldest not," could not follow the stretching of the hands on the transverse beam of the cross.<p>It seems impossible therefore to adopt the traditional reference to crucifixion, and we must take the words, "stretch forth thy hands," as expressing symbolically the personal surrender previous to being girded by another. To what exact form of death the context does not specify. We have thus in the second pair of sentences, as in the first and third, a complete parallelism, the stretching forth of the hands being a part of the girding by another, and the whole being in contrast to "Thou girdedst thyself."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto thee</span>. This form of address links the pre-resurrection life to that which follows, proclaims the identity of the being and the unity of the Person of the Christ under new conditions. More than that, much solemnity is conferred on this final word of the Master. <span class="cmt_word">When thou wast younger than thou art now</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before thou camest under my sway; when thou wert supreme ruler of the fishing-fleet of Capernaum, with wife and family dependent on thee; when Andrew, James, and John (thy partners) were in a measure all doing thy will, following in thy train, submitting to thy behests, - <span class="cmt_word">thou girdodst thyself</span> for whatever task was set before thee; thou hadst the choice of duties and pleasures; thou hadst time at thy disposal, thy method of service in thine own hands, even as now it was thy will to gird thee for the task of swimming to my feet (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-17.htm">Proverbs 31:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4, 5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-8.htm">Luke 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The simple verb is used here in reference to all kinds of "girding"). So that the Lord reminds him of his natural self-will, so conspicuous and prominent, the secret of all his weakness and much of his individuality. <span class="cmt_word">And thou walkedst whither thou wouldest</span>; or literally, thou wert in the habit of walking whithersoever thou weft willing or desiring to do; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thine outward conduct, and the whole line of thy daily enterprise and duty, was not only an utterance of thine own self-mastery, but even thy wishes, the momentary waywardness of thy purposes, found immediate gratification. But a great change has come over thee; thou hast passed through a new experience. Already thou feelest that thou art not thine own; thy heart and strength, thy hands, thy feet, thy very girdle and sandal, are beginning to seem to thee no longer at thine own disposal. Thy self-will is checked, thy natural audacity and power of initiation are repressed into much narrower limits. Thou-hast found thyself weaker than a little child; thou art in need of this Divine principle of "love," deep and fervent, reverential as well as personal, not only to utter bold expressions of regard, but to form the very focus and new central force of thy whole being; and so it will come to pass that this new force will more than master thee; and <span class="cmt_word">when thou shalt be</span> old and gray with years, thy service to that other and higher wilt shall be complete: thou <span class="cmt_word">wilt stretch forth thy hands</span> in token of entire submission to the will of another, however it may be revealed to thee - whether at the instance of "the angel" or "Herod," of "Cornelius" or Nero's executioner! This remarkable phrase has often been supposed to mean the "stretching forth of the hands of the crucified" on his being appended to the cross. But such a process would follow rather than precede the "girding," which is, on such an interpretation, taken literally of the girding that preceded the nailing. There can be no doubt, from the language of St. John, that this was the final and forcible illustration of the new principle that would take full possession of Simon Peter. But meanwhile it was a long life of willing surrender to the Supreme Will which gives its highest meaning to these words. <span class="cmt_word">And another shall gird thee, and carry thee</span>(or, bring thee) <span class="cmt_word">whither thou art not wishing to go</span>. The old self-will, though it be indeed mastered, will not have utterly vanished. If it be not so, where would be the sacrifice? Even the blessed Lord himself said, "Not my will, but thine be done." Verily, even the sanctified nature of the sinless Man, prepared in the spotless womb of the blessed Virgin by the Holy Ghost, anointed by the Spirit, and in living absolute union with the only begotten Son, - even he was, in human consciousness, disposed to cry, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me," etc. We need not wonder, then, that to the very last, when the supreme will was manifested to Peter in the approaches of violent death, he should feel the will of the flesh thwarted. The exquisite legend embodied in the "Domiue, quo vadis?" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>) confirms the entire representation of the character of Peter. So also does the story, preserved by Tertullian ('De Pries.,' 35; ' Ad Scorp.,' 15) and Eusebius ('Hist. Eccl.,' 3:1), that the apostle preferred crucifixion with his head downwards, on the plea that to be crucified as his Master was too great an honor for one that had denied his Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:15-19 Our Lord addressed Peter by his original name, as if he had forfeited that of Peter through his denying him. He now answered, Thou knowest that I love thee; but without professing to love Jesus more than others. We must not be surprised to have our sincerity called into question, when we ourselves have done that which makes it doubtful. Every remembrance of past sins, even pardoned sins, renews the sorrow of a true penitent. Conscious of integrity, Peter solemnly appealed to Christ, as knowing all things, even the secrets of his heart. It is well when our falls and mistakes make us more humble and watchful. The sincerity of our love to God must be brought to the test; and it behoves us to inquire with earnest, preserving prayer to the heart-searching God, to examine and prove us, whether we are able to stand this test. No one can be qualified to feed the sheep and lambs of Christ, who does not love the good Shepherd more than any earthly advantage or object. It is the great concern of every good man, whatever death he dies, to glorify God in it; for what is our chief end but this, to die to the Lord, at the word of the Lord?</body></html>
