It is a word which, indeed, may express His love for them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-49.htm" title="The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.">John 4:49</a>), but which appears also to have been used as an address to workmen or inferiors, not unlike our own words "boys" or "lads." They seem to take it in this sense, as though some traveller passing by asked the question because he wished to purchase some of their fish.<p>The word rendered "meat" occurs here only in the New Testament. It means anything eaten with bread, and was used as equivalent to the fish which was the ordinary relish. (Comp.

The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> suggests a negative answer. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is that which is eaten with bread, and is commonly <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, something roasted for the purpose of eating with bread. Since fish was very frequently used for the purpose, the word was often used for "fish" itself (LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-22.htm">Numbers 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.9, 11. Other equivalent words are found in Attic Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Children</span> (lads, young men yonder), <span class="cmt_word">you have nothing, I suppose, to eat? They answered him, No</span>. In all this scene the risen Lord showed himself interested and co-operating with them in their daily toil, as engaged in the same work with them. Their listless manner showed that they had toiled in vain, and, perhaps with tone or gesture of unwillingness to confess their failure, they replied in the negative. <span class="cmt_word">Then he said</span> <span class="cmt_word">to them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship</span>; the side opposite to that on which they were dragging it along. Moreover, the "right hand," the "right eye," the "right ear," the "right side," are proverbially the more useful, fruitful, or honorable. The imagery is preserved throughout Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall find.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they cast</span> <span class="accented">it<span class="cmt_word"></span>.</span> And in order to do this they would probably have had to haul a considerable portion of it into the boat for the necessary transference from left to right. They at once obeyed the summons, remembering what they had previously found to have been their experience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5.htm">Luke 5</a>.), <span class="cmt_word">and no longer were they able</span>, or had they strength, to draw it into the boat. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is here quite a different process from the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 8, which describes the hauling, tugging, of the net to shore. The difficulty arose <span class="cmt_word">from</span> (or, <span class="accented">because of</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the multitude of the fishes</span>. The miracle here is a simple indication of the higher knowledge which the Lord possessed. This huge shoal may, humanly speaking, have been perceived in its approach; so that the event is more impressive in its analogical force than in its supernatural machinery. It suggests the surprising results that would accompany their labor when they should under the Lord's own injunction and inspiration, become veritable fishers of men. The parabolic teaching of this miracle is unusually obvious. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-14 Christ makes himself known to his people, usually in his ordinances; but sometimes by his Spirit he visits them when employed in their business. It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together in common conversation, and common business. The hour for their entering upon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, and not be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to his people, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants of his people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, and those are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who are humble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed, shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observing Christ's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship. Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which none else can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take care that those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. And latter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, It is the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in his sufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, and reached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, and what difference there may be between some believers and others in the way of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him! Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore, and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in their places, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus had provision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whence this came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples. Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none, nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes, yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.</body></html>
