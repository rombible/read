The traits of character which have before met us are exactly preserved here. John, true to the life of contemplation, is first to trace in the present draught of fishes an analogy with the earlier one, and to discern that the Master who spoke then is present now. Peter, true to the life of action, is first to rush into that Master's presence when he is told that it is the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">He girt his fisher's coat unto him (for he was naked).</span>--That is, as the words in the original clearly imply, he put on, and girded round his body the garment which workmen customarily used. This seems to have been a kind of linen frock worn over the shirt, and the Talmud has adopted the Greek word here used to express it. The word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and the rendering "fisher's coat" probably gives a correct idea of what is meant.<p>The common usage of the Greek and Hebrew words answering to the English word "naked," makes it probable that St. Peter was wearing some under-garment, and that reverence for the Lord, into whose presence he is about to go, led him to add to this the outer frock. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>, as a distinct consequence of the vivid reminiscence of the past; with sudden intuition given to him by the event, and a fresh realization of the identity of the risen Lord with the Master Jesus, <span class="cmt_word">that disciple therefore whom Jesus loved</span> - who must have been either one of the sons of Zebedee or one of the two unnamed disciples. The latter supposition is inapposite from the intimacy between Peter and John, which the synoptic narrative, and references in the Acts and Galatians it., have recorded; that disciple and no other, the one so often referred to, one of the seven, <span class="cmt_word">saith unto Peter, It is the Lord</span>. Had he not again and again done wondrous things of power, wisdom, and love on this very spot, in these very waters? So John comes intuitively and with true insight to the sacred truth and reality, and his conduct is again contrasted wonderfully with the energetic and impulsive Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5, 6</a>). The same relative characteristics of the two apostles have been preserved throughout the fivefold narrative. Such a contrast so delicately and persistently sustained lends certainty to the objective reality. <span class="cmt_word">Accordingly Simon Peter, when he heard, It is the Lord</span> - for the words flashed conviction into him - hurried at once to put his new idea to practical proof. The word of John satisfied him, and, not seeing for himself what John saw with mental eye, he accepted the joyful news, and was the first to spring into the sea, and, with his usual energy, to cast himself at his Master's feet. <span class="cmt_word">He girt his coat about him</span> (<span class="cmt_word">for he was naked</span>). The word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> does not mean perfectly nude. A man who had simply the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> or tunic upon him was practically thus regarded. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> in the same sense. The proper name for the tunic, or garment next the skin, was <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and that which was put over the tunic was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (Meyer and Wettstein, in loc.). The Talmud has Aramaized the word, calling it <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span> (ependetha), and used it for the workman's frock or blouse, often without sleeves, and fastened with a girdle. Dr. Salmond truly says that this reference to an act which to ordinary men would have suggested a different arrangement of dress, reveals the eye-witness. Hengstenberg suggests that Peter simply girded his upper garment for the purpose of swimming more easily; but, as Luthardt observes, with this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> already upon him, he would not have been "naked" <span class="cmt_word">And he cast himself into the sea</span>, intending, whatever might be the fate of the laden net, to be the first to greet and worship the Lord. Of the reception he met with John says nothing: he knew nothing. The Lord had some special instruction for him a little later. It is not in harmony with the words, as Gerhard supposed, that Peter walked triumphantly upon the waters. Not a hint of it occurs. The hundred yards were rapidly covered, either by swimming or wading to the shore meanwhile. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-14 Christ makes himself known to his people, usually in his ordinances; but sometimes by his Spirit he visits them when employed in their business. It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together in common conversation, and common business. The hour for their entering upon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, and not be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to his people, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants of his people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, and those are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who are humble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed, shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observing Christ's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship. Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which none else can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take care that those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. And latter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, It is the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in his sufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, and reached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, and what difference there may be between some believers and others in the way of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him! Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore, and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in their places, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus had provision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whence this came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples. Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none, nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes, yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.</body></html>
