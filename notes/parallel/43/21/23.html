They took as a statement what had been said as a supposition, and understood it in the then current belief that the Second Advent would come in their own generation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1Thessalonians 4:17</a>.)<p>The mistake and its correction are both interesting in their bearing upon the date of the Gospel, and they furnish that kind of evidence which is perfectly natural as a growth, but which cannot possibly be made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - We need not be surprised that the sublime meaning of these words, "Wait while I am ever coming to him," should have been misunderstood. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore this word went forth to the brethren.</span> The designation, "brethren," only occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>. The more familiar names of "disciples" and "children," "servants" and "apostles," are used in the Gospels. The Acts and Epistles introduce a new group of titles, e.g. "believers" as well as "brethren," "saints" as well as "disciples," "Christians," "slaves and soldiers of Christ," "sons of God," "priests and kings," and "little children;" but now, acting on the Divine hint of the Lord's own words, John speaks of his fellow-disciples who are called into the sacred fellowship as "brethren." The word went forth that that disciple dieth not (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "the disciple whom Jesus loved"). This was not an unnatural supposition, as his age advanced, and he was regarded as the "great light of Asia," the depositary of the latest traditions, as the link between the days of our Lord's ministry and two succeeding generations of believers, the seer of mighty visions, the enemy of all unrighteousness, and the apostle of love to the lost. In virtue of this very tradition, three hundred years later it was said that the holy apostle was still sleeping in his tomb at Ephesus, and that the dust moved lightly on his heaving breast (Augustine, 'Tr. on John,' 124:2). Here was the beginning of a genuine myth, which, having no real root in fact, failed to establish itself. "John the Baptist is risen from the dead," exclaimed Herod Antipas, "and therefore mighty powers energize in him." But there was no life and no truth in the story, and even among the disciples of St. John Baptist it did not take any place as a supposed fact. It is interesting to see that here a myth was started without positively bad faith, and based itself upon a recorded saying of the Lord; but it perished! The aged apostle strikes the folly dead with one stroke of his pen. The language is remarkable, as helping to prove that John wrote this chapter as well as the rest of the Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Yet</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said not unto him, that he dieth not; but, If I will that he abide while I am ever coming, what is that to thee</span>? Meyer, who always insists on the apostolic idea of the nearness of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, thinks that John does not decide here whether the rumor was true or false, and simply says it must, when he wrote, have been left still uncertain and unsettled (so Luther). The tradition is not authoritatively condemned; but it is shown to be a mere inference, one inference out of many, from words partially understood. The Epistles of John show how deeply John pondered the idea, and how much he crowded into the words, "abide in him," until the coming, and before and during and after the various comings of the Lord to him. Mr. Browning, in 'A Death in the Desert,' makes St. John say in his last hours - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"If I live yet, it is for good, more love<br />Through me to men: be naught but ashes here<br />That keep awhile my semblance, who was John -<br />Still when they scatter, there is left on earth."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">No one alive who knew (consider this!) -<br />Saw with his eyes and handled with his hands<br />That which was from the first, the Word of life.<br />How will it be when none more saith, 'I saw '?<br />Such ever was love's way: to rise, it stoops.<br />Since I, whom Christ's mouth taught, was bidden teach,<br />I went, for many years, about the world,<br />Saying, 'It was so; so I heard and saw,'?<br />Speaking as the ease asked: and men believed.</span> * * * <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"To me that story - ay, that Life and Death<br />Of which I wrote 'it was' - to me it is; -<br />Is, here and now: I apprehend naught else.<br />Yea, and the Resurrection and Uprise<br />To the right hand of the throne -...<br />I saw the Power; I see the Love, once weak,<br />Resume the Power; and in this word 'I see'<br />Lo, there is recognized the Spirit of both<br />That moving o'er the spirit of man, unblinds<br />His eye and bids him look....<br />Then stand before that fact, that Life and Death,<br />Stay there at gaze, till it dispart, dispread,<br />As though a star should open out, all sides,<br />Grow the world on you, as it is my world."</span> In ver. 23 we find the significant close of the Fourth Gospel, and there is much to make it highly probable that the two remaining verses were added by the Ephesian elders, as their certificate of its authorship, and their identification of the beloved disciple with the author of the Gospel. It differs from the similar passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>, where the writer himself gives his own autoptic testimony to the great miracle of the spear-thrust; and where that testimony is declared by himself to be <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, "veritable," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> answering to the very idea of testimony. Here the person and verb are plural. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:20-24 Sufferings, pains, and death, will appear formidable even to the experienced Christian; but in the hope to glorify God, to leave a sinful world, and to be present with his Lord, he becomes ready to obey the Redeemer's call, and to follow Him through death to glory. It is the will of Christ that his disciples should mind their own duty, and not be curious about future events, either as to themselves or others. Many things we are apt to be anxious about, which are nothing to us. Other people's affairs are nothing to us, to intermeddle in; we must quietly work, and mind our own business. Many curious questions are put about the counsels of God, and the state of the unseen world, as to which we may say, What is this to us? And if we attend to the duty of following Christ, we shall find neither heart nor time to meddle with that which does not belong to us. How little are any unwritten traditions to be relied upon! Let the Scripture be its own interpreter, and explain itself; as it is, in a great measure, its own evidence, and proves itself, for it is light. See the easy setting right such mistakes by the word of Christ. Scripture language is the safest channel for Scripture truth; the words which the Holy Ghost teaches, 1Co 2:13. Those who cannot agree in the same terms of art, and the application of them, may yet agree in the same Scripture terms, and to love one another.</body></html>
