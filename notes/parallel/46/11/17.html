There were evidently three great abuses which had crept into the Church:--1. The discarding by the women of the covering for their heads. This only concerned one sex, and has been treated of in the earlier part of this chapter. The other two affect both sexes. 2. The disorders at the Lord's Supper. 3. The misuse of spiritual gifts. The former of these occupies the remainder of this chapter, while the latter is discussed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1Corinthians 12:1-30</a>. To render the Greek word "I declare," as in the Authorised version, and so make it refer to what is about to follow, gives a more logical completeness to the passage, but it is scarcely allowable, as the Greek word elsewhere always means a distinct command (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1Thessalonians 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2Thessalonians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.">2Thessalonians 3:12</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Others have suggested that St. Paul anticipates in thought the practical direction which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-34.htm" title="And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you come not together to condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.">1Corinthians 11:34</a>, and alludes to it here in the words, "This I command you." This view is open to the objections (1) that it completely isolates <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.">1Corinthians 11:17</a> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-16.htm" title="But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.">1Corinthians 11:16</a>, while the Greek evidently intimates a connection between them; (2) that it is unnatural to separate the statement so far from the command to which it refers. It is better to regard these words as given above--forming a sort of intellectual isthmus connecting the two wide fields of thought which the earlier and later portions of the chapter embrace.<p><span class= "bld">I praise you not.</span>--This carries the thought back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.">1Corinthians 11:2</a>, and shows that the commendation expressed there is still the writer's starting-point, or rather the point of departure from which he proceeds to censure.<p><span class= "bld">That ye come together.</span>--Although in the English version the word "you" is inserted ("I praise <span class= "ital">you</span> not"), it does not occur in the Greek. The passage is not, "I do not praise you because, &c.," but, "I do not praise your coming together not for the better, but for the worse." These words introduce the new topic which follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-34.</span> - <span class="accented">Discreditable</span> <span class="accented">irregularities at the Eucharist and the agapae.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">But in giving you this charge, I praise you not.</span> A reference to the "I praise you" of ver. 2. <span class="cmt_word">Ye come together.</span> As he advances, his rebukes become more and more serious; for the present reproach does not affect a few, but the Church assembly in general. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:17-22 The apostle rebukes the disorders in their partaking of the Lord's supper. The ordinances of Christ, if they do not make us better, will be apt to make us worse. If the use of them does not mend, it will harden. Upon coming together, they fell into divisions, schisms. Christians may separate from each other's communion, yet be charitable one towards another; they may continue in the same communion, yet be uncharitable. This last is schism, rather than the former. There is a careless and irregular eating of the Lord's supper, which adds to guilt. Many rich Corinthians seem to have acted very wrong at the Lord's table, or at the love-feasts, which took place at the same time as the supper. The rich despised the poor, and ate and drank up the provisions they brought, before the poor were allowed to partake; thus some wanted, while others had more than enough. What should have been a bond of mutual love and affection, was made an instrument of discord and disunion. We should be careful that nothing in our behaviour at the Lord's table, appears to make light of that sacred institution. The Lord's supper is not now made an occasion for gluttony or revelling, but is it not often made the support of self-righteous pride, or a cloak for hypocrisy? Let us never rest in the outward forms of worship; but look to our hearts.</body></html>
