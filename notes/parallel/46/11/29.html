The force of the passage is, "He who eats and drinks without discerning the Body (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Church) in that assembly, eats and drinks a judgment to himself; for if we would discern ourselves we should not be judged."<p>There are some important points to be borne in mind regarding this interpretation of the passage. (1) The Greek word, which we render "discerning," "discern," signifies to arrive at a right estimate of the character or quality of a thing. (2) <span class= "ital">The</span> fault which St. Paul was condemning was the practice which the Corinthians had fallen into of regarding these gatherings as opportunities for individual indulgence, and not as Church assemblies. They did not rightly estimate such gatherings as being corporate meetings; they did not rightly estimate themselves as not now isolated individuals, but members of the common Body. They ought to discern in these meetings of the Church a body; they ought to discern in themselves parts of a body. Not only is this interpretation, I venture to think, the most accurate and literal interpretation of the Greek, but it is the only view which seems to me to make the passage bear intelligibly on the point which St. Paul is considering, and the real evil which he seeks to counteract. (3) To refer these words directly or indirectly to the question of a physical presence in the Lord's Supper, is to divorce them violently from their surroundings, and to make them allude to some evil for which the explicit and practical remedy commended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-33.htm" title="Why, my brothers, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another.">1Corinthians 11:33-34</a> would be no remedy at all. Moreover. if the word "body" means the Lord's physical body, surely the word "Lord's" would have been added, and the words, "and the blood," for the non-recognition of the blood would be just as great an offence. (4) St. Paul never uses the word "body" in reference to our Lord's physical body, without some clear indication that such is meant. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>.) On the other hand, the use of the word "Body," or "Body of Christ," meaning the Church, is frequent. We have had it but a few verses before, in reference to this very subject (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1Corinthians 10:16</a>). It is also to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm" title="So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.">Romans 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>. (In this last passage, "of His flesh and of His bones," are not in the best MSS., and destroy the real force of the "Body," which means "Church.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unworthily.</span> The word is not genuine here, being repeated from ver. 27; it is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C. <span class="cmt_word">Eateth and drinketh damnation to himself;</span> rather, <span class="accented">eateth and drinketh judgment to himself</span> There is reason to believe that the word "damnation" once had a much milder meaning in English than that which it now popularly bears. In King James's time it probably did not of necessity mean more than "an unfavourable verdict." Otherwise this would be the most unfortunate mistranslation in the whole Bible. It has probably kept thousands, as it kept Goethe, from Holy Communion. We see from ver. 32 that this "judgment" had a purely merciful and disciplinary character. <span class="cmt_word">Not discerning;</span> rather, <span class="accented">if he discern not</span>, the Lord's body, Any one who approach? the Lord's Supper in a spirit of levity or defiance, not discriminating between it and common food, draws on himself, by so eating and drinking, a judgment which is defined in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:23-34 The apostle describes the sacred ordinance, of which he had the knowledge by revelation from Christ. As to the visible signs, these are the bread and wine. What is eaten is called bread, though at the same time it is said to be the body of the Lord, plainly showing that the apostle did not mean that the bread was changed into flesh. St. Matthew tells us, our Lord bid them all drink of the cup, ch. Mt 26:27, as if he would, by this expression, provide against any believer being deprived of the cup. The things signified by these outward signs, are Christ's body and blood, his body broken, his blood shed, together with all the benefits which flow from his death and sacrifice. Our Saviour's actions were, taking the bread and cup, giving thanks, breaking the bread, and giving both the one and the other. The actions of the communicants were, to take the bread and eat, to take the cup and drink, and to do both in remembrance of Christ. But the outward acts are not the whole, or the principal part, of what is to be done at this holy ordinance. Those who partake of it, are to take him as their Lord and Life, yield themselves up to him, and live upon him. Here is an account of the ends of this ordinance. It is to be done in remembrance of Christ, to keep fresh in our minds his dying for us, as well as to remember Christ pleading for us, in virtue of his death, at God's right hand. It is not merely in remembrance of Christ, of what he has done and suffered; but to celebrate his grace in our redemption. We declare his death to be our life, the spring of all our comforts and hopes. And we glory in such a declaration; we show forth his death, and plead it as our accepted sacrifice and ransom. The Lord's supper is not an ordinance to be observed merely for a time, but to be continued. The apostle lays before the Corinthians the danger of receiving it with an unsuitable temper of mind; or keeping up the covenant with sin and death, while professing to renew and confirm the covenant with God. No doubt such incur great guilt, and so render themselves liable to spiritual judgements. But fearful believers should not be discouraged from attending at this holy ordinance. The Holy Spirit never caused this scripture to be written to deter serious Christians from their duty, though the devil has often made this use of it. The apostle was addressing Christians, and warning them to beware of the temporal judgements with which God chastised his offending servants. And in the midst of judgement, God remembers mercy: he many times punishes those whom he loves. It is better to bear trouble in this world, than to be miserable for ever. The apostle points our the duty of those who come to the Lord's table. Self-examination is necessary to right attendance at this holy ordinance. If we would thoroughly search ourselves, to condemn and set right what we find wrong, we should stop Divine judgements. The apostle closes all with a caution against the irregularities of which the Corinthians were guilty at the Lord's table. Let all look to it, that they do not come together to God's worship, so as to provoke him, and bring down vengeance on themselves.</body></html>
