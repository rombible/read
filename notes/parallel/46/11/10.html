What is meant, first, by the woman having "power on her head?"<p>1. There have been many--some of them most fanciful--suggestions that the word for power (<span class= "ital">exousia</span>) may have crept in instead of some other word by the mistake of some copyist; or that the word used by St. Paul may have been <span class= "ital">exiousa</span>--"When she goes out in public;" or two words (<span class= "ital">ex ousias</span>)--"in accordance with her nature." All explanations, however, which require an alteration in the Greek text of the passage must be set aside, for (1) there is no MS. evidence whatever to support any other reading than the ordinary one, <span class= "ital">exousian;</span> and (2) any alteration of a difficult or unusual word would have been naturally into a word that would simplify the passage--whereas here, if alteration has taken place, it has been to insert a word which has increased the obscurity of a difficult passage.<p>2. It has been maintained that the word <span class= "ital">exousia</span> here means the sign of power, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a veil, which is the symbol of the husband's power over the wife. The fatal objection to this view, however, is that <span class= "ital">exousia</span> expresses our own power, and not the power exercised by another over us. It is a word frequently used by St. Paul in this sense. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.">1Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Have we not power to eat and to drink?">1Corinthians 9:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.">1Corinthians 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-18.htm" title="What is my reward then? Truly that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.">1Corinthians 9:18</a>.) Whatever interpretation, therefore, we put upon this passage, it must be consistent with this word being interpreted as meaning some "power" which the woman herself has, and not some power exercised over her by her husband.<p>Most commentators have quoted a passage from Diodorus Sic. i. 47, in which the Greek word "kingdom" (<span class= "ital">basileia</span>) is used to signify "crown," as an illustration of the use of the word indicating the thing symbolised for the symbol itself. The parallelism between that use of the word kingdom, and the use here of the word "power," has been very positively denied (Stanley and others), on the ground that the "use of the name of the thing signified for the symbol, though natural when the power spoken of belongs to the person, would be unnatural when applied to the power exercised over that person by some one else." But the parallelism will hold good if we can refer the "power" here to some symbol of a power which belongs to the woman herself.<p>If we bear in mind the Apostle's constant use of words with a double significance, or rather with both an obvious and a subtly implied meaning, and if we also recall the reference made to a woman's abundance of hair in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.">1Corinthians 11:5-6</a>, and the further reference to a woman's long hair in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-14.htm" title="Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him?">1Corinthians 11:14-15</a>, where the hair of the woman, given her by nature, and the wearing of a veil are used as almost identical thoughts, we may, I think, conclude that the "power" here spoken of is that long hair which is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-15.htm" title="But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.">1Corinthians 11:15</a> her "glory." It is remarkable that Callistratus twice uses this word <span class= "ital">exousia</span> in connection with hair to express its abundance. To the Jews the recollection of Samson's history would have given the word "power," when applied to hair, a remarkable significance. To thus turn aside abruptly in the middle of a long passage in which woman's subordination is enforced, and speak suddenly and vividly of her "power," would be eminently Pauline. In the Apostle's writings the thought of inferiority and superiority, of ruler and server, are frequently and almost paradoxically regarded and enforced as identical. To serve because you rule; to be weak because you are in another sense strong, are thoughts strikingly combined again and again in the Epistles of St. Paul. Thus I would imagine him here to suddenly turn aside and say, I have been speaking of your bondage and subordination, you are, because of this, to have a covering (a veil or long hair) on your head as a sign, and yet that very thing which is the symbol of your subjection to man is the sign of your beauty and "power" as a woman.<p><span class= "bld">Because of the angels.</span>--Why should a woman have her head covered (either with her natural veil of hair, or with an artificial veil shrouding her face) because of the angels? The same objections which have been already stated to any alteration of the usual Greek text of the earlier clause of this verse apply equally here. The MS. evidence is unanimous in favour of the word "angels," nor can we accept any of the figurative meanings attached to the word angel as "the president" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-1.htm" title="To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things said he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 2:1</a>), or "messenger," sent by enemies to see what took place contrary to general custom in those assemblies. We must take the word "angel" in its ordinary and general sense.<p>That the angels were present in assemblies for worship was an idea prevalent among the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-1.htm" title="I will praise you with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise to you.">Psalm 138:1</a>, in the LXX.), and regarded as they were by the Christian as "ministering spirits" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>), no doubt their presence would be realised in the meetings of Christians.<p>We have already seen that the Apostle in his argument upon the relation of the sexes to each other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7-9</a>), refers to the first three chapters of Genesis as illustrating and enforcing that relationship. What more natural than that his thoughts should have gone on to 1 Corinthians 6 of the same book, where is the record of the angels (in the LXX. the word translated "sons of God" is "the angels"--<span class= "ital">angeloi</span>) having been enamoured by the beauty of women, and so having fallen from their high estate. This account of "the fall of the angels" is referred to more than once elsewhere in the New Testament (see Jude <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a>), and through Rabbinical interpretations would have been familiar to St. Paul's converts. Without at all necessarily expressing his belief in the historic accuracy of this legendary view of the fall of the angels, St. Paul might use it as an argument with those who did believe it (as in the case of the Rock. see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>, and Note there). You believe--would be St. Paul's appeal to these women--that once, through seeing the beauty of the daughters of men, the holy angels themselves fell--even that thought ought to make you feel that it is not seemly for you to be without a veil (of which your "power on your head," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> your hair, is the type) in those assemblies where the angels are present as God's ministering spirits.<p>It has been urged (by Meyer and others) that the word "angels," in the New Testament, always signifies <span class= "ital">good angels,</span> and it is in that sense I would regard it here, for the thought surely is, that they are good angels, and should not, therefore, be tempted. I presume the idea was also that the fallen angels were "good" before their fall.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To</span> <span class="cmt_word">have power on her head.</span> A great deal of irrelevant guesswork has been written on this verse. Under this head must be classed the idle attempts to twist the word <span class="accented">exousia</span>, power, or authority, into some other reading - an attempt which may be set aside, because it is not sanctioned by a single manuscript. We may also dismiss the futile efforts to make <span class="accented">exousia</span> have any other primary meaning than "authority." The <span class="accented">context</span> shows that the word has here a <span class="accented">secondary</span> sense, and implies <span class="accented">some kind of covering.</span> The verse, therefore, points the same lessons as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-64.htm">Genesis 24:64, 65</a>. This much may be regarded as certain, and this view is adopted by the steadfast good sense of our English translators, both in the Authorized and Revised Versions. The only question worth asking is <span class="accented">why</span> the word <span class="accented">exousia</span> had come at Corinth, or in the Corinthian Church, to be used for "a veil," or "covering." The simplest answer is that just as the word "kingdom" in Greek may be used for "a crown" (comp. <span class="accented">regno</span> as the name of the pope's tiara), so "<span class="accented">authority"</span> may mean "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">sign of authority"</span> (Revised Version), or "a covering, in sign that she is under the power of her husband" (Authorized Version, margin). The margin of the Revised Version, "authority over her head," is a strange suggestion. Some have explained the word of <span class="accented">her own</span> true authority, which consists in accepting the rule of her husband; but it probably moans <span class="accented">a sign of her husband's authority over her.</span> Similarly the traveller Chardin says that in Persia the women wear a veil, in sign that they are "under subjection." If so, the best comment on the word may be found in the exquisite lines of Milton, which illustrate the passage in other ways also - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"She, as a vei1, down to the slender waist<br />Her unadorned golden tresses wore...<br />As the vine curves her tendrils, which implied<br />Subjection, but required with gentle sway,<br />And by her yielded, by him best received."</span> The fact that Callistratus twice uses <span class="accented">exousia</span> of "abundance of hair" is probably a mere coincidence, resembling the Irish expression "a power of hair." Nor can there be any allusion to the isolated fact that Samson's strength lay in his hair. The very brief comment of Luther sums up all the best of the many pages which have been written on the subject. He says that <span class="accented">exousia</span> means "the veil or covering, by which one may see that she is under her husband's authority" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because of the angels.</span> In this clause also we must set aside, as idle waste of time, the attempts to alter the text, or to twist the plain words into impossible meanings. The word "angels" cannot mean "Church officials," or "holy men," or "prophets," or "delegates," or "'bridegroom's men," or anything but angels. Nor can the verse mean, as Bengel supposes, that women are to veil themselves because the angels do so (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>), or (as Augustine says) because the angels approve of it. The only question is whether the allusion is to good or bad angels. In favour of the latter view is<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"></span> the universal tradition among the Jews that the angels fell by lust for mortal women, which was the Jewish way of interpreting <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1, 2</a>. This is the view of Tertullian ('De Virg. Vel.,' 7) in writing on this subject. A woman, in the opinion and traditions of Oriental Jews, is liable to injury from the <span class="accented">shedim</span>, if she appears in public unveiled; and these evil spirits are supposed to delight in the appearance of unveiled women. The objection to this view, that <span class="accented">angeloi</span> alone is never used of evil but always of good angels, is not perhaps decisive (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-3.htm">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>). The verse may, however, mean (in accordance with the Jewish belief of those days) that good angels, being under the possibility of falling from the same cause as their evil brethren, fly away at once from the presence of unveiled women. Thus Khadijah tested that the visitant of her husband Mohammed really was the angel Gabriel, because he disappeared the moment she unveiled her head. On the whole, however, the meaning seems to be, <span class="accented">out of respect and reverence for the holy angels, who are always invisibly present in the Christian assemblies.</span> (On this point, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-10.htm">Luke 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-1.htm">Psalm 138:1</a> [LXX.]; Tobit 12:12. See Latimer's 'Sermons,' p. 253). "Reverence the angels" is St. Chrysostom's remark. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:2-16 Here begin particulars respecting the public assemblies, ch. 1Co 14. In the abundance of spiritual gifts bestowed on the Corinthians, some abuses had crept in; but as Christ did the will, and sought the honour of God, so the Christian should avow his subjection to Christ, doing his will and seeking his glory. We should, even in our dress and habit, avoid every thing that may dishonour Christ. The woman was made subject to man, because made for his help and comfort. And she should do nothing, in Christian assemblies, which looked like a claim of being equal. She ought to have power, that is, a veil, on her head, because of the angels. Their presence should keep Christians from all that is wrong while in the worship of God. Nevertheless, the man and the woman were made for one another. They were to be mutual comforts and blessings, not one a slave, and the other a tyrant. God has so settled matters, both in the kingdom of providence and that of grace, that the authority and subjection of each party should be for mutual help and benefit. It was the common usage of the churches, for women to appear in public assemblies, and join in public worship, veiled; and it was right that they should do so. The Christian religion sanctions national customs wherever these are not against the great principles of truth and holiness; affected singularities receive no countenance from any thing in the Bible.</body></html>
