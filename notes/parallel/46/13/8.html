The Corinthians held an exaggerated estimate of the value of gifts such as tongues and prophecy, and under-valued the graces of faith and love. Now the Apostle shows that they were thereby preferring the things which are for a time to the graces which are for ever. One faction, indeed, exalted to the highest place a gift--that of tongues--which was the most ephemeral of all Christian gifts. On the "tongues," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1Corinthians 14:2</a>. "Prophecies," in the plural, intimates the varied gradations of power possessed by the preachers, in some cases including that deep spiritual insight into the realities of the present which enabled the preacher to foretell distant events.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">eternal permanence of love.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Never faileth.</span> The word "faileth" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) has two technical meanings between which it is not easy to decide. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It means, technically, "<span class="accented">is</span> <span class="accented">never hissed off the stage</span> like a bad actor," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it has its part to play even on the stage of eternity. This is its meaning in classic Greek. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> it means <span class="accented">"falls away"</span> like the petals of a withered flower (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-11.htm">James 1:11</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>). Here, perhaps, the meaning is not technical, but general, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a> and in the LXX. (Job 21:43). But the reading may be simply <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (falleth), as in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A,B,C. <span class="cmt_word">They shall fail</span>. This is not the same word as the one on which we have been commenting; it means "shall be annulled" or "done away;" and is the same verb as that rendered in the next clauses by "vanish away," "be done away" (ver. 10), and "put away" (ver. 11). Thus in two verses we have the same word rendered by four different phrases. No doubt the effect of the change sounds beautifully to ears accustomed to the "old familiar strain;" but it is the obvious duty of translators <span class="accented">to represent</span>, not <span class="accented">to improve upon</span>, the language of their author. In the Revised Version the stone word is rightly kept for the four recurrences of the verb. <span class="cmt_word">Tongues.</span> Special <span class="accented">charisms</span> are enumerated to show the transcendence of love. <span class="cmt_word">Knowledge</span>. This shall be only annulled in the sense of earthly knowledge, which shall be a star disappearing in the light of that heavenly knowledge which shall gradually broaden into the perfect day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:8-13 Charity is much to be preferred to the gifts on which the Corinthians prided themselves. From its longer continuance. It is a grace, lasting as eternity. The present state is a state of childhood, the future that of manhood. Such is the difference between earth and heaven. What narrow views, what confused notions of things, have children when compared with grown men! Thus shall we think of our most valued gifts of this world, when we come to heaven. All things are dark and confused now, compared with what they will be hereafter. They can only be seen as by the reflection in a mirror, or in the description of a riddle; but hereafter our knowledge will be free from all obscurity and error. It is the light of heaven only, that will remove all clouds and darkness that hide the face of God from us. To sum up the excellences of charity, it is preferred not only to gifts, but to other graces, to faith and hope. Faith fixes on the Divine revelation, and assents thereto, relying on the Divine Redeemer. Hope fastens on future happiness, and waits for that; but in heaven, faith will be swallowed up in actual sight, and hope in enjoyment. There is no room to believe and hope, when we see and enjoy. But there, love will be made perfect. There we shall perfectly love God. And there we shall perfectly love one another. Blessed state! how much surpassing the best below! God is love, 1Jo 4:8,16. Where God is to be seen as he is, and face to face, there charity is in its greatest height; there only will it be perfected.</body></html>
