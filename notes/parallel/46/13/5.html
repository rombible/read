Vulgar indecorum is alien from love, as having its root in selfishness and want of sympathy. "Noble manners" are ever the fruit of "noble minds." "Be courteous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Seeketh not her own.</span> Self seeking is the root of All evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-24.htm">1 Corinthians 10:24, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is not easily provoked.</span> The word "easily" is here a gloss. The corresponding substantive (<span class="accented">paroxusmos</span>, whence our "paroxysm") is used of the sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-39.htm">Acts 15:39</a>). Love, when it is perfected, rises superior to all temptations to growing <span class="accented">exasperated</span>, although it may often be justly indignant. But, as St. Chrysostom says, "As a spark which falls into the sea hurts not the sea, but is itself extinguished, so an evil thing befalling a loving soul will be extinguished without disquietude." Thinketh no evil; literally, <span class="accented">doth not reckon</span> (or, <span class="accented">impute</span>) <span class="accented">the evil.</span> The phrase seems to be a very comprehensive one, implying that love is neither suspicious, nor implacable, nor retentive in her memory of evil done. Love writes our personal wrongs in ashes or in water. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:4-7 Some of the effects of charity are stated, that we may know whether we have this grace; and that if we have not, we may not rest till we have it. This love is a clear proof of regeneration, and is a touchstone of our professed faith in Christ. In this beautiful description of the nature and effects of love, it is meant to show the Corinthians that their conduct had, in many respects, been a contrast to it. Charity is an utter enemy to selfishness; it does not desire or seek its own praise, or honour, or profit, or pleasure. Not that charity destroys all regard to ourselves, or that the charitable man should neglect himself and all his interests. But charity never seeks its own to the hurt of others, or to neglect others. It ever prefers the welfare of others to its private advantage. How good-natured and amiable is Christian charity! How excellent would Christianity appear to the world, if those who profess it were more under this Divine principle, and paid due regard to the command on which its blessed Author laid the chief stress! Let us ask whether this Divine love dwells in our hearts. Has this principle guided us into becoming behaviour to all men? Are we willing to lay aside selfish objects and aims? Here is a call to watchfulness, diligence, and prayer.</body></html>
