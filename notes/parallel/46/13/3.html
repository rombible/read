The whole of the bestower's property given in charity, and so divided as to reach the largest number.<p><span class= "bld">I give my body to be burned.</span>--A still greater proof of devotion to some person or cause, is the sacrifice of life; yet even that may be without love. A strange reading has crept into some MSS.--"that I may boast"--which would make the passage mean that a man gave his body to some torture from a wrong motive, viz., vain-glory. But this would weaken the force of the passage. What renders the self-sacrifice valueless is not a wrong cause, but the absence of love as the motive power. Although burning was not a form of martyrdom at this time, yet such histories as that of the three children in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-19.htm" title="Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.">Daniel 3:19</a> would make the expression intelligible and forcible.<p>These words are historically interesting to the English Church. They formed the text from which Dr. Smith preached at the martyrdom of Latimer and Ridley!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor.</span> The five words, "bestow to feed the poor," represent the one Greek word <span class="accented">psomiso</span>, and after all do not give its force. It is derived from <span class="accented">psomion</span>, a mouthful, and so means "give away by mouthfuls," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">dole</span> away." It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a> for "feed." Attention to this verse might have served as a warning against the often useless and sometimes even pernicious doles of mediaeval monasteries. Much of the "charity" of these days is even more uncharitable than this, and shows the most complete absence of true charity; as for instance the dropping of pennies to professional beggars, and so putting a premium on vice and imposture. <span class="cmt_word">To be burned</span>. The reading is extremely uncertain. The change of a letter gives the reading, <span class="accented">that I may glory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Perhaps the scribes thought that "death by burning" was as yet (A.D. 57) an unheard of form of martyrdom, though it became but too familiar ten or twelve years later in the Neronian persecution. St. Paul was, however, probably referring, not, as some have supposed, to <span class="accented">branding</span>, which would bare been expressed differently, but to the case of the "three children," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-23.htm">Daniel 3:23</a>, where the LXX. has, "They gave their bodies <span class="accented">into the fire</span>;" or to the various tortures and deaths by fire in 2 Macc. 7. At the burning of Ridley and Latimer, Dr. Smith chose this verse for his text. Its applicability is on a par with millions of other instances in which Scripture has been grossly abused by employing its letter to murder its spirit, and by taking it from the God of love to give it to the devil of religious hatred. The burning of a saint was a singular specimen of the Church's "love." <span class="cmt_word">It profiteth me nothing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I am nothing benefited.</span> A consideration of this verse might have shown the Christians of the early centuries that there was nothing <span class="accented">intrinsically</span> redemptive in the martyrdom into which they often thrust themselves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-3 The excellent way had in view in the close of the former chapter, is not what is meant by charity in our common use of the word, almsgiving, but love in its fullest meaning; true love to God and man. Without this, the most glorious gifts are of no account to us, of no esteem in the sight of God. A clear head and a deep understanding, are of no value without a benevolent and charitable heart. There may be an open and lavish hand, where there is not a liberal and charitable heart. Doing good to others will do none to us, if it be not done from love to God, and good-will to men. If we give away all we have, while we withhold the heart from God, it will not profit. Nor even the most painful sufferings. How are those deluded who look for acceptance and reward for their good works, which are as scanty and defective as they are corrupt and selfish!</body></html>
