Endures wrongs and evils, and covers them with a beautiful reticence. Thus love "covereth all sins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Believeth all things.</span> Takes the best and kindest views of all men and all circumstances, as long as it is possible to do so. It is the opposite to the common spirit, which drags everything <span class="accented">in deteriorem partem</span>, paints it in the darkest colours, and makes the worst of it. Love is entirely alien from the spirit of the cynic, the pessimist, the ecclesiastical rival, the anonymous slanderer, the secret detractor. <span class="cmt_word">Hopeth all things.</span> Christians seem to have lost sight altogether of the truth that hope is something more than the result of a sanguine temperament, that it is a gift and a grace. Hope is averse to sourness and gloom. It takes sunny and cheerful views of man, of the world, and of God, because it is a sister of love. <span class="cmt_word">Endureth all things.</span> Whether the "seventy times seven" offences of a brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-4.htm">Luke 17:4</a>), or the wrongs of patient merit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>), or the sufferings and self. denials and persecutions of the life spent in doing good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>). The reader need hardly he reminded that in these verses he has a picture of the life and character of Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:4-7 Some of the effects of charity are stated, that we may know whether we have this grace; and that if we have not, we may not rest till we have it. This love is a clear proof of regeneration, and is a touchstone of our professed faith in Christ. In this beautiful description of the nature and effects of love, it is meant to show the Corinthians that their conduct had, in many respects, been a contrast to it. Charity is an utter enemy to selfishness; it does not desire or seek its own praise, or honour, or profit, or pleasure. Not that charity destroys all regard to ourselves, or that the charitable man should neglect himself and all his interests. But charity never seeks its own to the hurt of others, or to neglect others. It ever prefers the welfare of others to its private advantage. How good-natured and amiable is Christian charity! How excellent would Christianity appear to the world, if those who profess it were more under this Divine principle, and paid due regard to the command on which its blessed Author laid the chief stress! Let us ask whether this Divine love dwells in our hearts. Has this principle guided us into becoming behaviour to all men? Are we willing to lay aside selfish objects and aims? Here is a call to watchfulness, diligence, and prayer.</body></html>
