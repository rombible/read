The "now" is not here temporal, but logical. It is not "now" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> this present life) contrasted with the future, but it is the conclusion of the whole argument. From all that has been urged in the previous verses it follows that these three graces--faith, hope, love--remain imperishable and immortal. Gifts such as the Corinthian Church rejoiced in shall pass away when the perfect succeeds the imperfect; the graces of faith, hope, love shall remain in the next life, exalted and purified. But even in this trinity of graces there is an order, and love stands first. The contrast is not between love which is imperishable and faith and hope which are perishable, but between ephemeral gifts and enduring graces. It is strange how completely in popular thinking this has been lost sight of, and hence we find such words as these--<p>"Faith will vanish into sight,<p>Hope be emptied in delight,<p>Love in heaven will shine more bright,<p>Therefore give us love;"<p>which express almost the opposite of what the Apostle really wrote.<p>There need be no difficulty in understanding that "faith," in the sense of trust in Christ as our Saviour, may continue in the heavenly state; indeed, when we see Him face to face, and see actually how great a salvation He hath obtained for us, that faith may' be expected to glow with a new and increasing fervour Hope, too, need never cease if that new life is to be progressive. If hope lives by feeding on the present as the promise of the future, surely it will have a more abundant sustenance in that life than in this. Yet love stands supreme; indeed, both faith and hope would perish without her. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-35.htm" title="Peter said to him, Though I should die with you, yet will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.">Matthew 26:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now.</span> The "now" is not temporal (as opposed to the "then" of the previous verse), but logical. It sums up the paragraph. <span class="cmt_word">Abideth</span>. These three graces are fundamental and permanent; not transient, like the <span class="accented">charisms</span>, on which the Corinthians were priding themselves, but which should all be "annulled." <span class="cmt_word">Faith, hope, charity.</span> It might be difficult to see how "hope" should be permanent. But if the future state be progressive throughout eternity and infinitude, hope will never quite be lost in fruition. Even "within the veil," it will still remain as "an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The greatest of these is charity;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">greater than these is love.</span> St. Paul does not explain <span class="accented">why</span> love is the greatest and best of the three. Various reasons may be given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Love is the greatest, because it is the root of the other two; "we <span class="accented">believe</span> only in that which we love; we <span class="accented">hope</span> only for that which we love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> And love is the greatest because love is for our neighbours; faith and hope mainly for ourselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> And love is the greatest because faith and hope are human, but God is love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> And love is the greatest because faith and hope can only work by love, and only show themselves by love. Thus love is as the undivided perfection of sevenfold light. Faith and hope are precious stones of one colour, as a ruby and a sapphire; but love, as he has been showing us throughout the chapter, is a diamond of many facets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:8-13 Charity is much to be preferred to the gifts on which the Corinthians prided themselves. From its longer continuance. It is a grace, lasting as eternity. The present state is a state of childhood, the future that of manhood. Such is the difference between earth and heaven. What narrow views, what confused notions of things, have children when compared with grown men! Thus shall we think of our most valued gifts of this world, when we come to heaven. All things are dark and confused now, compared with what they will be hereafter. They can only be seen as by the reflection in a mirror, or in the description of a riddle; but hereafter our knowledge will be free from all obscurity and error. It is the light of heaven only, that will remove all clouds and darkness that hide the face of God from us. To sum up the excellences of charity, it is preferred not only to gifts, but to other graces, to faith and hope. Faith fixes on the Divine revelation, and assents thereto, relying on the Divine Redeemer. Hope fastens on future happiness, and waits for that; but in heaven, faith will be swallowed up in actual sight, and hope in enjoyment. There is no room to believe and hope, when we see and enjoy. But there, love will be made perfect. There we shall perfectly love God. And there we shall perfectly love one another. Blessed state! how much surpassing the best below! God is love, 1Jo 4:8,16. Where God is to be seen as he is, and face to face, there charity is in its greatest height; there only will it be perfected.</body></html>
