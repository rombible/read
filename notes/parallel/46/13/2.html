He therefore naturally selects it as coming into the same condemnation, if unaccompanied by love. All the secrets of God's providence and complete knowledge (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:8</a>), even such a transcendent faith as Christ had spoken of as capable of moving mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.">Matthew 17:20</a>), may belong to a man, and without love he is nothing. We must not take these words as implying that the Apostle possessed this vast knowledge and faith personally. The whole argument is put hypothetically--it supposes a man possessed of these qualities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophecy</span>. The power of lofty utterance belonged to Balaam and Caiaphas; yet it availed them nothing without love.

Yet he answers them," I never knew you." <span class="cmt_word">All mysteries.</span> Though I can speak of the secrets of God once hidden but now revealed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-27.htm">Romans 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And all knowledge.</span> Insight into the deeper meanings of Scripture, etc. <span class="cmt_word">All faith.</span> Not here meaning "justifying faith," or "saving faith," which can no more exist without showing itself in works than light can exist without heat; but <span class="accented">fides miraculosa</span>, reliance on the power to work wonders. Judas, for instance, must have possessed this kind of faith, and it was exercised by "many" who will yet be rejected because they also work iniquity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So that I could remove mountains.</span> It has been supposed that this must be a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>. It is, however, much more probable that, if St. Paul derived the words from our Lord, they came to him by oral tradition.

Without this, the most glorious gifts are of no account to us, of no esteem in the sight of God. A clear head and a deep understanding, are of no value without a benevolent and charitable heart. There may be an open and lavish hand, where there is not a liberal and charitable heart. Doing good to others will do none to us, if it be not done from love to God, and good-will to men. If we give away all we have, while we withhold the heart from God, it will not profit. Nor even the most painful sufferings. How are those deluded who look for acceptance and reward for their good works, which are as scanty and defective as they are corrupt and selfish!</body></html>
