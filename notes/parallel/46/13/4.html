It endures evils; it confers blessings. <span class="cmt_word">Envieth not.</span> Its negative characteristics are part of its positive perfection. Envy - "one shape of many names" - includes malice, grudge, jealousy, pique, an evil eye, etc., with all their base and numerous manifestations. <span class="cmt_word">Vaunteth not itself.</span> The meaning would probably be most nearly expressed by the colloquialism, <span class="accented">does not show off.</span> It does not, for instance, "do its alms before men to be seen of them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>). The Latin <span class="accented">perperus</span>, which is from the same root as this word, means "a braggart," or "swaggerer." Cicero, speaking of a grand oratorical display of his own before Pompey, says to Atticus, "Good heavens! how I <span class="accented">showed myself off</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) before my new hearer, Pompeius!" ('Ad. Art.,' 1:14). <span class="cmt_word">Is not puffed up.</span> Has no purse proud or inflated arrogance." Love, therefore, is free from the characteristic vice of the Corinthian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6, 18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:4-7 Some of the effects of charity are stated, that we may know whether we have this grace; and that if we have not, we may not rest till we have it. This love is a clear proof of regeneration, and is a touchstone of our professed faith in Christ. In this beautiful description of the nature and effects of love, it is meant to show the Corinthians that their conduct had, in many respects, been a contrast to it. Charity is an utter enemy to selfishness; it does not desire or seek its own praise, or honour, or profit, or pleasure. Not that charity destroys all regard to ourselves, or that the charitable man should neglect himself and all his interests. But charity never seeks its own to the hurt of others, or to neglect others. It ever prefers the welfare of others to its private advantage. How good-natured and amiable is Christian charity! How excellent would Christianity appear to the world, if those who profess it were more under this Divine principle, and paid due regard to the command on which its blessed Author laid the chief stress! Let us ask whether this Divine love dwells in our hearts. Has this principle guided us into becoming behaviour to all men? Are we willing to lay aside selfish objects and aims? Here is a call to watchfulness, diligence, and prayer.</body></html>
