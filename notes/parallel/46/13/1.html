Without it all moral and intellectual gifts are valueless. If there be love--the love of God, and the love of our brethren--in our hearts, all will be well. This hymn of praise in honour of love is remarkable. (1) as coming from St. Paul, and not from St. John, from whose pen we might naturally have looked for it; and (2), occurring here in an atmosphere of controversy, preceded and succeeded as it is by close logical argument.<p>On the first point we may observe what a striking illustration it is of the completeness of St. Paul's character. The clear, vigorous intellect and the masculine energy of the great Apostle are united to a heart full of tenderness. We can almost feel its pulsations, we can almost hear its mighty throbbings, in every line of this poem.<p>That this passage should be found in the middle of a protracted argument suggests the idea that we have here the result of a sudden and direct inspiration. The Apostle had always been conscious of a mighty power working in him, mastering him, bringing him into captivity to Christ. There suddenly flashes upon him the realisation of what that power is, and he cannot but at once give utterance, in language of surpassing loftiness and glowing with emotion, to the new and profound conviction which has set his whole soul aflame. This chapter is the Baptismal Service of Love. Here it receives its new Christian name. The word (<span class= "ital">agape</span>) which is used here for love is peculiar to the New Testament (and a few passages in the LXX.). It is not to be found in any heathen writer. The word "charity," which signifies either tolerance or almsgiving, is an insufficient rendering of the original, and destroys the force of the passage, especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing.">1Corinthians 13:3</a>, where "almsgiving" without love is pronounced worthless. The Latin <span class= "ital">caritas</span> was used as the rendering of <span class= "ital">agape,</span> probably because the ordinary Latin word <span class= "ital">amor</span> (love) was considered too significant of a mere earthly or fleshly affection; and hence the word "charity" in the English version. Perhaps it was hoped that the word "charity," when planted in such a soil. and with such surroundings, would have grown to have that larger significance to which the original gives expression. If so, the experiment has not succeeded, the word has not become acclimatised to this chapter. The word "love" had better be restored here. The rare purity of its surrounding atmosphere will completely deprive it of any earthly or sensual taint.<p>This chapter, occupied with the one main thought, divides itself into three parts--<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.">1Corinthians 13:1-3</a>. The greatest gifts are valueless without LOVE.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,">1Corinthians 13:4-7</a>. The pre-eminent characteristics of LOVE.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1Corinthians 13:8-13</a>. Gifts are transient; virtues are eternal, and chief of them is LOVE.<p><span class= "bld">Tongues of men and of angels.</span>--The gift of tongues (see Notes on 1 Corinthians 14) is placed first as that most over-estimated at Corinth. It is useless without love. It would be impossible to define love, as it is impossible to define life; but the best conception of what St. Paul means by love can be found from the description which he subsequently gave of it. Stanley, contrasting the meaning of the word employed by St. Paul with the various words for love in other literature, remarks: "While the 'love' of the New Testament retains all the fervour of the Hebrew 'aspiration' and 'desire,' and of the 'personal affection' of the Greek, it ranges through as wide a sphere as the comprehensive 'benevolence' of Alexandria. Whilst it retains the religious element that raised the affections of the Hebrew Psalmist to the presence of God, it agrees with the classical and Alexandrian feelings in making its chief object the welfare of man. It is not religion evaporated into benevolence, but benevolence taken up into religion. It is the practical exemplification of the two great characteristics of Christianity, the union of God with man, the union of religion with morality; love to man for the sake of love to God, love to God showing itself in love to man."<p><span class= "bld">As sounding brass.</span>--Not a brass trumpet, or instrument of any kind, but simply a piece of metal, which when struck will merely produce noise.<p><span class= "bld">A tinkling cymbal.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a clanging cymbal.</span> This instrument can produce by itself no intelligible tune. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm" title="Many, O LORD my God, are your wonderful works which you have done, and your thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order to you: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.">Psalm 40:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The supremely excellent way of Christian love.</span> This chapter has been in all ages the object of the special admiration of the Church. Would that it had received in all ages the loftier and more valuable admiration which would have been expressed by an acceptance of its lessons! Tertullian says that it is uttered "with all the force of the Spirit" (<span class="accented">totis Spiritus viribus</span>). It is a glorious hymn or paean in honour of Christian love, in which St. Paul rises on the wings of inspiration to the most sunlit heights of Christian eloquence. Like the forty-fifth psalm, it may be entitled "A Psalm of Love." Valcknaer says that the "oratorical figures which illuminate the chapter have been born spontaneously in an heroic soul, burning with the love of Christ, and placing all things lower than this Divine love." In vers. 1-3 he shows the absolute <span class="accented">necessity</span> for love; in vers. 4-7 its characteristics; in vers. 8-12 its eternal permanence; in ver. 13 its absolute supremacy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels</span>. The case is merely <span class="accented">supposed.</span> The tongues of men are human languages, including, perhaps, the peculiar utterance of ecstatic inspiration with which he is now dealing. It is, perhaps, with reference to this latter result of spiritual exultation, at any rate in its purest and loftiest developments, that he adds the words, "and of angels." It is unlikely that he is referring to the rabbinic notion that the angels only understood Hebrew, and not Aramaic or other languages. The words are meant to express the greatest possible climax. The most supreme powers of utterance, even of angelic utterance - if any of the Corinthians had or imagined that they had attained to such utterance - are nothing in comparison with the universally possible attainment of Christian love. It is remarkable that here again he places "tongues," even in their grandest conceivable development, on the <span class="accented">lowest</span> step in his climax. <span class="cmt_word">And have not charity.</span> It is deeply to be regretted that the translators of the Authorized Version here introduced from the Vulgate a new translation for the sacred word "love," which dominates the whole New Testament as its Divine keynote. Greek possesses two words for "love." One of these, <span class="accented">eros</span>, implying as it did the love which springs from sensual passion, was dyed too deeply in pagan associations to be capable of redemption into holier usage. It is characteristic of the difference between paganism and Christianity, that Plato's eulogy in the 'Symposium' is in honour of <span class="accented">eros</span>, not of anything resembling <span class="accented">agape.</span> The apostles, therefore, were compelled to describe the ideal of the gospel life by another word, which expressed the love of esteem and reverence and sacred tenderness - the word <span class="accented">agape.</span> This word was not indeed classical. No heathen writer had used it. But the verb <span class="accented">agapao</span>, corresponding to the Latin <span class="accented">diligo</span>, and bring reserved for this loftier kind of love, suggested at once the substantive <span class="accented">agape</span>, which, together with the similar substantive <span class="accented">agapesis</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>, etc.), had already been adopted by the LXX. and by Philo and in Wisd. 3:9. The word is thus, as Archbishop Trench says, "born in the bosom of revealed religion" ('New Testament Synonyms,' p. 41). The Vulgate chose <span class="accented">caritas</span> (whence our "charity") to express this love of reason and affection, the dearness which reigns between human beings, and between man and God. This word, like <span class="accented">agape</span>, is absolutely unstained with any evil association. If "charity" had been <span class="accented">exclusively</span> used for <span class="accented">agape</span>, no objection need have arisen, although "love" is English while "charity" is Latin. But it was an Unmixed evil that, by the use of two different words for the same Greek word, English readers should have been prevented from recognizing the unity of thought on this subject which prevails among all the books of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7, 8</a>, etc.). To argue that the word "love" in English is not unmingled with unhallowed uses is absurd, because those uses of the word have never been supposed for a single moment to intrude into multitudes of other passages where love is used to render <span class="accented">agape.</span> Who has ever dreamed of objecting on such grounds to the favourite hymn? - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Faith and Hope and Love we see<br />Joining hand in hand agree;<br />But the greatest of the three<br />And the best is Love."</span> It is true that Lord Bacon admired "the discretion and tenderness of the Rhenish Version" in using the word "charitie," "because of the indifferencies and equivocation of the word [love] with impure love." But that objection, if it ever existed, has now been done away with by the use of "love" in such a multitude of other pure and lofty passages of Holy Writ. It is, therefore, a great gain that the Revised Version restored to this passage the word "love," which had been used by Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Geneva Bible. For in modern English usage the word "charity" is almost confined to "almsgiving," and that of a kind which is often made an excuse for shirking all real self denial, and for <span class="accented">not</span> acting up to the true spirit of love. Christian love is always and infinitely blessed, but the almsgiving which has usurped the name of "charity" often does more harm than good. <span class="cmt_word">I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">I have become booming brass, or clanging cymbal.</span> My "tongues" without "love" become a mere discordant, obtrusive, unintelligible dissonance. The Greek word for "clanging" (<span class="accented">alalazon</span>) is an onomatopoeia, like the Hebrew name for cymbals, <span class="accented">tseltselim</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-3 The excellent way had in view in the close of the former chapter, is not what is meant by charity in our common use of the word, almsgiving, but love in its fullest meaning; true love to God and man. Without this, the most glorious gifts are of no account to us, of no esteem in the sight of God. A clear head and a deep understanding, are of no value without a benevolent and charitable heart. There may be an open and lavish hand, where there is not a liberal and charitable heart. Doing good to others will do none to us, if it be not done from love to God, and good-will to men. If we give away all we have, while we withhold the heart from God, it will not profit. Nor even the most painful sufferings. How are those deluded who look for acceptance and reward for their good works, which are as scanty and defective as they are corrupt and selfish!</body></html>
