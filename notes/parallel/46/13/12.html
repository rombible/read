If we remember the imperfect metal surfaces which formed the mirrors of those days, we can imagine how imperfect and enigmatical (the Greek word is "in an <span class= "ital">enigma"</span>) would the image appear; so that the Apostle says, "Like that image which you see when you look at an object in a mirror far off, with blurred and undefined outline, such is our knowledge here and now; but <span class= "ital">then</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> when this dispensation is at an end) we shall see as you see a man when you stand before him face to face. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7-8</a> for a similar thought, but a different illustration of it--"mouth to mouth.") The word for "glass" here is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-23.htm" title="For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glass:">James 1:23</a>, and must mean a mirror, and not, as some commentators suggest, a pane of transparent stone or horn, such as was then used, for which a quite different word would have been employed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Through a glass;</span> rather, <span class="accented">through</span> (or, <span class="accented">by means of</span>) <span class="accented">a mirror.</span> Our "glasses" were unknown in that age. The mirrors were of silver or some polished metal, giving, of course, a far dimmer image than "glasses" do. The rabbis said that "all the prophets saw through a dark mirror, but Moses through a bright one." St. Paul says that no human eye can see God at all except as an image seen as it were behind the mirror. <span class="cmt_word">Darkly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in a riddle.</span> God is said to have spoken to Moses "by means of riddles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>; Authorized Version, "in dark speeches"), Human language, dealing with Divine facts, can only represent them indirectly, metaphorically, enigmatically, under human images, and as illustrated by visible phenomena. God can only be represented under the phrases of anthropomorphism and anthropopathy; and such phrases can only have <span class="accented">a relative</span>, not an absolute, truth. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "when the perfect is come." <span class="cmt_word">Face to face.</span> Like the "mouth to mouth" of the Hebrew and the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>. This is the beatific vision. "We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). "Now we walk by faith, <span class="accented">not by sight"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Then shall I know even as also I am known; rather, <span class="accented">then shall I fully know even as also I was fully known</span>, viz. when Christ took knowledge of me at my conversion. Now, we do not so much "know" God, but "rather <span class="accented">are known of God"</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:8-13 Charity is much to be preferred to the gifts on which the Corinthians prided themselves. From its longer continuance. It is a grace, lasting as eternity. The present state is a state of childhood, the future that of manhood. Such is the difference between earth and heaven. What narrow views, what confused notions of things, have children when compared with grown men! Thus shall we think of our most valued gifts of this world, when we come to heaven. All things are dark and confused now, compared with what they will be hereafter. They can only be seen as by the reflection in a mirror, or in the description of a riddle; but hereafter our knowledge will be free from all obscurity and error. It is the light of heaven only, that will remove all clouds and darkness that hide the face of God from us. To sum up the excellences of charity, it is preferred not only to gifts, but to other graces, to faith and hope. Faith fixes on the Divine revelation, and assents thereto, relying on the Divine Redeemer. Hope fastens on future happiness, and waits for that; but in heaven, faith will be swallowed up in actual sight, and hope in enjoyment. There is no room to believe and hope, when we see and enjoy. But there, love will be made perfect. There we shall perfectly love God. And there we shall perfectly love one another. Blessed state! how much surpassing the best below! God is love, 1Jo 4:8,16. Where God is to be seen as he is, and face to face, there charity is in its greatest height; there only will it be perfected.</body></html>
