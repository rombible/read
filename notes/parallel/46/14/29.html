Only two or three prophets are to speak in each assembly on each occasion; the others (not "other," as in English version) who had the gift are to sit by silent and judging, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> determining whether the utterances were from the Spirit of God. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1Corinthians 12:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1John 4:1-3</a>.) If, however, while one prophet was standing speaking there came a sudden revelation of truth to some other prophet who was sitting by, the speaker would pause, and the other prophet give utterance to the inspiration which had come to him. The suddenness of the revelation would show that it was a truth needed there and then, and so should find utterance without delay.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two or three.</span> If more than two or three preached, the congregation would get weary. <span class="cmt_word">Let the other judge;</span> rather, <span class="accented">let the</span> <span class="accented">rest discriminate</span> the value of what is said. "Prophesyings" are not to be despised, but we are only to hold fast what is good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20, 21</a>), and we are "to try the spirits" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>). St. Paul is not encouraging the Corinthians to the consoriousness of conceited and incompetent criticism, but only putting them on their guard against implicit acceptance of all they hear; which was a very necessary caution at a place where so many teachers sprang up. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:26-33 Religious exercises in public assemblies should have this view; Let all be done to edifying. As to the speaking in an unknown tongue, if another were present who could interpret, two miraculous gifts might be exercised at once, and thereby the church be edified, and the faith of the hearers confirmed at the same time. As to prophesying, two or three only should speak at one meeting, and this one after the other, not all at once. The man who is inspired by the Spirit of God will observe order and decency in delivering his revelations. God never teaches men to neglect their duties, or to act in any way unbecoming their age or station.</body></html>
