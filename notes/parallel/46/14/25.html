It is the third result of the prophetic utterances explained in previous Note. His complete conversion is evidenced by his worshipping God and recognising the presence of God in that assembly of Christians: "He will confess that you are not mad, but that God is truly in you, and that He is the true God who is in you" (Bengel). It is to be noticed that though the Apostle speaks in this passage of an "unlearned" person (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a private person, one who has no gift of prophecy or tongues), or an "unbeliever," it is the latter that is most prominently before his mind, and the former only so far as he shared in common with the latter his ignorance and inability to understand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The secrets of his heart.</span> "The Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword,.., <span class="accented">and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Falling down on his face.</span> An Oriental. mode of showing humility and deep conviction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>).

A truly Christian minister will seek much more to do spiritual good to men's souls, than to get the greatest applause to himself. This is proving himself the servant of Christ. Children are apt to be struck with novelty; but do not act like them. Christians should be like children, void of guile and malice; yet they should not be unskilful as to the word of righteousness, but only as to the arts of mischief. It is a proof that a people are forsaken of God, when he gives them up to the rule of those who teach them to worship in another language. They can never be benefitted by such teaching. Yet thus the preachers did who delivered their instructions in an unknown tongue. Would it not make Christianity ridiculous to a heathen, to hear the ministers pray or preach in a language which neither he nor the assembly understood? But if those who minister, plainly interpret Scripture, or preach the great truths and rules of the gospel, a heathen or unlearned person might become a convert to Christianity. His conscience might be touched, the secrets of his heart might be revealed to him, and so he might be brought to confess his guilt, and to own that God was present in the assembly. Scripture truth, plainly and duly taught, has a wonderful power to awaken the conscience and touch the heart.</body></html>
