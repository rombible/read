He first gives directions regarding the tongues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-27.htm" title="If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.">1Corinthians 14:27-28</a>), then regarding prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-29.htm" title="Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.">1Corinthians 14:29-36</a>), and the concluding verses of this chapter contain a summing up and brief repetition of what has been already laid down. In this verse he introduces the practical application of the truths which he has been enforcing, by the question, "How is it, then?"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> what should follow from all these arguments?--and, instead of answering the question directly, he first recalls the existing state of confusion in their public assemblies, which had rendered necessary the teaching of the previous verses, and which is to be remedied by the practical instructions which now follow.<p><span class= "bld">When ye come together, every one of you hath . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">when ye are assembling together each one of you hath a psalm, &c.</span> The uppermost thought in each mind as you are assembling for public worship is the individual gift which he possesses. One had the gift of pouring forth a psalm of praise; another could deliver a doctrinal discourse; another could speak to God in a tongue; another had some deep insight into the spiritual world; another could interpret the tongue. If these varied gifts were employed by each for his own gratification, or even for his own spiritual advancement, they would not be used worthy of the occasion. In public these gifts were to be exercised not by each one for himself, but for the building up of the whole Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-33.</span> - <span class="accented">Rules to check disorderly self-assertion in Christian assemblies.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How is it then?</span> The same phrase as in ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">Every one of you hath a psalm,</span> etc. We see here a somewhat melancholy picture of the struggling self assertion of rival claimants to attention. <span class="cmt_word">A doctrine;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a teaching</span>, The glossolaly had probably been promoted by Syrian enthusiasts, perhaps of the Petrine party; the egotism of oratory and itch of teaching now described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>) may have been developed in the Apollonian party. <span class="cmt_word">Unto edifying.</span> The object is moral improvement, not idle self display, not the ostentation of individual gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7, 8, 10</a>). To this he recurs again and again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3, 5, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-19.htm">2 Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>; and the verb frequently). The substantive, as used by St. Paul, only occurs again in Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-2.htm">Romans 15:2</a>), and in Ephesians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:26-33 Religious exercises in public assemblies should have this view; Let all be done to edifying. As to the speaking in an unknown tongue, if another were present who could interpret, two miraculous gifts might be exercised at once, and thereby the church be edified, and the faith of the hearers confirmed at the same time. As to prophesying, two or three only should speak at one meeting, and this one after the other, not all at once. The man who is inspired by the Spirit of God will observe order and decency in delivering his revelations. God never teaches men to neglect their duties, or to act in any way unbecoming their age or station.</body></html>
