Their conduct in exalting these "tongues," against which he has been warning them, is a proof that they are yet children in knowledge.

It is remarkable that this is the only verse of the New Testament in which the common Greek word "mind" (<span class="accented">phren</span>) occurs. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit in malice be ye children;</span> better, <span class="accented">but in wickedness be babes.</span> The Authorized Version misses the climax involved in the change of the word.

A truly Christian minister will seek much more to do spiritual good to men's souls, than to get the greatest applause to himself. This is proving himself the servant of Christ. Children are apt to be struck with novelty; but do not act like them. Christians should be like children, void of guile and malice; yet they should not be unskilful as to the word of righteousness, but only as to the arts of mischief. It is a proof that a people are forsaken of God, when he gives them up to the rule of those who teach them to worship in another language. They can never be benefitted by such teaching. Yet thus the preachers did who delivered their instructions in an unknown tongue. Would it not make Christianity ridiculous to a heathen, to hear the ministers pray or preach in a language which neither he nor the assembly understood? But if those who minister, plainly interpret Scripture, or preach the great truths and rules of the gospel, a heathen or unlearned person might become a convert to Christianity. His conscience might be touched, the secrets of his heart might be revealed to him, and so he might be brought to confess his guilt, and to own that God was present in the assembly.
