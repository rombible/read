He has spoken enthusiastically in praise of the superiority of love as the greatest amongst graces, and of all graces as superior to all gifts; but still, though we are to "do this," we are not to leave the other undone. Spiritual gifts are to be "earnestly striven for." As there was a priority in graces, so there is in gifts. To prophesy is the greatest gift; it is so, as we see afterwards, because it makes us useful to our brethren; therefore it is to be striven for rather than any other gift.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-25.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">gift of preaching superior to the gift</span> <span class="accented">tongues</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Follow after charity;</span> literally, <span class="accented">chase</span>; <span class="accented">pursue.</span> The word is one of which St. Paul is fond (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-30.htm">Romans 9:30, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And desire;</span> rather, <span class="accented">yet be zealous for</span>.

This drew attention, more than the plain interpretation of Scripture; it gratified pride more, but promoted the purposes of Christian charity less; it would not equally do good to the souls of men. What cannot be understood, never can edify. No advantage can be reaped from the most excellent discourses, if delivered in language such as the hearers cannot speak or understand. Every ability or possession is valuable in proportion to its usefulness. Even fervent, spiritual affection must be governed by the exercise of the understanding, else men will disgrace the truths they profess to promote.</body></html>
