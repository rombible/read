This verse similarly deals with the general principle laid down in the latter part of the chapter regarding the style and order of public worship. The object of all church assemblies is to be the building up of the Body of Christ, which is His Church; and therefore seemliness and ordered regularity are absolutely necessary to this end. Here again, as in so many other instances in this Epistle, while the particular and unique circumstances which called forth the apostolic instructions have for centuries passed away, the writings of St. Paul are of permanent and abiding application, because of the general and eternal principles on which his instructions are based. The strange outbursts of incoherent fanaticism which have occurred from time to time in the after-history of the Church are condemned by the principle with which St. Paul combatted the disorder of the gift of tongues in Corinth; and the practice of the Roman Church, in performing her public services in a tongue not "understanded of the people," is at variance with the principle which in this chapter he reiterates with varied emphasis--that all public utterance of prayer and praise should be such as those present can join in, not only with emotional heart but with clear and understanding intellect.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let all things.</span> The "but" of the original should not be omitted.

The Spirit of Christ can never contradict itself; and if their revelations are against those of the apostle, they do not come from the same Spirit. The way to keep peace, truth, and order in the church, is to seek that which is good for it, to bear with that which is not hurtful to its welfare, and to keep up good behaviour, order, and decency.</body></html>
