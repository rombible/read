How can he say "Amen" when he does not know what is being said? and he cannot know if you speak in a tongue, without interpreting. It would seem from this verse that from the earliest apostolic times the practice has been for the congregation to join in the thanksgiving by uttering "Amen" (the Hebrew "So be it") at the conclusion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That occupieth the room of the unlearned;</span> that is, "one in the position of an ordinary worshipper, who has no spiritual gifts."

The sound of the loud unanimous "Amen" of early Christian congregations is compared to the echo of distant thunder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Et resonaturum ferit aethera vocibus Amen."</span> Being the answer of the congregation, the "Amen" was regarded as no less important than the prayer itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:15-25 There can be no assent to prayers that are not understood. A truly Christian minister will seek much more to do spiritual good to men's souls, than to get the greatest applause to himself. This is proving himself the servant of Christ. Children are apt to be struck with novelty; but do not act like them. Christians should be like children, void of guile and malice; yet they should not be unskilful as to the word of righteousness, but only as to the arts of mischief. It is a proof that a people are forsaken of God, when he gives them up to the rule of those who teach them to worship in another language. They can never be benefitted by such teaching. Yet thus the preachers did who delivered their instructions in an unknown tongue. Would it not make Christianity ridiculous to a heathen, to hear the ministers pray or preach in a language which neither he nor the assembly understood? But if those who minister, plainly interpret Scripture, or preach the great truths and rules of the gospel, a heathen or unlearned person might become a convert to Christianity. His conscience might be touched, the secrets of his heart might be revealed to him, and so he might be brought to confess his guilt, and to own that God was present in the assembly. Scripture truth, plainly and duly taught, has a wonderful power to awaken the conscience and touch the heart.</body></html>
