This is not the place to enter into the question of what particular external manifestation of this gift was evidenced on the Day of Pentecost. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1-13</a>.) Still, believing that the gift of tongues here spoken of is identical with the gift of tongues which was first bestowed at Pentecost, I would say that the phenomena described as occurring then must be explained by the fuller and more elaborate account of the nature of the gift which is given to us here. Against the theory that the gift was one of a capacity to speak various languages we have three considerations. (1) The word <span class= "ital">dialectos,</span> which is repeatedly used to express languages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-19.htm" title="And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; so as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.">Acts 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-6.htm" title="Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.">Acts 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-8.htm" title="And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?">Acts 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-40.htm" title="And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,">Acts 21:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-2.htm" title="(And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he said,)">Acts 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>), is never used by St. Paul or by the author of the Acts in reference to the utterances of those who possessed the gift of tongues, but the other word, <span class= "ital">glossa,</span> which is, literally, the physical organ of speech--as if the utterances were simply sounds that proceeded from it. (2) There is no trace whatever of this knowledge of languages having been ever used for the purpose of preaching to those who spoke foreign languages. The language of the Lycaonians was evidently not understood by the Apostles when they were addressed in it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-11.htm" title="And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.">Acts 14:11</a>), and they did not speak in it. That the hearers at Pentecost said they heard those who were filled with the Spirit "speak in our own language" would only imply, either that the outpouring on Pentecost had for the moment a miraculous effect, which immediately ceased, or that "all the various elements of Aramaic and Hellenistic speech, latent in the usual language of the time, were quickened, under the power of this gift, into a new life, sometimes intelligible, sometimes unintelligible to those who heard it, but always expressive of the vitality and energy of the Spirit by which it was animated." (3) The description of the gift in this chapter is utterly inconsistent with it being a gift of languages. The gift was the result of a quickened spiritual power by the action of the Holy Ghost (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44-46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>); it poured itself forth in wild, impassioned utterances, which were sometimes mistaken for delirium (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1Corinthians 14:23</a>); and these were the expressions, not of thoughts, but of feelings, unintelligible always, if uninterpreted, to the listener, and sometimes to the utterer himself.<p>It is to be observed that very notable spiritual phenomena, not unlike what are recorded here, accompanied many periods of great spiritual revival. The histories of the early work of Wesley and Whitfield, and of Irving--to take examples in England alone--afford some very remarkable illustrations. The general subject of the first part of this chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-1.htm" title="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.">1Corinthians 14:1-25</a>) is the Gift of Tongues, and is thus dealt with:--<p>I.PROPHECY IS SUPERIOR TO THE GIFT OF TONGUES (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1Corinthians 14:2-11</a>)<p>Because (1)Tongues are the means of communion between the individual and God, whereas prophecy is communion with other men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1Corinthians 14:2-3</a>).<p>(2)Tongues do yourself good; prophecy does good to others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-4.htm" title="He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.">1Corinthians 14:4-6</a>).<p>This truth is illustrated (<span class= "ital">a</span>) by the variety of musical instruments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-7.htm" title="And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?">1Corinthians 14:7</a>); (<span class= "ital">b</span>) by the distinction of musical notes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-8.htm" title="For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?">1Corinthians 14:8-9</a>); (<span class= "ital">c</span>) by the varieties of human language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-10.htm" title="There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.">1Corinthians 14:10-11</a>).<p>II.PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE FOREGOING (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-11.htm" title="Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.">1Corinthians 14:11-19</a>).<p>(1)What the aim and object of the Christians should be (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1Corinthians 14:12-13</a>).<p>(2)His own example (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-14.htm" title="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.">1Corinthians 14:14-19</a>).<p>III.FURTHER APPEAL TO THEIR INTELLIGENCE AS TO THIS TRUTH (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-21.htm" title="In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.">1Corinthians 14:21-25</a>).<p>(1)The Old Testament teaches the same principle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-21.htm" title="In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.">1Corinthians 14:21-22</a>).<p>(2)The gift of prophecy is a means of spreading Christianity, and the gift of tongues is not (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1Corinthians 14:23-25</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</span>--The utterances come, not from his mind, but from his spirit, stirred by the Holy Spirit; and he speaks mysteries unintelligible to others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In an unknown tongue.</span> The interpolation of the word "unknown" in our Authorized Version is quite unjustifiable, and shows the danger of giving way to the bias of mere conjectures. Probably it is this word, not found in the original, which has given rise to the perplexing, unhistoric, and unwarranted theory that "the gift of tongues" was a power of speaking in foreign languages. <span class="cmt_word">Speaketh not unto men</span>. Because, as a rule, no one understands anything that he says. The word literally means "hears." It may, perhaps, imply that no special attention was given to those who gave way to these impulses of utterance. The whole of this chapter proves in a most striking way the close analogy between "the tongue" and the impassioned soliloquies of inarticulate utterance which were poured forth in tones of thrilling power among the Montanists, and in modern times among the Irvingites. <span class="cmt_word">In the spirit.</span> It is uncertain whether this means "in his own spirit," or "in the Spirit of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a result of inspiration. Probably the former (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, etc.). Perhaps, however, the two imply the same thing. The spirit is the one Divine part of our human being, and when a man is a true Christian his spirit is in union with, is as it were lost in, the Spirit of God. St. Paul recognizes the true tongue - for it might be <span class="accented">simulated</span> by hysteria and even by mere physical imposture - as a result of inspiration, that is, of the overpowering dominance of the human spirit by a supernatural power. Nevertheless, he points out the extreme peril of yielding to or self inducing these emotions public, or in leaving them uncontrolled. <span class="cmt_word">Mysteries.</span> Secrets revealed possibly to him, but unrevealed by this strange "tongue" to others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-5 Prophesying, that is, explaining Scripture, is compared with speaking with tongues. This drew attention, more than the plain interpretation of Scripture; it gratified pride more, but promoted the purposes of Christian charity less; it would not equally do good to the souls of men. What cannot be understood, never can edify. No advantage can be reaped from the most excellent discourses, if delivered in language such as the hearers cannot speak or understand. Every ability or possession is valuable in proportion to its usefulness. Even fervent, spiritual affection must be governed by the exercise of the understanding, else men will disgrace the truths they profess to promote.</body></html>
