The passage may run, either, as in the English, <span class= "ital">if any man does not know this, let</span> <span class= "ital">him not know it:</span> then the words would mean that a person who could not recognise such an evident and simple truth must be of a perverse mind--his opposition would give the Apostle no further concern. The other reading is, <span class= "ital">if any man knows not this, he is himself</span> <span class= "ital">not known:</span> this would signify that any man who knows not this truth is not known of God (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="And if any man think that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.">1Corinthians 8:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let him be ignorant.</span> The formula seems to fall under the idiom which refuses to say anything more about a subject ("If I perish, I perish;" "What I have written, I have written;" "He that is filthy, let him be filthy still," etc.). The readings vary considerably ("He is ignored;" "He has been ignored;" "He shall be ignored;" "Let him be ignored"). These other readings would be a statement of retribution in kind - of God "sprinkling penal blindnesses on forbidden lusts." But the reading of our translation is on the whole the best supported, and means that to invincible bigotry and ignorant obstinacy St. Paul will have no more to say (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:34-40 When the apostle exhorts Christian women to seek information on religious subjects from their husbands at home, it shows that believing families ought to assemble for promoting spiritual knowledge. The Spirit of Christ can never contradict itself; and if their revelations are against those of the apostle, they do not come from the same Spirit. The way to keep peace, truth, and order in the church, is to seek that which is good for it, to bear with that which is not hurtful to its welfare, and to keep up good behaviour, order, and decency.</body></html>
