A mystery means something which up to this time has been kept concealed, but is now made manifest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3-5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be Changed.</span>--There are here a considerable variety of readings in the Greek, but the text from which our English version is taken is probably correct. The Apostle believed that the end of the world might come in the lifetime of some then living. We shall not all, he says, necessarily sleep, but we shall all be changed. The change from the earthly to the spiritual body is absolutely necessary. To some it will come through the ordinary process of death; to those who are alive at Christ's advent it will come suddenly, and in a moment. The dead shall be raised, but we (the living) shall be changed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I show you a mystery.</span> I make known to you a truth now made known to me by revelation. <span class="cmt_word">We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.</span> There is a great diversity of readings in this verse, noticed even by St. Jerome and St. Augustine. St. Jerome says that all the Latin manuscripts had "we shall all rise," and that the Greek manuscripts wavered between "we shall all sleep" and "we shall not all sleep." Some Greek manuscripts had "we shall all rise, but we shall not all be changed." This reading cannot be right, for it contradicts the next verse. There is little doubt that the reading of the Authorized version is right. It accounts for all the variations. They arose from a desire to shelter St. Paul from an apparent mistake, since he and his readers <span class="accented">did</span> all sleep. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> St. Paul may have written under that conception of the imminence of Christ's personal return which he expresses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15-17</a>, where he evidently imagines that the majority of those to whom he was writing would be of those who would be "alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> even if he no longer entertained that expectation, the "we" may naturally apply to the continuity of the Christian Church. For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a> he uses "us" of those who shall die and be raised. The universal expectation of the immediate return of Christ in the first century rose <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from their non apprehension of the truth that the close of the old dispensation <span class="accented">was</span> the "coming" to which our Lord had primarily referred in his great eschatological discourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the fact that watchfulness was intended to be the attitude of the Church, and the day and hour of Christ's coming were kept absolutely unrevealed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-13.htm">Matthew 25:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:51-58 All the saints should not die, but all would be changed. In the gospel, many truths, before hidden in mystery, are made known. Death never shall appear in the regions to which our Lord will bear his risen saints. Therefore let us seek the full assurance of faith and hope, that in the midst of pain, and in the prospect of death, we may think calmly on the horrors of the tomb; assured that our bodies will there sleep, and in the mean time our souls will be present with the Redeemer. Sin gives death all its hurtful power. The sting of death is sin; but Christ, by dying, has taken out this sting; he has made atonement for sin, he has obtained remission of it. The strength of sin is the law. None can answer its demands, endure its curse, or do away his own transgressions. Hence terror and anguish. And hence death is terrible to the unbelieving and the impenitent. Death may seize a believer, but it cannot hold him in its power. How many springs of joy to the saints, and of thanksgiving to God, are opened by the death and resurrection, the sufferings and conquests of the Redeemer! In verse 58, we have an exhortation, that believers should be stedfast, firm in the faith of that gospel which the apostle preached, and they received. Also, to be unmovable in their hope and expectation of this great privilege, of being raised incorruptible and immortal. And to abound in the work of the Lord, always doing the Lord's service, and obeying the Lord's commands. May Christ give us faith, and increase our faith, that we may not only be safe, but joyful and triumphant.</body></html>
