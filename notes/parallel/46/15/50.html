(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;">1Corinthians 7:29</a>.) The statement so introduced here is that flesh and blood, being corruption, cannot enter into the heavenly state, which is incorruption. This is still part of the answer to the question, "With what bodies do they come?" but the reply is no longer based upon any analogy. It comes now as a revelation of what he had been taught by the Spirit of God. Flesh and blood are indeed corruption. Blood is everywhere the type of this lower <span class= "ital">animal</span> life. Blood is the life of the flesh; and so, though Jews might eat the flesh, they might not eat the blood, which is the life thereof (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm" title="But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not eat.">Genesis 9:4</a>). All offerings which typified the offering up and sacrifice of "self"--the lower sinful self--were sacrifices by shedding of blood, without which was no remission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.">Hebrews 9:22</a>). When the supreme Sacrifice was made on Calvary the blood was shed--once for all. So when Christ showed His resurrection body to His disciples He did not say, "A spirit hath not flesh and blood, as ye see Me have;" but "A spirit hath not 'flesh and bones,' as ye see Me have." The blood of Christ is never spoken of as existing after His crucifixion. That was the supreme sacrifice of Self to God. The blood--the type of the human self--was poured out for ever. It is to be noticed also that the phrase "of His flesh and of His bones" (not His "blood," which the Eucharistic Feast would have suggested) was evidently in ordinary use, as it was interpolated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>.<p>The blood, as the type of our lower nature, is familiar in all popular phraseologies, as when we say, for example, that a "man's blood is up," meaning that his physical nature is asserting itself. One characteristic of the resurrection body, therefore, is that it shall be bloodless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 50-58.</span> - <span class="accented">Conclusion and exhortation.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now this I say.</span> This sums up my meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Flesh and blood.</span> Our mortal nature and human organism; our "earthly house of this tabernacle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Inherit incorruption.</span> A body liable to corruption, with all its loathly accompaniments, cannot enter into the "inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:35-50 1. How are the dead raised up? that is, by what means? How can they be raised? 2. As to the bodies which shall rise. Will it be with the like shape, and form, and stature, and members, and qualities? The former objection is that of those who opposed the doctrine, the latter of curious doubters. To the first the answer is, This was to be brought about by Divine power; that power which all may see does somewhat like it, year after year, in the death and revival of the corn. It is foolish to question the Almighty power of God to raise the dead, when we see it every day quickening and reviving things that are dead. To the second inquiry; The grain undergoes a great change; and so will the dead, when they rise and live again. The seed dies, though a part of it springs into new life, though how it is we cannot fully understand. The works of creation and providence daily teach us to be humble, as well as to admire the Creator's wisdom and goodness. There is a great variety among other bodies, as there is among plants. There is a variety of glory among heavenly bodies. The bodies of the dead, when they rise, will be fitted for the heavenly bodies. The bodies of the dead, when they rise, will be fitted for the heavenly state; and there will be a variety of glories among them. Burying the dead, is like committing seed to the earth, that it may spring out of it again. Nothing is more loathsome than a dead body. But believers shall at the resurrection have bodies, made fit to be for ever united with spirits made perfect. To God all things are possible. He is the Author and Source of spiritual life and holiness, unto all his people, by the supply of his Holy Spirit to the soul; and he will also quicken and change the body by his Spirit. The dead in Christ shall not only rise, but shall rise thus gloriously changed. The bodies of the saints, when they rise again, will be changed. They will be then glorious and spiritual bodies, fitted to the heavenly world and state, where they are ever afterwards to dwell. The human body in its present form, and with its wants and weaknesses, cannot enter or enjoy the kingdom of God. Then let us not sow to the flesh, of which we can only reap corruption. And the body follows the state of the soul. He, therefore, who neglects the life of the soul, casts away his present good; he who refuses to live to God, squanders all he has.</body></html>
