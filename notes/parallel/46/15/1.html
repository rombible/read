The occasion which caused the Apostle to dwell at such length and with such emphasis on this subject was the denial of the resurrection by some members of the Corinthian Church. It has been suggested by some writers that what the Apostle had to combat was a false conception of the resurrection--that at Corinth there were probably those who refined away the doctrine of the resurrection into merely a rising from the death of sin into a life of righteousness, something after the manner of Hymenaeus and Philetus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-17.htm" title="And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;">2Timothy 2:17-18</a>), who taught that "the resurrection was past already." It seems clear, however, from the emphatic statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1Corinthians 15:12</a>, and from the general scope and drift of the entire argument, that what the Apostle is here meeting is not a perversion, but a denial of the doctrine. There were many elements in such a mixed body as the Corinthian Church which would have contributed to the growth of this error. Amongst the Jewish converts would be some traces of the Sadducean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-23.htm" title="The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,">Matthew 22:23</a>) denial of the resurrection, and in the Gentile section of the Church there would linger the spirit of the Athenians who "mocked when they heard of the resurrection of the dead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-32.htm" title="And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter.">Acts 17:32</a>), and of the Epicurean philosophers who said, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." From these and from other like sources there had crept into the Church itself a denial of the doctrine of the resurrection. In reading this chapter it is well to remember that the Apostle probably intended it, not only as a reply to these corruptors of the faith, but as supplying those who remained faithful with a confirmation of their own faith, and arguments with which they might meet their opponents. It is always difficult to give a clear, exhaustive analysis of an argument by such a writer as St. Paul. The enthusiasm of his nature leads him to mingle the syllogism of passion with the syllogism of logic; and, as he was not writing himself, but dictating the composition, a word often leads him off from his argument into some splendid outburst of pathetic exhortation, or of prophetic utterance. Still, including such digressions, the general argument of this chapter may be tabulated thus:--<p>I.--THE DOCTRINE OF THE RESURRECTION (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1Corinthians 15:1-34</a>).<p>Subdivided as follows:<p>(1) <span class= "ital">The resurrection proved by the historical fact of Christ's resurrection</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1Corinthians 15:1-15</a>).<p>(2) <span class= "ital">The resurrection proved by an appeal to the moral consequences involved in a</span> <span class= "ital">denial of it</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-16.htm" title="For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:">1Corinthians 15:16-28</a>).<p>(3) <span class= "ital">The truth of the resurrection involved in certain existing practices</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-29.htm" title="Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?">1Corinthians 15:29-34</a>).<p>II.--THE METHOD AND PRINCIPLE OF THE RESURRECTION (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?">1Corinthians 15:35-58</a>).<p>(1) <span class= "ital">Illustration from analogy</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?">1Corinthians 15:35-44</a>).<p>(2) <span class= "ital">Illustration from our dual descent from. Adam and from Christ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1Corinthians 15:44-49</a>).<p>(3) <span class= "ital">The great change</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1Corinthians 15:50-53</a>).<p>(4) <span class= "ital">A song of triumph</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-54.htm" title="So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.">1Corinthians 15:54-57</a>).<p>(5) <span class= "ital">Concluding exhortation</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-58.htm" title="Therefore, my beloved brothers, be you steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.">1Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I declare unto you.</span>--The Apostle opens his historical argument by reminding the Corinthians that this is no new nor unimportant matter. It is the original gospel which he had preached to them, which they received, and in which they stand, and by which they <span class= "ital">are being saved</span> (not "are saved," as in the English).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-58.</span> - <span class="accented">The doctrine of the resurrection.</span> This chapter, and the thirteenth, on Christian love, stand out, even among the writings of St. Paul, as pre-eminently beautiful and important. No human words ever written have brought such comfort to millions of mourners as the words of this chapter, which form a part of the Burial Service of almost every Christian community. It is the more deeply imprinted on the memory of men because it comes to us in the most solemn hours of bereavement, when we have most need of a living faith. The chapter falls into six sections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The evidence of Christ's resurrection (vers. 1-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The resurrection of Christ is the foundation of our faith in the general resurrection (vers. 12-19). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Results to be deduced from Christ's resurrection (vers. 20 - 28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The life of believers an argument for the resurrection (vers. 29-34). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> Analogies helpful for understanding the subject (vers. 35-49). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> Conclusion and exhortation (vers. 50-58). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">The evidence of the resurrection of Christ.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> of the original merely marks the transition to a new topic. <span class="cmt_word">The gospel</span>. He here uses the word with special reference to the Resurrection, which is one of the most central and necessary doctrines of the "good tidings," and which always occupied a prominent place in St. Paul's preaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-18.htm">Acts 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>), as well as in that of all the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">have received;</span> rather, <span class="accented">ye received.</span> The "also" is emphatic. The Corinthians had not been like Christ's "own," who "received him not" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-11 The word resurrection, usually points out our existence beyond the grave. Of the apostle's doctrine not a trace can be found in all the teaching of philosophers. The doctrine of Christ's death and resurrection, is the foundation of Christianity. Remove this, and all our hopes for eternity sink at once. And it is by holding this truth firm, that Christians stand in the day of trial, and are kept faithful to God. We believe in vain, unless we keep in the faith of the gospel. This truth is confirmed by Old Testament prophecies; and many saw Christ after he was risen. This apostle was highly favoured, but he always had a low opinion of himself, and expressed it. When sinners are, by Divine grace, turned into saints, God causes the remembrance of former sins to make them humble, diligent, and faithful. He ascribes to Divine grace all that was valuable in him. True believers, though not ignorant of what the Lord has done for, in, and by them, yet when they look at their whole conduct and their obligations, they are led to feel that none are so worthless as they are. All true Christians believe that Jesus Christ, and him crucified, and then risen from the dead, is the sun and substance of Christianity. All the apostles agreed in this testimony; by this faith they lived, and in this faith they died.</body></html>
