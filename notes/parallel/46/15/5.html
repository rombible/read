We have these appearances:--(1) To Cephas (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-34.htm" title="Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.">Luke 24:34</a>). (2) To the Twelve--the phrase "the Twelve" being used to indicate, not the number of those present, but the group to which they belonged, as Decemviri might be used, or Hebdomadal Council, not to express the exact number but the corporate body--(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-36.htm" title="And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.">Luke 24:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>). This was probably the appearance to the ten Apostles, and is distinguished from a subsequent appearance to "all the Apostles." (3) To above five hundred brethren at once. This must have been in Galilee, for at a later date (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm" title="And in those days Peter stood up in the middle of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)">Acts 1:15</a>) the Church at Jerusalem consisted of only one hundred and twenty disciples. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/28-16.htm" title="Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.">Matthew 28:16-17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm" title="And in those days Peter stood up in the middle of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)">Acts 1:15</a>.) (4) To James. This appearance is recorded only here and in the Gospel of the Hebrews, which is quoted by St. Jerome, "But the Lord, when he had given the <span class= "ital">sindon</span>" (the same word as that for the "linen garment," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-51.htm" title="And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:">Mark 14:51</a>) "to the servant of the priest, had a table brought out, and bread on it, which He blessed and gave to James, saying, 'Eat thy bread now, brother, since the Son of Man has risen from the dead;' for James had sworn that he would not eat bread from the hour in which he had drunk the cup of the Lord until he should see Him rising from the dead." (5) To all the Apostles, Thomas being present (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-26.htm" title="And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the middle, and said, Peace be to you.">John 20:26</a>). (6) St. Paul himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm" title="And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 9:5</a>). To these facts St. Paul appeals. Most of those who saw Him were alive. Their enemies were alive to dispute it if they could. The witnesses had nothing to gain, everything to lose by telling the truth. The evidence was set forth some twenty-five or thirty years after the occurrence of the alleged facts. The Apostle here maintains the truth of an historical fact. He appeals solely to historical proof, and accumulates a mass of historical testimony, such as in any matter of history, if produced so shortly after the occurrence, would be deemed overwhelming.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was seen of Cephas</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-34.htm">Luke 24:34</a>). The appearances to the women (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14</a>, etc.) are omitted, as being evidential rather to the apostles than to the world. <span class="cmt_word">The twelve</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19, 26</a>). Some officious scribes have in some manuscripts altered the word into" the eleven." But "the twelve" is here the designation of <span class="accented">an office</span>, and great ancient writers are always indifferent to mere pragmatic accuracy in trifles which involve nothing. To witness to the Resurrection was a main function of "the twelve" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-40.htm">Acts 10:40</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-11 The word resurrection, usually points out our existence beyond the grave. Of the apostle's doctrine not a trace can be found in all the teaching of philosophers. The doctrine of Christ's death and resurrection, is the foundation of Christianity. Remove this, and all our hopes for eternity sink at once. And it is by holding this truth firm, that Christians stand in the day of trial, and are kept faithful to God. We believe in vain, unless we keep in the faith of the gospel. This truth is confirmed by Old Testament prophecies; and many saw Christ after he was risen. This apostle was highly favoured, but he always had a low opinion of himself, and expressed it. When sinners are, by Divine grace, turned into saints, God causes the remembrance of former sins to make them humble, diligent, and faithful. He ascribes to Divine grace all that was valuable in him. True believers, though not ignorant of what the Lord has done for, in, and by them, yet when they look at their whole conduct and their obligations, they are led to feel that none are so worthless as they are. All true Christians believe that Jesus Christ, and him crucified, and then risen from the dead, is the sun and substance of Christianity. All the apostles agreed in this testimony; by this faith they lived, and in this faith they died.</body></html>
