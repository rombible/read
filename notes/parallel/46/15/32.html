What is the advantage or necessity of my incurring daily risks, if I am merely a human being, with a life limited by what we see, and no immortality and resurrection awaiting me?<p><span class= "bld">I have fought with beasts at Ephesus.</span>--The question here arises, Are these words to be taken literally or figuratively? Does St. Paul refer to some actual contest in the arena with beasts, or to his conflict with the opponents at Ephesus, whom he thus designates beasts? It is scarcely possible to accept the former interpretation. There is no mention to be found of it in the Acts, and, moreover, his Roman citizenship would have legally protected him against such treatment. We must therefore conclude that the Ephesians themselves are spoken of as "beasts." Both Hebrew and Greek literature would have made such a form of expression familiar to the Apostle and to his readers. In the Psalms (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/22-20.htm" title="Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.">Psalm 22:20-21</a>) the opponents of God are similarly spoken of. The Cretans are called "evil beasts" by the poet Epimenides, whom St. Paul quotes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a>. Heraclitus calls the Ephesians "beasts"--the same word as St. Paul uses here; and St. Ignatius (<span class= "ital">Epis. ad Rom.</span>) speaks of "fighting with beasts by land and sea," and having been bound to 'ten leopards,' that is a band of soldiers."<p>Although the Greek verb implies that reference is made, not to general or prolonged opposition, but to some one outburst of rage on the part of his opponents, we must not take it as indicating the scene described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23-34</a>, which had probably not taken place when this was written; but no doubt the "many adversaries" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm" title="For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.">1Corinthians 16:9</a>) at Ephesus had already availed themselves of some opportunity of venting their rage on the Apostle after the manner of wild beasts (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">What advantageth it me?</span>--This sentence is completed with these words, and should be followed by a note of interrogation, thus--"What advantageth it me?" (See next Note.)<p><span class= "bld">If the dead rise not?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">if the dead be not</span> <span class= "ital">raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.</span> If the dead be not raised our conduct is illogical. Consistency then belongs to those who disregard God's call to repentance, and of whom we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm" title="And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.">Isaiah 22:13</a>, that they say, "Let us eat and drink." The reference is directly to this passage in the prophet describing the conduct of abandoned Jews during the siege of Jerusalem; but the words indicate with equal accuracy that school of Epicurean philosophy of which, no doubt, there were many representatives at Corinth. Similar expressions are to be found in many classical writers; but the most remarkable instance of the use of these words is where they occur in an inscription on a statue at Anchiale, a town in Cilicia, which was St. Paul's native province--"Sardanapalus, the son of Anacyn-draxes, built Anchiale and Tarsus in one day. Stranger, eat, drink, and play, for all the rest is not worth this." The figure is represented as making a contemptuous motion with its fingers. Saul of Tarsus had probably often seen that statue and inscription.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After the manner of men.</span> The phrase is a qualification of the strong metaphor, "I fought with beasts." It is equivalent to "humanly speaking." This is Chrysostom's view. It is the most reasonable, and accords with the use of the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>. Meyer, however, explains it to mean "with mere human motives." <span class="cmt_word">I have fought with beasts.</span> Not literally, for in that case he would have mentioned it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11.htm">2 Corinthians 11</a>. as one of his deadliest perils, and it must have been recorded by St. Luke in his full account of St. Paul's life at Ephesus. A Roman citizen was legally exempt from this mode of punishment. The word points to some special peril incurred in resisting the hostility of the worshippers of Artemis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>), but not to the tumult in the theatre, which did not happen till after this letter was despatched (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8, 9</a>). The metaphor is not uncommon. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a> St. Paul alludes to Nero (probably) as "the lion." David often compares his enemies to wild beasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>, etc.). When his jailor informed Agrippa of the death of Tiberius, he did so in the words, "The lion is dead." St. Ignatius writes of the ten soldiers who were conducting him to Rome as "ten leopards." Epimenides, in the line quoted by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>, spoke of the Cretans as "evil wild beasts," and the pseudo-Heraclitus gives this same uncomplimentary title to these very Ephesians. <span class="cmt_word">Let as eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.</span> Perhaps the "if the dead are not raised" belongs to this clause. He means that such an Epicurean maxim, if never <span class="accented">excusable</span>, would at least be <span class="accented">natural</span>, if men could only look to life in the present. The sentiment is found on the lips of the despairing and the sensual alike in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>, and in the writings of the heathen (Horace, 'Od.,' 1:4, 13-17, etc.). St. Paul would be all the more familiar with it because it formed the infamous epitaph of a statue of Sardauapalus, which he must have often seen in his boyhood at Anchiale, near Tarsus. It represented the debased king as snapping his fingers, and using almost these very words. It is strange that similar passages should be found even in the Talmud. Shemuel said to Rav Yehudah, "Seize and eat, seize and drink; for the world is like a wedding feast (soon over)" ('Eiruvin,' fol. 54, 1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:20-34 All that are by faith united to Christ, are by his resurrection assured of their own. As through the sin of the first Adam, all men became mortal, because all had from him the same sinful nature, so, through the resurrection of Christ, shall all who are made to partake of the Spirit, and the spiritual nature, revive, and live for ever. There will be an order in the resurrection. Christ himself has been the first-fruits; at his coming, his redeemed people will be raised before others; at the last the wicked will rise also. Then will be the end of this present state of things. Would we triumph in that solemn and important season, we must now submit to his rule, accept his salvation, and live to his glory. Then shall we rejoice in the completion of his undertaking, that God may receive the whole glory of our salvation, that we may for ever serve him, and enjoy his favour. What shall those do, who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Perhaps baptism is used here in a figure, for afflictions, sufferings, and martyrdom, as Mt 20:22,23. What is, or will become of those who have suffered many and great injuries, and have even lost their lives, for this doctrine of the resurrection, if the dead rise not at all? Whatever the meaning may be, doubtless the apostle's argument was understood by the Corinthians. And it is as plain to us that Christianity would be a foolish profession, if it proposed advantage to themselves by their faithfulness to God; and to have our fruit to holiness, that our end may be everlasting life. But we must not live like beasts, as we do not die like them. It must be ignorance of God that leads any to disbelieve the resurrection and future life. Those who own a God and a providence, and observe how unequal things are in the present life, how frequently the best men fare worst, cannot doubt as to an after-state, where every thing will be set to rights. Let us not be joined with ungodly men; but warn all around us, especially children and young persons, to shun them as a pestilence. Let us awake to righteousness, and not sin.</body></html>
