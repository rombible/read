The "only" seems therefore to qualify the whole sentence: "If we have merely <span class="accented">hoped</span> in Christ, and that only in this life." <span class="cmt_word">We are of all men most miserable;</span> literally, <span class="accented">we are more pitiable than all men.</span> The remark only has an <span class="accented">absolute</span> bearing when Christians really are suffering from persecutions, as they did in St. Paul's day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>). But to some extent all Christians have to bear their cross, and if all that they give up and suffer is sacrificed to a delusion, they deserve most pity in one sense, because they have been most conspicuously befooled. In <span class="accented">another</span> sense they are still the happiest of men; for their delusion, judged by its fruits, is more blessed than the dreary blank which is the only alternative. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:12-19 Having shown that Christ was risen, the apostle answers those who said there would be no resurrection. There had been no justification, or salvation, if Christ had not risen. And must not faith in Christ be vain, and of no use, if he is still among the dead? The proof of the resurrection of the body is the resurrection of our Lord. Even those who died in the faith, had perished in their sins, if Christ had not risen. All who believe in Christ, have hope in him, as a Redeemer; hope for redemption and salvation by him; but if there is no resurrection, or future recompence, their hope in him can only be as to this life. And they must be in a worse condition than the rest of mankind, especially at the time, and under the circumstances, in which the apostles wrote; for then Christians were hated and persecuted by all men. But it is not so; they, of all men, enjoy solid comforts amidst all their difficulties and trials, even in the times of the sharpest persecution.</body></html>
