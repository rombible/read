The "James" intended is undoubtedly the only James then living, who was known to the whole Christian Church, namely, "the Lord's brother," the author of the Epistle, and the Bishop of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>). James the son of Zebedee had by this time been martyred, and James the son of Alphaeus was never much more than a name to the Church in general. There is no mention of this appearance in the Gospel; but in the Gospel of the Hebrews was a curious legend (preserved in St. Jerome, 'De Virr. Illust.,' 2.) that James had made a vow that he would neither eat nor drink till he had seen Jesus risen from the dead, and that Jesus, appearing to him, said, "My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of man is risen from the dead." The truth of the appearance is strongly supported by the fact that James, like the rest of the Lord's "brothers," "did not believe" in Christ before the Crucifixion, whereas <span class="accented">after the Resurrection</span> we find him and the rest of "the Lord's brothers" ardently convinced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>, etc.). Of all the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a>). James the Lord's brother was only an apostle in the wider sense of the word. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-11 The word resurrection, usually points out our existence beyond the grave. Of the apostle's doctrine not a trace can be found in all the teaching of philosophers. The doctrine of Christ's death and resurrection, is the foundation of Christianity. Remove this, and all our hopes for eternity sink at once. And it is by holding this truth firm, that Christians stand in the day of trial, and are kept faithful to God. We believe in vain, unless we keep in the faith of the gospel. This truth is confirmed by Old Testament prophecies; and many saw Christ after he was risen. This apostle was highly favoured, but he always had a low opinion of himself, and expressed it. When sinners are, by Divine grace, turned into saints, God causes the remembrance of former sins to make them humble, diligent, and faithful. He ascribes to Divine grace all that was valuable in him. True believers, though not ignorant of what the Lord has done for, in, and by them, yet when they look at their whole conduct and their obligations, they are led to feel that none are so worthless as they are. All true Christians believe that Jesus Christ, and him crucified, and then risen from the dead, is the sun and substance of Christianity. All the apostles agreed in this testimony; by this faith they lived, and in this faith they died.</body></html>
