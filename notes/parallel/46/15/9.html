The two thoughts of his own inherent nothingness and of his greatness by the grace of God are here mingled together in expressions of intense personal feeling. While he was a persecutor he had thought that he was acting <span class= "ital">for</span> the Church of God; he was really persecuting the Church of God. The Christian Church had completely taken the place of the Jewish Church--not merely abolished it, but superseded it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. This and the next verse are an explanation of the strong and strange term which he had applied to himself. <span class="cmt_word">The least of the apostles.</span> In St. Paul there was a true and most deep humility, but no mock modesty. He knew the special gifts which he had received from God. He was well aware that to him had been entrusted the ten talents rather than the one talent. He could appeal to far vaster results than had been achieved by the work of any other apostle. He knew his own importance as "a chosen vessel," a special instrument in God's hands to work out exceptional results. But <span class="accented">in himself</span> he always felt, and did not shrink from confessing, that he was "nothing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>). The notion that he here alludes to the meaning of his own name (<span class="accented">Paulus</span>, connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "little") is very unlikely. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a> he goes further, and calls himself "less than the least of all saints," though even there he claims to have been the special apostle of the Gentiles. <span class="cmt_word">Because I persecuted the Church of God.</span> This was the one sin for which, though he knew that God had forgiven him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>), yet he could never quite forgive himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>). In my 'Life of St. Paul' I have shown from the language used, that this persecution was probably more deadly than has been usually supposed, involving not only torture, but actual bloodshed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1</a>), besides the martyrdom of St. Stephen. We can imagine how such deeds and such scenes would, even after forgiveness, lie like sparks of fire in a sensitive conscience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Saints, did I say? with your remembered faces;<br />Dear men and women whom I sought and slew?<br />Oh, when I meet you in the heavenly places,<br />How will I weep to Stephen and to you!"</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-11 The word resurrection, usually points out our existence beyond the grave. Of the apostle's doctrine not a trace can be found in all the teaching of philosophers. The doctrine of Christ's death and resurrection, is the foundation of Christianity. Remove this, and all our hopes for eternity sink at once. And it is by holding this truth firm, that Christians stand in the day of trial, and are kept faithful to God. We believe in vain, unless we keep in the faith of the gospel. This truth is confirmed by Old Testament prophecies; and many saw Christ after he was risen. This apostle was highly favoured, but he always had a low opinion of himself, and expressed it. When sinners are, by Divine grace, turned into saints, God causes the remembrance of former sins to make them humble, diligent, and faithful. He ascribes to Divine grace all that was valuable in him. True believers, though not ignorant of what the Lord has done for, in, and by them, yet when they look at their whole conduct and their obligations, they are led to feel that none are so worthless as they are. All true Christians believe that Jesus Christ, and him crucified, and then risen from the dead, is the sun and substance of Christianity. All the apostles agreed in this testimony; by this faith they lived, and in this faith they died.</body></html>
