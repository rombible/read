"For," he had already said to the Thessalonians, "if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him" (see the same argument in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That there is no resurrection of the dead.</span> These deniers of the resurrection are usually called "the Corinthian Sadducees."

Yet it comes with something of a shock on our paralyzed sense of astonishment to read that some of these Christians actually denied a resurrection! The fact at once proves two remarkable truths, namely, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the early Christian Church had none of the ideal purity of doctrine which is sometimes ecclesiastically attributed to it; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there was in the bosom of that Church a wide and most forbearing tolerance. We have no data to enable us to determine what were the influences which led to the denial of the resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> They can hardly have been Jewish. The mass of Jews at this time shared the views of the Pharisees, who strongly maintained the resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>). If they were Jews at all, they could only have been Sadducees or Essenes. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">Sadducees</span> were a small, wealthy, and mainly political sect, who had no religious influence, and can certainly have had no representatives at Corinth; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Essenes</span>, though they had considerable influence in Asia, do not seem to have established themselves in Greece, nor are we aware that they were hostile to the doctrine of the resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Probably, then, they were Gentiles. If so, they may have been <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> either <span class="accented">Epicureans</span>, who disbelieved in a future life altogether; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Stoics</span>, who held that the future life was only an impersonal absorption into the Divine. Both these schools of philosophers "jeered" at the very notion of a bodily resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-32.htm">Acts 17:32</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-18.htm">2 Timothy 2:18</a> we read of some, like Hymenaeus and Philetus, who erred, saying "that the resurrection was past already." These teachers were incipient Gnostics, who <span class="accented">spiritualized</span> the resurrection, or rather said that the term was <span class="accented">only</span> applicable to the rising from the death of sin to the life of righteousness. The Corinthian doubters seem from the arguments which St. Paul addresses to them, to have been rather troubled with <span class="accented">material</span> doubts which they may have inherited from their Gentile training. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:12-19 Having shown that Christ was risen, the apostle answers those who said there would be no resurrection. There had been no justification, or salvation, if Christ had not risen. And must not faith in Christ be vain, and of no use, if he is still among the dead? The proof of the resurrection of the body is the resurrection of our Lord. Even those who died in the faith, had perished in their sins, if Christ had not risen. All who believe in Christ, have hope in him, as a Redeemer; hope for redemption and salvation by him; but if there is no resurrection, or future recompence, their hope in him can only be as to this life. And they must be in a worse condition than the rest of mankind, especially at the time, and under the circumstances, in which the apostles wrote; for then Christians were hated and persecuted by all men. But it is not so; they, of all men, enjoy solid comforts amidst all their difficulties and trials, even in the times of the sharpest persecution.</body></html>
