Its sting is sin. If there were no sin, death would not be capable of inflicting pain, and the strength of sin springs from the fact that it is the violation of God's law. (See this thought fully brought out, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 56.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sting of death is sin.</span> Because death is the wages of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Death is represented as a venomous serpent. <span class="cmt_word">The strength of sin is the Law.</span> The best comment on this expression is to be found in the Epistle to the Romans; see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-10.htm">Romans 7:10-12</a>. It must be admitted that this passing allusion to a distinct doctrine does not seem, at first sight, to harmonize with the glorious unity of the subject. No one can read it without a slight sense of <span class="accented">jar</span>, because it seems to introduce the element of dogmatic controversy. But this sense of incongruity is removed when we remember how intensely St. Paul felt that man is confronted with the horror of a broken Law, which at once reminds him of a Being infinitely holy, and of his own self condemnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>.). It is the sense that the Law in its deathful aspect is annulled, and the sinful soul delivered, which prompts the outburst of the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:51-58 All the saints should not die, but all would be changed. In the gospel, many truths, before hidden in mystery, are made known. Death never shall appear in the regions to which our Lord will bear his risen saints. Therefore let us seek the full assurance of faith and hope, that in the midst of pain, and in the prospect of death, we may think calmly on the horrors of the tomb; assured that our bodies will there sleep, and in the mean time our souls will be present with the Redeemer. Sin gives death all its hurtful power. The sting of death is sin; but Christ, by dying, has taken out this sting; he has made atonement for sin, he has obtained remission of it. The strength of sin is the law. None can answer its demands, endure its curse, or do away his own transgressions. Hence terror and anguish. And hence death is terrible to the unbelieving and the impenitent. Death may seize a believer, but it cannot hold him in its power. How many springs of joy to the saints, and of thanksgiving to God, are opened by the death and resurrection, the sufferings and conquests of the Redeemer! In verse 58, we have an exhortation, that believers should be stedfast, firm in the faith of that gospel which the apostle preached, and they received. Also, to be unmovable in their hope and expectation of this great privilege, of being raised incorruptible and immortal. And to abound in the work of the Lord, always doing the Lord's service, and obeying the Lord's commands. May Christ give us faith, and increase our faith, that we may not only be safe, but joyful and triumphant.</body></html>
