The deacons used to baptise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-48.htm" title="And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.">Acts 10:48</a>). The mention of "the preaching of the glad tidings" affords an opportunity for the Apostle stating in vindication of himself why that, and not philosophy, was the subject of his preaching, <span class= "ital">"</span>lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect." Such, and not inability or ignorance, was the grand cause of his simplicity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sent me not to baptize,</span> but; that is, according to Semitic idiom, "not so much to baptize, as" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The word "sent" (<span class="accented">apesteilen</span>) involves the meaning "made me an apostle" (<span class="accented">apostolos</span>). The primary function of the apostles was "to bear witness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To preach the gospel.</span> St. Paul again "goes off" at this word, and dwells for eight verses on the character of his preaching. <span class="cmt_word">Not in wisdom of words;</span> not, that is, in a philosophic and oratorical style. The simplicity of the style and teaching of the apostles awoke the sneers of philosophers like Celsus and Porphyry. <span class="cmt_word">The cross of Christ</span>. The central doctrine of Christianity, the preaching of a crucified Redeemer. <span class="cmt_word">Should be made void.</span> The rendering of the Authorized Version is too strong; the cross cannot "be made of none effect." The word means "should be emptied" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-3.htm">2 Corinthians 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-14.htm">Romans 4:14</a>); made void of its special and independent power. The words, "the cross of Christ," form the emphatic end of the sentence in the Greek. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Paul had been bred up in Jewish learning; but the plain preaching of a crucified Jesus, was more powerful than all the oratory and philosophy of the heathen world. This is the sum and substance of the gospel. Christ crucified is the foundation of all our hopes, the fountain of all our joys. And by his death we live. The preaching of salvation for lost sinners by the sufferings and death of the Son of God, if explained and faithfully applied, appears foolishness to those in the way to destruction. The sensual, the covetous, the proud, and ambitious, alike see that the gospel opposes their favourite pursuits. But those who receive the gospel, and are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see more of God's wisdom and power in the doctrine of Christ crucified, than in all his other works. God left a great part of the world to follow the dictates of man's boasted reason, and the event has shown that human wisdom is folly, and is unable to find or retain the knowledge of God as the Creator. It pleased him, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe. By the foolishness of preaching; not by what could justly be called foolish preaching. But the thing preached was foolishness to wordly-wise men. The gospel ever was, and ever will be, foolishness to all in the road to destruction. The message of Christ, plainly delivered, ever has been a sure touchstone by which men may learn what road they are travelling. But the despised doctrine of salvation by faith in a crucified Saviour, God in human nature, purchasing the church with his own blood, to save multitudes, even all that believe, from ignorance, delusion, and vice, has been blessed in every age. And the weakest instruments God uses, are stronger in their effects, than the strongest men can use. Not that there is foolishness or weakness in God, but what men consider as such, overcomes all their admired wisdom and strength.</body></html>
