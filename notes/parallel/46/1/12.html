The following words, "every one of you saith," show how party-spirit pervaded the whole Christian community. It may be well to mention here briefly what we may consider to have been the distinctive characteristics of the factions which called themselves respectively the party of Paul, of Cephas, of Apollos, and of Christ.<p>1. ST. PAUL places first that section of the Church which called themselves by his name--thus at the outset showing that it is not for the sole purpose of silencing opponents, or from a jealousy of the influence of other teachers, that he writes so strenuously against the disturbances in the Corinthian community. It is the spirit of separation and of faction which he condemns--rebuking it as strongly when it has led to the undue exaltation of his own name, as when it attempted to depreciate his gifts and ministry as compared with those of Apollos or of Cephas. He thus wins at once the attention and confidence of every candid reader. The Pauline party would no doubt have consisted chiefly of those who were the personal converts of the Apostle. Their esteem for him who had been the means of their conversion, seems to have been carried to excess in the manner in which it displayed itself. This would be increased by the hostility which their opponents' disparagement of the Apostle naturally excited in them. They allowed St. Paul's teaching of the liberty wherewith Christ made them free, to develop in them an unchristian license and a mode of treatment of others essentially illiberal, thus denying by their actions the very principles which they professed to hold dear. They "judged" and "set at nought" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm" title="But why do you judge your brother? or why do you set at nothing your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.">Romans 14:10</a>) brethren who could not take so essentially spiritual a view of Christianity, but who still clung to some of the outward forms of Judaism.<p>2. APOLLOS was a Jew of Alexandria--"an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures." He came to Ephesus during St. Paul's absence from that city, and taught what he knew of the "things of the Lord." While here, he was instructed further in "the way of God" by Aquila and Priscilla, he having previously only the inadequate knowledge which was possessed by disciples of John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-24.htm" title="And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.">Acts 18:24-28</a>). Having preached in parts of Achaia, he came to Corinth. That he came there after St. Paul we may conclude from the Apostle's reference to himself as having "planted," and Apollos having "watered" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.">1Corinthians 3:6</a>), and again to himself as having "laid the foundation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.">1Corinthians 2:10</a>). To Corinth Apollos brought with him the arts of the rhetorician, and the culture of a Greek philosopher; and while preaching Christ crucified, these gifts and knowledge rendered him more acceptable than St. Paul had been, with his studied simplicity of style, to a certain class of intellectual and rationalising hearers in Corinth. When Apollos left, a section of the Church unduly magnified the importance of his gifts and of his manner of teaching. They did so to the depreciation of the simplicity of the gospel. This all led to the development of evils which we shall see more in detail in our examination of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.">1Corinthians 1:18-31</a> and 1 Corinthians 2. It ought to be remembered that Apollos was in no sense "the founder of a party." It was the exaggeration and perversion of Apollos' teaching, by some of the converts, that really founded the party. To the end he and Paul remained friends. He was probably with the Apostle while the Epistle was being written, and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1Corinthians 16:12</a>) refused, even when St. Paul suggested it, to go so soon again to Corinth, lest his presence should in the least tend to keep that party-spirit alive; and when, ten years (A.D. 67) later, the Apostle writes to Titus, he exhorts him "to bring Apollos on his journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm" title="Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to them.">Titus 3:13</a>).<p>3. The third faction in Corinth professed themselves followers of ST. PETER--or, as he was always <span class= "ital">called,</span> "Cephas." This was the name by which our Lord addressed him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>, and by this name (and not by his Greek name, Peter) he would have been spoken of by the Apostles and early Christians. In the New Testament writings he is designated most frequently Peter, as his Greek name would be more intelligible to the larger world for which these writings were intended. This faction of the Corinthian Church still clung to many Jewish ceremonial ideas, from which St. Paul was entirely free. They seem not to have quite passed <span class= "ital">through</span> the cloud. They exalted St. Peter as more worthy of honour than St. Paul, because he had personally been with Christ, and been called "Cephas" (<span class= "ital">rock</span>) by Him. They insinuated that St. Paul's supporting himself was not so dignified as the maintenance of St. Peter and others by the Church, in accordance with their Lord's command (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Have we not power to eat and to drink?">1Corinthians 9:4-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9-10</a>); and they unfavourably contrasted St. Paul's celibacy with the married state of St. Peter, and of "the brethren of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?">1Corinthians 9:5</a>). It is probable that their animosity towards St. Paul was not a little increased by the knowledge that there were certain matters in which he considered St. Peter to be in error, and <span class= "ital">"</span>withstood him to the face" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>). To the detailed difficulties and errors of this section of the Corinthian Church reference is to be found in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.">1Corinthians 7:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1Corinthians 11:1</a>.<p>4. There was still one other party or faction which dared to arrogate to themselves the name of CHRIST Himself. These over-estimated the importance and value of having seen Christ in the flesh, and despised St. Paul as one who had subsequently joined the Apostolate. Contempt for all human teachers was by them exalted into a virtue. Their greatest sin was that the very name which should have been the common bond of union, the name by the thought and memory of which the Apostle would plead for a restoration of unity, was degraded by them into the exclusive party-badge of a narrow section. We do not find any very definite and detailed allusion to this section in this Epistle, though in the second Epistle a reference to them can be traced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.">1Corinthians 10:7</a>. There is no need for such at any length. Their condemnation is written in every chapter, the whole of the Epistle is a denunciation of the spirit of faction--of the sin of schism--which in their case reached a climax, inasmuch as they consecrated their sin with the very name of Christ. Such, briefly, were the four schisms which were rending the Corinthian Church. We might call them--1, The Party of Liberty (PAUL); 2, The Intellectual Party (APOLLOS); 3, The Judaizing Party (CEPHAS); 4, The Exclusive Party (who said, "I am of CHRIST").<p>(12) <span class= "bld">I of Christ.</span>--It has been suggested that this is not the designation of a fourth party in the Church, but an affirmation by the Apostle, "I am of Christ," in contradistinction to those referred to before, who called themselves after the names of men. But in addition to the fact that there is no change in form of expression to indicate a change of sense, we find evident traces of the existence of such a party (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.">2Corinthians 10:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now this I mean;</span> in other words, "what I mean is this." Their "contentions" are defined to be equivalent to "religious partisanships; "antagonistic adoption of the names and views of special teachers. Each <span class="cmt_word">one of you</span> saith. That party spirit ran so high that they were all listed on one side or another. None of them were wise enough and spiritual minded enough to hold aloof from parties altogether. They prided themselves on being "uncompromising" and "party men." <span class="accented">Saith</span>; in a self-assertive way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am of Paul.</span> He shows his indignation at their partisanship by first rebuking those who had used <span class="accented">his own name</span> as a party watchward. He disliked Paulinism as much as Petrinism (Bengel). All the Corinthians would probably have been in this sense Paulinists but for the visits of subsequent teachers. At present the Paul party consisted of those who adhered to his views about Gentile freedom, and who liked the simple spirituality of his teaching. St. Paul rose above the temptation of considering that party spirit is excusable in our own partisans. He reproves factiousness even in the party of freedom. <span class="cmt_word">And I of Apollos.</span> Apollos personally was absolutely loyal and honourable, but his visit to Corinth had done mischief. His impassioned oratory, his Alexandrian refinements, his allegorizing exegesis, the culture and polish of his style, had charmed the fickle Corinthians. The Apollonians were the party of culture. They had, as we see from later parts of the Epistle, exaggerated St. Paul's views, as expounded by Apollos, into extravagance. Puffed up with the conceit of knowledge, they had fallen into moral inconsistency. The egotism of oratorical rivals, the contemptuous tone to wards weaker brethren, the sophistical condonations of vice, were probably due to them. Apollos, as we see by his noble refusal to visit Corinth under present circumstances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>), was as indignant as St. Paul himself at the perversion of his name into an engine of party warfare. (On Apollos, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>.) Nothing further is known respecting him, but he is the almost undoubted author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which proves that he was of the school of St. Paul, while at the same time he showed a splendid originality in his way of arriving at the same conclusion as his teacher. <span class="cmt_word">I of Cephas</span>. The use of the Aramaic name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>), perhaps, shows that these Petrinists were Judaizers (though it should be added that St. Paul only uses the name "Peter" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7, 8</a>). They personally disliked St. Paul, and questioned his apostolical authority. Perhaps the extravagances of the "speaking with tongues" arose in this party, who recalled the effects of the outpouring of the Spirit after Peter's great sermon on the day of Pentecost. <span class="cmt_word">And I of Christ.</span> We trace the origin of this party to one man in particular (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>), who was, or professed to be, an adherent of James, and therefore one of the more rigid Judaizers. He may have been one from the circle of Christ's earthly relatives - one of the Desposyni (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>), and, like St. James, may have had views resembling those of the Essenes and Ebionites. If so, he was probably the author of the questions about celibacy and marriage; and perhaps he prided himself on having seen "Christ in the flesh." This party at any rate, like some modern sects, was not ashamed to degrade into a party watchword even the sacred name of Christ, and to claim for a miserable clique an exclusive interest in the Lord of the whole Church. It is the privilege of every Christian to say, "Christianus sum;" but if he says it in a haughty, loveless, and exclusive spirit, he forfeits his own claim to the title. This exclusive Christ party is, perhaps, specially alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm">2 Corinthians 10:7-11</a>. The view of Chrysostom, which takes these words to be St. Paul's remark - "But I belong to Christ," is untenable, and would make trim guilty of the very self-assertiveness which he is reprobating. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-16 In the great things of religion be of one mind; and where there is not unity of sentiment, still let there be union of affection. Agreement in the greater things should extinguish divisions about the lesser. There will be perfect union in heaven, and the nearer we approach it on earth, the nearer we come to perfection. Paul and Apollos both were faithful ministers of Jesus Christ, and helpers of their faith and joy; but those disposed to be contentious, broke into parties. So liable are the best things to be corrupted, and the gospel and its institutions made engines of discord and contention. Satan has always endeavoured to stir up strife among Christians, as one of his chief devices against the gospel. The apostle left it to other ministers to baptize, while he preached the gospel, as a more useful work.</body></html>
