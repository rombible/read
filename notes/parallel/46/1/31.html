Our only true boasting before God is that we are in Christ, that all we have we owe entirely to Him; we can only glory in, not ourselves or what we have or are, but in the fact that He is our benefactor. Thus, in St. Chrysostom's quaint words, Paul "always fasteneth them on with nails to the name of Christ."<p>This concludes St. Paul's general explanation of God's method, and he then turns to his own conduct, to show how entirely it was in harmony with God's plan, which he has just explained and vindicated.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As it is written.</span> A compressed quotation from the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Let him glory in the Lord.</span> The word rendered "glory" is more literally, <span class="accented">boast.</span> The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a> (LXX.). The prevalence of "boasting" among the Corinthians and their teachers drove St. Paul to dwell much on this word - from which he so greatly shrinks - in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>. (where the word occurs twenty times), and to insist that the only true object in which a Christian can glory is the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>), not in himself, or in the world, or in men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26-31 God did not choose philosophers, nor orators, nor statesmen, nor men of wealth, and power, and interest in the world, to publish the gospel of grace and peace. He best judges what men and what measures serve the purposes of his glory. Though not many noble are usually called by Divine grace, there have been some such in every age, who have not been ashamed of the gospel of Christ; and persons of every rank stand in need of pardoning grace. Often, a humble Christian, though poor as to this world, has more true knowledge of the gospel, than those who have made the letter of Scripture the study of their lives, but who have studied it rather as the witness of men, than as the word of God. And even young children have gained such knowledge of Divine truth as to silence infidels. The reason is, they are taught of God; the design is, that no flesh should glory in his presence. That distinction, in which alone they might glory, was not of themselves. It was by the sovereign choice and regenerating grace of God, that they were in Jesus Christ by faith. He is made of God to us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; all we need, or can desire. And he is made wisdom to us, that by his word and Spirit, and from his fulness and treasures of wisdom and knowledge, we may receive all that will make us wise unto salvation, and fit for every service to which we are called. We are guilty, liable to just punishment; and he is made righteousness, our great atonement and sacrifice. We are depraved and corrupt, and he is made sanctification, that he may in the end be made complete redemption; may free the soul from the being of sin, and loose the body from the bonds of the grave. And this is, that all flesh, according to the prophecy by Jeremiah, Jer 9:23-24, may glory in the special favour, all-sufficient grace, and precious salvation of Jehovah.</body></html>
