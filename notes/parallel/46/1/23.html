The notion of a suffering and humiliated Messiah, who reduced them to the level of all God's other children, was to them "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>). These two verses, translated into Syriac, furnish a marked play on words (<span class="accented">miscol</span>, stumbling block; <span class="accented">mashcal</span>, folly; <span class="accented">seed</span>, cross); and some have seen in this a sign that St. Paul <span class="accented">thought</span> in Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Greeks;</span> rather, <span class="accented">unto Gentiles</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, I). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Jews... unto the Greeks.</span> Both alike had failed. The Jew had not attained ease of conscience or moral perfectness; the Greek had. not unriddled the secret of philosophy; yet both alike rejected the peace and the enlightenment which they had professed to seek. <span class="cmt_word">Foolishness</span>. The accent of profound contempt is discernible in all the early allusions of Greeks and Romans to Christianity. The only epithets which they could find for it were "execrable," "malefic," "depraved," "damnable" (Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny, etc.). The milder term is "excessive superstition." The heroic constancy of martyrs appeared even to M. Aurelius only under the aspect of a "bare obstinacy." The word used to express the scorn of the Athenian philosophers for St. Paul's "strange doctrine" is one of the coarsest disdain (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and they called him "a seed pecker" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-18.htm">Acts 17:18, 32</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a mere picker up of "learning's crumbs." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Paul had been bred up in Jewish learning; but the plain preaching of a crucified Jesus, was more powerful than all the oratory and philosophy of the heathen world. This is the sum and substance of the gospel. Christ crucified is the foundation of all our hopes, the fountain of all our joys. And by his death we live. The preaching of salvation for lost sinners by the sufferings and death of the Son of God, if explained and faithfully applied, appears foolishness to those in the way to destruction. The sensual, the covetous, the proud, and ambitious, alike see that the gospel opposes their favourite pursuits. But those who receive the gospel, and are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see more of God's wisdom and power in the doctrine of Christ crucified, than in all his other works. God left a great part of the world to follow the dictates of man's boasted reason, and the event has shown that human wisdom is folly, and is unable to find or retain the knowledge of God as the Creator. It pleased him, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe. By the foolishness of preaching; not by what could justly be called foolish preaching. But the thing preached was foolishness to wordly-wise men. The gospel ever was, and ever will be, foolishness to all in the road to destruction. The message of Christ, plainly delivered, ever has been a sure touchstone by which men may learn what road they are travelling. But the despised doctrine of salvation by faith in a crucified Saviour, God in human nature, purchasing the church with his own blood, to save multitudes, even all that believe, from ignorance, delusion, and vice, has been blessed in every age. And the weakest instruments God uses, are stronger in their effects, than the strongest men can use. Not that there is foolishness or weakness in God, but what men consider as such, overcomes all their admired wisdom and strength.</body></html>
