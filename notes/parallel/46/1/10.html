The treatment of this subject occupies to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-20.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.">1Corinthians 4:20</a>. It is important to remember that the factions rebuked by St. Paul were not sects who separated themselves from the Church, but those who within the Church divided themselves into parties, each calling itself by the name of some Apostle whose teaching and practice were most highly esteemed. The nature and cause of these divisions we shall understand as we consider the Apostle's exhortation to unity, and his rebuke of the spirit which gave rise to them.<p><span class= "bld">By the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>--By his previous remark that they had been called unto "the communion" of this Holy Name, the writer has led up to the mention of Christ's name--not in the form of an adjuration, but as reminding them of it. That very name adds strength to his exhortation to "speak the same thing"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to call themselves by this one name, and not each (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>) by a different designation, and that there should be no "schisms" among them. The word translated "divisions," signifies literally a "rent," in which sense it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-21.htm" title="No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.">Mark 2:21</a> ("<span class= "ital">the rent</span> is made worse"), and is used three times in St. John's Gospel in the sense of schism or difference of opinion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-43.htm" title="So there was a division among the people because of him.">John 7:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-19.htm" title="There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.">John 10:19</a>). See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-43.htm" title="So there was a division among the people because of him.">John 7:43</a>, as to the moral application of the word having probably come from Ephesus; and the idea of a tear or rent is carried on in the words, "be perfectly joined together," which in the original signifies the repair of something which was torn, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a> we have the word rendered "<span class= "ital">were mending</span> their nets." The church at Corinth presents to the Apostle's mind the idea of a seamless robe rent and torn into pieces, and he desires its complete and entire restoration by their returning to a united temper of mind and judgment as to word and deed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-17.</span> - <span class="accented">Party spirit at Corinth.</span> This subject is pursued in various forms to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>. The particle implies the transition from thanksgiving to reproof. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren</span>. This very title involves an appeal to them to aim at unity among themselves; and St. Paul, like St. James (James 5:10), uses it to soften any austerity which might seem to exist in his language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Through the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> that is, by the whole idea of Christ's being and office - the strongest bond of union between true Christians (see the powerful appeal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye all speak the same thing;</span> that is, "that ye may all with one mind and one mouth glorify God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>). They were doing the very reverse - each glorifying himself and his party (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_word">Divisions</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); "schisms" used of bodies within the Church, not of separatists from it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>). The word is only used in this special sense in this Epistle. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-16.htm">Matthew 9:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-21.htm">Mark 2:21</a> <span class="accented">schisma</span> means "a rent;" in John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-43.htm">John 7:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-19.htm">John 10:19</a>), "a division of opinion." There would be little or no harm in the <span class="accented">schismata</span> so far as they affected unessential points, if it was not their fatal tendency to end in "contentions" (<span class="accented">erides</span>) and "factions" (<span class="accented">haireseis</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>). Corinth was a place where such divisions would be likely to spring up, partly from the disputatious vivacity and intellectual conceits of the inhabitants, partly from the multitudes of strangers who constantly visited the port, partly from the numerous diversities of previous training through which the various sections of converts had passed. <span class="cmt_word">Perfected together;</span> literally, <span class="accented">repaired, reunited.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In the same mind and in the same judgment</span>; that is, in what they think and believe (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>), and in what they assert and do (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x1fc3;</span>). The exhortation, "be of one mind," in every sense of the word, was as necessary in the ancient as in the modern Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-16 In the great things of religion be of one mind; and where there is not unity of sentiment, still let there be union of affection. Agreement in the greater things should extinguish divisions about the lesser. There will be perfect union in heaven, and the nearer we approach it on earth, the nearer we come to perfection. Paul and Apollos both were faithful ministers of Jesus Christ, and helpers of their faith and joy; but those disposed to be contentious, broke into parties. So liable are the best things to be corrupted, and the gospel and its institutions made engines of discord and contention. Satan has always endeavoured to stir up strife among Christians, as one of his chief devices against the gospel. The apostle left it to other ministers to baptize, while he preached the gospel, as a more useful work.</body></html>
