Omitting the word "and," the sentence is not an addition to the things already mentioned, but a general and emphatic summary of all the things which have been already contrasted with their opposites. After the words "hath God chosen" there is a slight pause, and then the Apostle describes all those things which he has declared to be God's choice, as things which "are not"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> do not in men's estimation even exist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-17.htm" title="(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.">Romans 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-25.htm" title="As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.">Romans 9:25</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-19.htm" title="How much less to him that accepts not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.">Job 34:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-24.htm" title="He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.">Job 34:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the base things;</span> literally, <span class="accented">low-born, unborn</span>; "those who are sprung kern no one in <span class="accented">particular" - nullo patre, nullis majoribus.</span> Nothing could be more ignoble in the eyes of the world than a cross of wood upheld by feeble hands, and yet before it <span class="accented">"kings</span> and their armies did flee and were discomfited, and they of the household divided the spoil." <span class="cmt_word">And the things that are not</span>. The <span class="accented">not</span> is the Greek subjective negative (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>); things of which men conceived as not existing - "nonentities." It is like the expression of Clement of Rome, "Things <span class="accented">accounted as</span> nothing." Christianity was "the little stone, cut without hands," which God called into existence. We find the same thought in St. John the Baptist's sermon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26-31 God did not choose philosophers, nor orators, nor statesmen, nor men of wealth, and power, and interest in the world, to publish the gospel of grace and peace. He best judges what men and what measures serve the purposes of his glory. Though not many noble are usually called by Divine grace, there have been some such in every age, who have not been ashamed of the gospel of Christ; and persons of every rank stand in need of pardoning grace. Often, a humble Christian, though poor as to this world, has more true knowledge of the gospel, than those who have made the letter of Scripture the study of their lives, but who have studied it rather as the witness of men, than as the word of God. And even young children have gained such knowledge of Divine truth as to silence infidels. The reason is, they are taught of God; the design is, that no flesh should glory in his presence. That distinction, in which alone they might glory, was not of themselves. It was by the sovereign choice and regenerating grace of God, that they were in Jesus Christ by faith. He is made of God to us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; all we need, or can desire. And he is made wisdom to us, that by his word and Spirit, and from his fulness and treasures of wisdom and knowledge, we may receive all that will make us wise unto salvation, and fit for every service to which we are called. We are guilty, liable to just punishment; and he is made righteousness, our great atonement and sacrifice. We are depraved and corrupt, and he is made sanctification, that he may in the end be made complete redemption; may free the soul from the being of sin, and loose the body from the bonds of the grave. And this is, that all flesh, according to the prophecy by Jeremiah, Jer 9:23-24, may glory in the special favour, all-sufficient grace, and precious salvation of Jehovah.</body></html>
