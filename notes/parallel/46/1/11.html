Her name was evidently well known to the Corinthians, and some slaves of her household, probably travelling between Ephesus and Corinth, on their owner's business, had brought to St. Paul the account of the distracted state of the church in their city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It hath been signified unto me.</span> He had heard these saddening rumours towards the close of his stay in Ephesus. <span class="cmt_word">By them</span> which are of the household of <span class="cmt_word">Chloe</span>. The Greek only has "by them of Chloe. St. Paul wisely and kindly mentions his <span class="accented">authority</span> for these reports. Nothing is known of Chloe or her household. It has been conjectured that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, Corinthians who were now with St. Paul at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-16.htm">1 Corinthians 16:16</a>), may have been Chloe's slaves or freedmen. <span class="cmt_word">Contentions.</span> These are the works of the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>). The condition of the Church was the same when St. Clement of Rome wrote to them. He had still to complain of the "strange and alien and, for the elect of God, detest able and unholy spirit of faction which a few rash and self willed persons kindled to such a pitch of dementation" ('Ep. ad Corinthians 1.'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-16 In the great things of religion be of one mind; and where there is not unity of sentiment, still let there be union of affection. Agreement in the greater things should extinguish divisions about the lesser. There will be perfect union in heaven, and the nearer we approach it on earth, the nearer we come to perfection. Paul and Apollos both were faithful ministers of Jesus Christ, and helpers of their faith and joy; but those disposed to be contentious, broke into parties. So liable are the best things to be corrupted, and the gospel and its institutions made engines of discord and contention. Satan has always endeavoured to stir up strife among Christians, as one of his chief devices against the gospel. The apostle left it to other ministers to baptize, while he preached the gospel, as a more useful work.</body></html>
