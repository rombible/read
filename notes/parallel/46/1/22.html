It pandered neither to Jewish-minded persons (not in the Greek "<span class= "ital">the</span> Jews," <span class= "ital">"the</span> Gentiles," but simply "Jews," "Gentiles") who desired visible portents to support the teaching, nor to those of Greek taste who desired an actual and clear philosophic proof of it. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm" title="Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you.">Matthew 12:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm" title="And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.">Mark 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-16.htm" title="And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.">Luke 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-48.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Except you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.">John 4:48</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jews ask for signs;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Jews demand signs.</span> This had been their incessant demand during our Lord's ministry; nor would they be content with any sign short of a sign from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>: 16:1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-48.htm">John 4:48</a>, etc.). This had been steadily refused them by Christ, who wished them rather to see spiritual signs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-20.htm">Luke 17:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Greeks seek after wisdom.</span> St. Paul at Athens had found himself surrounded with Stoics and Epicureans, and the same new thing which every one was looking for mainly took the shape of philosophic novelties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-21.htm">Acts 17:21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Paul had been bred up in Jewish learning; but the plain preaching of a crucified Jesus, was more powerful than all the oratory and philosophy of the heathen world. This is the sum and substance of the gospel. Christ crucified is the foundation of all our hopes, the fountain of all our joys. And by his death we live. The preaching of salvation for lost sinners by the sufferings and death of the Son of God, if explained and faithfully applied, appears foolishness to those in the way to destruction. The sensual, the covetous, the proud, and ambitious, alike see that the gospel opposes their favourite pursuits. But those who receive the gospel, and are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see more of God's wisdom and power in the doctrine of Christ crucified, than in all his other works. God left a great part of the world to follow the dictates of man's boasted reason, and the event has shown that human wisdom is folly, and is unable to find or retain the knowledge of God as the Creator. It pleased him, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe. By the foolishness of preaching; not by what could justly be called foolish preaching. But the thing preached was foolishness to wordly-wise men. The gospel ever was, and ever will be, foolishness to all in the road to destruction. The message of Christ, plainly delivered, ever has been a sure touchstone by which men may learn what road they are travelling. But the despised doctrine of salvation by faith in a crucified Saviour, God in human nature, purchasing the church with his own blood, to save multitudes, even all that believe, from ignorance, delusion, and vice, has been blessed in every age. And the weakest instruments God uses, are stronger in their effects, than the strongest men can use. Not that there is foolishness or weakness in God, but what men consider as such, overcomes all their admired wisdom and strength.</body></html>
