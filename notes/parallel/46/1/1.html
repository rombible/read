After the beginning of the first missionary journey (A.D. 45) he seems to have finally abandoned his Hebrew name of Saul. Called. The word "called" is absent from A, D, E, and other manuscripts, but may have been omitted as superfluous. It occurs in the greeting of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>, but not in any other Epistle. The words might also be rendered "a called or chosen apostle." To be an apostle. He uses this title in every letter except the private one to Philemon, the peculiarly friendly and informal one to the Philippians, and the two to the Thessalonians, which were written before the Judaizers had challenged his claim to this title in its more special sense. The Epistle to the Romans is the first in which he calls himself "a <span class="accented">slave</span> of Jesus Christ" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1.htm">Jude 1</a>). It was necessary for him to assert his right to the apostolate in the highest sense of the word, as one who had received from Christ himself an authority equal to that of the twelve (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1-19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Of Jesus Christ.</span> In the Gospels the word "Christ" is all but invariably "<span class="accented">the</span> Christ," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Anointed, the Messiah. It is the designation of the office of Jesus as the promised Deliverer. We trace in the New Testament the gradual transition of the word from a title into a proper name. In the two names together our Lord is represented as "the Saviour," and the anointed Prophet, Priest, and King, first of the chosen people and then of all mankind. <span class="cmt_word">Through the will of God</span> (comp. 2 Corinthians 1 Ephesians Colossians <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>). This <span class="accented">special</span> call to the apostleship is emphatically expanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>. The vindication of the Divine and independent claim was essential to St. Paul's work. It was not due to any personal considerations, but to the necessity of proving that no human authority could be quoted to overthrow the gospel which was peculiarly "his gospel" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>), of which one main feature was the freedom of the Gentiles from the yoke of Judaic bondage. And Soathenes. The association of one or more brethren with himself in the greeting of his letters is peculiar to St. Paul. Silas and Timothy are associated with him in 1 and 2 Thessalonians; and Timothy, though so much his junior, in 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon; doubtless he would have been associated with St. Paul in this Epistle had he not been absent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>). The practice arose partly from St. Paul's exquisite courtesy and consideration towards his companions, partly from his shrinking from mere personal prominence. It is owing to the same reasons that in the earlier Epistles he constantly uses "we" for "I," and sometimes when he can only be speaking of himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>). But even in the Epistles to the Thessalonians he sometimes relapses from "we" into "I" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>). Our brother; literally, the <span class="accented">brother</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of <span class="accented">"the</span> brethren" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>). Of Sosthenes nothing whatever is known. He may possibly be the amanuensis whom St. Paul employed for this letter. Later tradition, which in such matters is perfectly valueless, spoke of him as" one of the seventy disciples, and Bishop of Colophon" (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 1:12). There is a Jewish Sosthenes, a ruler of the synagogue, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-17.htm">Acts 18:17</a>; but it is only a vague conjecture that he may have been subsequently converted, and may have joined St. Paul at Ephesus. It is obvious that the persons named in the greetings of the Epistles were not in any way supposed to be responsible for their contents, lot St. Paul begins with "I" in ver. 4. <span class="accented">Brother.</span> At this time there was no recognized title for Christians. In the Acts they are vaguely spoken of as "those of this way." Among themselves they were known as "the saints," "the faithful," "the elect." The name "Christians" was originally a nickname devised by the Antiochenes. In the New Testament it only occurs as a designation used by enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 All Christians are by baptism dedicated and devoted to Christ, and are under strict obligations to be holy. But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!</body></html>
