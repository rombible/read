It has been well remarked, "the ancient Christians were, for the greater part, slaves and persons of humble rank; the whole history of the progress of the Church is in fact a gradual triumph of the unlearned over the learned, of the lowly over the great, until the emperor himself cast his crown at the foot of Christ's cross" (Olshausen); or, as an English writer puts it, "Christianity with the irresistible might of its weakness shook the world."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-31.</span> - <span class="accented">The method of God in the spread of the gospel.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For behold;</span> or, <span class="accented">consider</span> (imperative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-15.htm">1 Corinthians 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Your calling;</span> the nature and method of your heavenly calling; the "principle God has followed in calling you" (Beza); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Not many wise after the flesh.</span> Those who hear the calling arc alone the truly wise; but they are net wise with a carnal wisdom, not wise as men count wisdom; they have but little of the wisdom of the serpent and the wisdom of "this age." The Sanhedrin looked down on the apostles as "unlearned and ignorant men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>). <span class="accented">"God,"</span> says St. Augustine, "caught orators by fishermen, not fishermen by orators." <span class="cmt_word">Not many mighty</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not many persons of power and influence. Almost the first avowed Gentile Christian of the highest rank was the consul Flavius Clemens, uncle of the Emperor Domitian. This was the more marked because <span class="accented">the Jews</span> won many rich and noble proselytes, such as the Queen Helena and the royal family of Adiabene, Poppaea the wife of Nero, and others. The only illustrious converts mentioned in the New Testament are Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, Sergius Paulus, and Dionysius the Areopagitc. <span class="cmt_word">Not many noble.</span> All this was a frequent taunt against Christians, but they made it their boast. Christianity came to redeem and elevate, not the few, but the many, and the many must ever be the weak and the humble. Hence Christ called fishermen as his apostles, and was known as "the Friend of publicans and sinners." None of the rulers believed on him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-48.htm">John 7:48</a>). It must, however, be borne in mind that these words apply mainly and primarily to the first age of Christianity. It was essential that its victory should be due to Divine weapons only, and that it should shake the world "by the irresistible might of weakness." After a time, the wisest and the noblest and the most powerful were called. Kings became the nursing fathers of the gospel, and queens its nursing mothers. Yet the ideal truth remains, and human power shows utter weakness, and human wisdom is capable of sinking into the depths of folly. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26-31 God did not choose philosophers, nor orators, nor statesmen, nor men of wealth, and power, and interest in the world, to publish the gospel of grace and peace. He best judges what men and what measures serve the purposes of his glory. Though not many noble are usually called by Divine grace, there have been some such in every age, who have not been ashamed of the gospel of Christ; and persons of every rank stand in need of pardoning grace. Often, a humble Christian, though poor as to this world, has more true knowledge of the gospel, than those who have made the letter of Scripture the study of their lives, but who have studied it rather as the witness of men, than as the word of God. And even young children have gained such knowledge of Divine truth as to silence infidels. The reason is, they are taught of God; the design is, that no flesh should glory in his presence. That distinction, in which alone they might glory, was not of themselves. It was by the sovereign choice and regenerating grace of God, that they were in Jesus Christ by faith. He is made of God to us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; all we need, or can desire. And he is made wisdom to us, that by his word and Spirit, and from his fulness and treasures of wisdom and knowledge, we may receive all that will make us wise unto salvation, and fit for every service to which we are called. We are guilty, liable to just punishment; and he is made righteousness, our great atonement and sacrifice. We are depraved and corrupt, and he is made sanctification, that he may in the end be made complete redemption; may free the soul from the being of sin, and loose the body from the bonds of the grave. And this is, that all flesh, according to the prophecy by Jeremiah, Jer 9:23-24, may glory in the special favour, all-sufficient grace, and precious salvation of Jehovah.</body></html>
