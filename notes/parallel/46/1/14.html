For if he had baptised a great many, some might have said he had created originally a party in his own name. Crispus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-8.htm" title="And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.">Acts 18:8</a>), a "ruler of the synagogue," Gaius (or Caius, his Roman name), "mine host, and of the whole Church" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>): the evident importance and position of these two, and that they were the first converts, may account for the Apostle having departed from his usual practice in baptising them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I thank God that I baptized none of you</span>. St. Paul, in his characteristic manner, "goes off at the word" <span class="accented">baptize. He</span> thanked God, not by way of any disparagement to baptism, but because he had thus given no excuse to the undue exaltation of his own name. Compare the practice of our Lord himself, in leaving his disciples to baptize (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a>). The apostles would not have approved the system of wholesale baptisms of the heathen which has prevailed in some Romanist missions. <span class="cmt_word">Save Crispus.</span> The ruler of the synagogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-8.htm">Acts 18:8</a>). Doubtless there were some strong special reasons why, in these instances, St. Paul departed from his general rule of not personally baptizing his converts. <span class="cmt_word">And Gaius</span>. Gaius of Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>). It was one of the commonest of names. There was another Gaius of Derbe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>), and another known to St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-1.htm">3 John 1:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-16 In the great things of religion be of one mind; and where there is not unity of sentiment, still let there be union of affection. Agreement in the greater things should extinguish divisions about the lesser. There will be perfect union in heaven, and the nearer we approach it on earth, the nearer we come to perfection. Paul and Apollos both were faithful ministers of Jesus Christ, and helpers of their faith and joy; but those disposed to be contentious, broke into parties. So liable are the best things to be corrupted, and the gospel and its institutions made engines of discord and contention. Satan has always endeavoured to stir up strife among Christians, as one of his chief devices against the gospel. The apostle left it to other ministers to baptize, while he preached the gospel, as a more useful work.</body></html>
