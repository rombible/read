From chrio; Anointed One, i.e. The Messiah, an epithet of Jesus.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Who.</span>--The use of the words "day of our Lord Jesus Christ," instead of "His day," has been regarded by some as a sufficient evidence that "who" does not refer to Christ. This by itself would scarcely be so, for there are examples elsewhere of St. Paul using our Lord's name where the possessive pronoun would have seemed more natural (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>). The general sense of the passage, however, and especially of the following verse, shows that the antecedent to "who" is not "Christ," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm" title="So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1Corinthians 1:7</a>, but "God," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;">1Corinthians 1:4</a>.<p>Three distinct periods are referred to in these verses--(1) the time when the grace of God was given them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;">1Corinthians 1:4</a>); (2) the present time while they wait for the coming of the Lord Jesus, endowed as they are with the qualities described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1Corinthians 1:5-7</a>; and (3) the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is still future--if preserved blameless until that, then they are finally and for ever safe; and that they will be so preserved by God the Apostle has no doubt, for the reason stated in the next verse. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-3.htm" title="But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.">1Corinthians 4:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Who</span>; clearly Christ, though his Name is again repeated in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">Shall also confirm you.</span> This natural expression of the apostle's yearning hope for them must not be overpressed into any such doctrine as "the indefectibility of grace." All honest and earnest students must resist the tendency to strain the meaning of Scripture texts into endless logical inferences which were never intended to be deduced from them. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the end;</span> namely, to the end of "this age," and to the coming of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11</a>). That ye be unreprovable; rather, <span class="accented">unimpeached</span> (<span class="accented">anenkletous</span>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a>:18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>.

A Christian can only be "blameless," not as being sinless, but as having been forgiven, renewed, sanctified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> This is the same as the <span class="accented">apokalypsis</span> or <span class="accented">parousia.</span> It is sometimes called simply "the day" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 All Christians are by baptism dedicated and devoted to Christ, and are under strict obligations to be holy. But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!</body></html>
