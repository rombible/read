"World" (more literally, <span class= "ital">age</span>) does not here mean the physical world, but, in an ethical sense, "this age," in contrast to that which is "to come" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm" title="And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.">Matthew 12:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-30.htm" title="But he shall receive an hundred times now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.">Mark 10:30</a>). It is employed afterwards (last word of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?">1Corinthians 1:20</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm" title="For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.">1Corinthians 1:21</a>) to designate all who are outside the Christian communion, as in the next verse it is contrasted with "them that believe."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where is the wise?</span> etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-18.htm">Isaiah 33:18</a>); rather, <span class="accented">Where is a wise man?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a scribe, etc., which is even more incisive. These questions are triumphant, like the "Where is the King of Hamath and of Arpad?" The same impassioned form of speech recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>. The questions would come home to the Jews, who regarded their rabbis and the "pupils of the wise as exalted beings who could look down on all poor ignorant persons (<span class="accented">amharatsim</span>, or "people of the land"); and to the Greeks, who regarded none but the philosophers as "wise." <span class="cmt_word">The scribe</span>. With the Jews of that day" the scribe" was" the theologian," the ideal of dignified learning and orthodoxy, though for the most part he mistook elaborate ignorance for profound knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">The disputer.</span> The word would specially suit the disputatious Greeks, clever dialecticians. The verb from which this word is derived occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11</a>, and the abstract substantive ("an eager discussion") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-29.htm">Acts 28:29</a>. If St. Paul has <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-18.htm">Isaiah 33:18</a> in his mind, the word "disputer" corresponds to "the counter of the towers" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-12.htm">Psalm 48:12</a>). Even the rabbis say that when Messiah comes human wisdom is to become needless. <span class="cmt_word">Of the world;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of this age</span>, or <span class="accented">aeon.</span> The old dispensation, then so rapidly waning to its close, was called "this age" (<span class="accented">olam hazzeh</span>); the next or Messianic age was called "the age to come" (<span class="accented">olam habba</span>). The Messianic age had dawned at the birth of Christ, but the old covenant was not finally annulled till his second coming at the fall of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Did not God</span> (by the cross) <span class="accented">stultify the wisdom</span>, etc.? The oxymoron, or sharp contrast of terms - a figure of which St. Paul is fond (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-6.htm">1 Timothy 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, etc.; and my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:628) - is here clearly marked in the Greek. The thought was as familiar to the old prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>) as to St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22</a>); and even Horace saw that heathen philosophy was sometimes no better than <span class="accented">insaniens sapientia</span> (Horace, 'Od.,' 1:34, 2). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Paul had been bred up in Jewish learning; but the plain preaching of a crucified Jesus, was more powerful than all the oratory and philosophy of the heathen world. This is the sum and substance of the gospel. Christ crucified is the foundation of all our hopes, the fountain of all our joys. And by his death we live. The preaching of salvation for lost sinners by the sufferings and death of the Son of God, if explained and faithfully applied, appears foolishness to those in the way to destruction. The sensual, the covetous, the proud, and ambitious, alike see that the gospel opposes their favourite pursuits. But those who receive the gospel, and are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see more of God's wisdom and power in the doctrine of Christ crucified, than in all his other works. God left a great part of the world to follow the dictates of man's boasted reason, and the event has shown that human wisdom is folly, and is unable to find or retain the knowledge of God as the Creator. It pleased him, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe. By the foolishness of preaching; not by what could justly be called foolish preaching. But the thing preached was foolishness to wordly-wise men. The gospel ever was, and ever will be, foolishness to all in the road to destruction. The message of Christ, plainly delivered, ever has been a sure touchstone by which men may learn what road they are travelling. But the despised doctrine of salvation by faith in a crucified Saviour, God in human nature, purchasing the church with his own blood, to save multitudes, even all that believe, from ignorance, delusion, and vice, has been blessed in every age. And the weakest instruments God uses, are stronger in their effects, than the strongest men can use. Not that there is foolishness or weakness in God, but what men consider as such, overcomes all their admired wisdom and strength.</body></html>
