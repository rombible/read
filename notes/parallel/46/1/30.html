He is the author of the spiritual life of us who are in union with Christ, "who <span class= "ital">was</span> (not "is") made wisdom unto us <span class= "ital">from</span> God." The past tense here refers us back to the fact of the Incarnation; in it Christ became to us God's revelation of Himself, thus giving us a wisdom from the source of all wisdom, which surpasses utterly any wisdom we could have derived from nature or from man. Not only is Christ the source of whatever true wisdom we have, but also (so adds the Apostle) of whatever "righteousness" and "holiness" we have--spiritual gifts, as well as gifts of knowledge, come all from Him--and beyond all that, He is also our redemption, the "ransom" paid for us, by which we are redeemed from the bondage and slavery of sin. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.">John 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-18.htm" title="Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of righteousness.">Romans 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-20.htm" title="For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.">Romans 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18-19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But of him are ye in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="accented">Ye</span> do not belong to the wise and noble.

The text is a singularly full statement of the whole result of the work of Christ. as the source of "all spiritual blessings in things heavenly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>), in whom we are complete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). "Jehovah-tsidkenu - the Lord our Righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>). This is the theme of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-7.htm">Romans 3:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Sanctification</span> (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25, 26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Redemption</span>. One of the four main metaphors by which the atonement is described is this of ransom (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). The meaning and nature of the act, <span class="accented">as regards God</span>, lie in regions above our comprehension; so that all speculations as to the person to whom the ransom was paid, and the reason why it was indispensable, have only led to centuries of mistaken theology. But the meaning and nature of it, <span class="accented">as regards man</span>, is our deliverance from bondage, and the payment of the debt which we had incurred (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21-23</a>). In all these cases, as Stanley well observes, the words have a double meaning - both of an inward act and of an outward result. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:26-31 God did not choose philosophers, nor orators, nor statesmen, nor men of wealth, and power, and interest in the world, to publish the gospel of grace and peace. He best judges what men and what measures serve the purposes of his glory. Though not many noble are usually called by Divine grace, there have been some such in every age, who have not been ashamed of the gospel of Christ; and persons of every rank stand in need of pardoning grace. Often, a humble Christian, though poor as to this world, has more true knowledge of the gospel, than those who have made the letter of Scripture the study of their lives, but who have studied it rather as the witness of men, than as the word of God. And even young children have gained such knowledge of Divine truth as to silence infidels. The reason is, they are taught of God; the design is, that no flesh should glory in his presence. That distinction, in which alone they might glory, was not of themselves. It was by the sovereign choice and regenerating grace of God, that they were in Jesus Christ by faith. He is made of God to us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; all we need, or can desire. And he is made wisdom to us, that by his word and Spirit, and from his fulness and treasures of wisdom and knowledge, we may receive all that will make us wise unto salvation, and fit for every service to which we are called. We are guilty, liable to just punishment; and he is made righteousness, our great atonement and sacrifice. We are depraved and corrupt, and he is made sanctification, that he may in the end be made complete redemption; may free the soul from the being of sin, and loose the body from the bonds of the grave. And this is, that all flesh, according to the prophecy by Jeremiah, Jer 9:23-24, may glory in the special favour, all-sufficient grace, and precious salvation of Jehovah.</body></html>
