He thus shows that he is not blind to, or forgetful of, their good qualities, although this Epistle is specially written to rebuke their present sins; and also that he is not about to utter words of hopeless condemnation, but of wholesome warning. The emphatic use of the singular, <span class= "ital">I</span> thank <span class= "ital">my</span> God, in contrast to the plural in the previous verses, indicates that St. Paul does not join Sosthenes with him as author of the Epistle, but that it is written in his name alone and with his sole authority.<p><span class= "bld">The grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the grace of God given you in Christ Jesus</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> given to you as being in Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-9.</span> - The <span class="accented">thanksgiving.</span> The thanksgiving is a feature in almost every Epistle of St. Paul, except the Epistle to the Galatians, in which he plunges at once into severe reprobation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I thank my God.</span> It is probable, from papyrus rolls in the British Museum, that the general form and outline of letters was more or less conventional. In St. Paul, however, this thanksgiving is the natural overflow of a full heart. It was no mere compliment or rhetorical artifice like the <span class="accented">captatio benevolentiae</span>, or endeavouring to win the hearers by flattery, which we find in most ancient speeches. <span class="accented">My God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Always</span>; that is, constantly; on all occasions of special prayer. He could still thank God for them, though his letter was written "with many tears" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the grace of God.</span> The grace (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of spiritual life showing itself in many special spiritual gifts (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), such as "the gift of tongues." <span class="cmt_word">Which was given you.</span> This is one of St. Paul's "baptismal aorists." He always regards and speaks of the life of the soul as summed up potentially in one supreme moment and crisis - namely, the moment of conversion and baptism. The grace given once was given for ever, and was continually manifested. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ Jesus.</span> St. Paul regarded the life of the Christian as "hid with Christ in God," and of Christ as <span class="accented">being</span> the Christian's life (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 All Christians are by baptism dedicated and devoted to Christ, and are under strict obligations to be holy. But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!</body></html>
