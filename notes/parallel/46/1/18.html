To them it was foolishness, because it requires spiritual discernment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>); and, on the other hand, human wisdom is foolishness with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Foolishness</span>. It shows the heroic character of the faith of St. Paul that he deliberately preached the doctrine of the cross because he felt that therein lay the conversion and salvation of the world, although he was well aware that he could preach no truth so certain at first to revolt the unregenerate hearts of his hearers. To the Jews "the cross" was the tree of shame and horror; and a crucified person was "accursed of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). To the Greeks the cross was the gibbet of a slave's infamy and a murderer's punishment. There was not a single association connected with it except those of shame and agony. The thought of "a crucified Messiah" seemed to the Jews a revolting folly; the worship of a crucified malefactor seemed to the Greeks "an execrable superstition" (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 15:44; Pliny, 'Epp.' 10:97); yet so little did St. Paul seek for popularity or immediate success, that this was the very doctrine which he put in the forefront, even at a city so refined and so voluptuous as Corinth. And the result proved his inspired wisdom. That very cross became the recognized badge of Christianity, and when three centuries had elapsed it was woven in gold upon the banners and set in jewels on the diadems of the Roman empire. For had not Christ prophesied, And I, <span class="accented">if I be lifted up</span>, will draw all men unto me"? <span class="cmt_word">Unto us which are being saved;</span> who are on the way of salvation. The same present participle is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>. It is the power of God. Because the cross is at the heart of that gospel which is "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>), though many were tempted to be ashamed of it. It could never be a carnal weapon of warfare, and yet was mighty for every purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4, 5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Paul had been bred up in Jewish learning; but the plain preaching of a crucified Jesus, was more powerful than all the oratory and philosophy of the heathen world. This is the sum and substance of the gospel. Christ crucified is the foundation of all our hopes, the fountain of all our joys. And by his death we live. The preaching of salvation for lost sinners by the sufferings and death of the Son of God, if explained and faithfully applied, appears foolishness to those in the way to destruction. The sensual, the covetous, the proud, and ambitious, alike see that the gospel opposes their favourite pursuits. But those who receive the gospel, and are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see more of God's wisdom and power in the doctrine of Christ crucified, than in all his other works. God left a great part of the world to follow the dictates of man's boasted reason, and the event has shown that human wisdom is folly, and is unable to find or retain the knowledge of God as the Creator. It pleased him, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe. By the foolishness of preaching; not by what could justly be called foolish preaching. But the thing preached was foolishness to wordly-wise men. The gospel ever was, and ever will be, foolishness to all in the road to destruction. The message of Christ, plainly delivered, ever has been a sure touchstone by which men may learn what road they are travelling. But the despised doctrine of salvation by faith in a crucified Saviour, God in human nature, purchasing the church with his own blood, to save multitudes, even all that believe, from ignorance, delusion, and vice, has been blessed in every age. And the weakest instruments God uses, are stronger in their effects, than the strongest men can use. Not that there is foolishness or weakness in God, but what men consider as such, overcomes all their admired wisdom and strength.</body></html>
