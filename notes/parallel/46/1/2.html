The term "saints" is never used by St. Paul with its restricted modern meaning, but is applied to the whole baptised Church. The English word which most nearly expresses the apostolic idea is "Christians"--used in its most comprehensive sense.<p><span class= "bld">With all that in every place.</span>--Better translated, <span class= "ital">with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours.</span> The teaching of the Epistle is thus addressed to the Church at large, which is composed of all who call upon the Lord Jesus, whether it be in Corinth ("our" country--the Apostle identifying himself with his converts) or elsewhere. This idea of the Church, put forward in the very opening of the Epistle, at once directs the reader's mind from the narrow spirit of faction which was exhibiting itself at Corinth. The words of this verse contain a strong testimony to the worship of Christ, not only as being practised in the Apostolic Church, but as being one of the very marks of true union with the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Church.</span> This form of address is used in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. In St. Paul's later Epistles, for some unknown reason, he prefers the address "to the saints." These forms of address show the absence of any fixed ecclesiastical government. He does not in this Epistle address any "bishops" or "presbyters" whom he might regard as responsible for the growing disorders which prevailed at Corinth, but he appeals to the whole Church. The word <span class="accented">ecclesia</span> - signifying those who were "called out of the world," and so primarily applied to "the congregation of Israel" - came ultimately to mean "a congregation." The only apostle who uses the word "synagogue" of the Christian assemblies is St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of God.</span> Not the Church of this or that party leader. Some commentators give to these words an emphasis and importance which does not seem to belong to them. <span class="cmt_word">Which is at Corinth.</span> So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-2.htm">2 Corinthians 1:2</a>. In 1 and 2 Thessalonians he prefers the form, "the Church of the <span class="accented">Thessalonians."</span> "The Church at Corinth" was an expression which involved the sharpest of contrasts. It brought into juxtaposition the holiest ideal of the new faith and the vilest degradations of the old paganism. It was "a glad and great paradox" (Bengel). The condition of society at Corinth, at once depraved and sophistical, throws light on many parts of the Epistle. Cicero describes the city as <span class="accented">"illus</span>trious a like for <span class="accented">wantonness</span>, opulence, and the study of philosophy." <span class="cmt_word">Even them that are sanctified.</span> The apostles could only write to Churches as being <span class="accented">really</span> Churches, and to Christians as being true Christians. In all general addresses they could only assume that the <span class="accented">actual</span> resembled the <span class="accented">ideal.</span> They never conceal the immense chasm which separated the real condition of many members of their Churches from the vocation which they professed. They <span class="accented">knew</span> also that it is (as Calvin says) "a perilous temptation to refuse the name of Church to every Church in which there is not perfect purity." Ideally even the Corinthian Christians were redeemed by Christ's expiation, consecrated and sanctified by the work of the Holy Spirit. They could only be addressed in accordance with their ostensible position (see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3:1; 5:68). Our Prayer book is constructed on the same principle. The harvest is still a harvest, though amongst the corn there may be many tares. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ Jesus</span>. The words, "in Christ," constitute what has been happily called "the monogram of St. Paul." The life of the true Christian is no longer his own. The Christ for him has become the Christ <span class="accented">in</span> him. His natural life is merged into a higher spiritual life. Baptized <span class="accented">into</span> Christ, he has become one with Christ. Called to be saints. (On this Christian calling, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm">2 Peter 1:10</a>.) They are called to be united saints, not schismatic partisans or members of antagonistic cliques. The description of what they were <span class="accented">ideally</span> is the more emphatic because he feels how much they had fallen away. <span class="cmt_word">With all that... in every place.</span> Perhaps this may mean the same as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>, "With all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia;" or the words may imply that St. Paul's exhortations are applicable to all Christians, wherever they may be and (as is expressed in the next clause) whatever may be their varying shades of individual opinion. It was well in any case to remind the Corinthians that they formed but a fraction of the Christian communities. Catholicity, not provincialism, makes the true Church of God. <span class="cmt_word">Call upon the Name.</span> The Greek verb is here in the middle voice, not "who are called by the Name"(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>, LXX.). It means, therefore, all who reverence the Name of Christ, all who adore their one "Lord" in the fulness of his nature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-5.htm">Joel 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10.htm">Romans 10</a>:24; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, etc.); in other words, "all who profess and call themselves Christians" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their Lord and ours</span>. I connect these words, not with "place," as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">In omni loco ipsorum et nostro -</span> which, however it may be twisted, can give no good sense - but with "Jesus Christ." It has been in all ages a fatal temptation of party Christians to claim a monopoly of Christ for themselves and their own sects, as though <span class="accented">they</span> only taught the gospel, and were the <span class="accented">only</span> Christians or the <span class="accented">only</span> "Evangelicals." But Christ cannot thus be "parcelled into fragments" (see vers. 12, 13), nor has any party a right to boast exclusively, "I am of Christ." The addition, "and ours," could not be regarded as super fluous in writing to a Church of which one section wanted to assert an exclusive right in Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 All Christians are by baptism dedicated and devoted to Christ, and are under strict obligations to be holy. But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!</body></html>
