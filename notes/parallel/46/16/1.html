The collection for the poor at Jerusalem.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1Corinthians 16:5-9</a>. The Apostle's prospective arrangement, as to his journey.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10-18</a>. Commendation of various individuals.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1Corinthians 16:19-20</a>. The salutation of the Church.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-21.htm" title="The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.">1Corinthians 16:21-24</a>. The salutation of Paul himself.<p>From the fact of a necessity existing for a collection for the poor Christians at Jerusalem, it is clear that the community of goods (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm" title="And all that believed were together, and had all things common;">Acts 2:44</a>) which had at the beginning been established in that Church had not proved successful. Christianity was largely recruited from the lower classes, especially in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-6.htm" title="But you have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?">James 2:6</a>), and a common fund would not long have flourished with so few contributors and such a multitude of sharers. Moreover, the many who were shut up in prison had perhaps by this time been released in abject poverty, and would naturally be the subject of anxious solicitation to one who was identical with "persecuting Saul," who "had given his voice against them," and against others now dead. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-10.htm" title="Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.">Acts 26:10</a>.) It is to be noticed that the Apostle does not speak of them as "the poor," but as "saints." That was the true ground of their claim upon their brethren.<p><span class= "bld">As I have given order to the churches of Galatia.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">As</span> <span class= "ital">I</span> <span class= "ital">gave order to the churches of Galatia.</span> The order was definitely given by the Apostle in person when visiting these churches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>). It does not occur in his Epistle to that Church. On this passage Bengel's Note is worth quoting--"He proposes the Galatians as an example to the Corinthians, the Corinthians to the Macedonians, and the Corinthians and Macedonians to the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2Corinthians 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>). Great is the power of examples."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-18.</span> - <span class="accented">Directions and arrangements.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now concerning the collection for the saints.</span> "The saints" are here the poor Christians at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>). The subject weighed much on St. Paul's mind. First, there was real need for their charity, for at Jerusalem there was as sharp a contrast between the lots of the rich and poor as there is in London, and the "poor saints," being the poorest of the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>), must have often been in deep distress. Not many years before this time, in the famine of Claudius, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27-30</a>), Queen Helena of Adiabene had kept the paupers of Jerusalem alive by importing cargoes of dried grapes and figs. Besides the periodical famines, the political troubles of Judaea had recently increased the general distress. Secondly, the tender heart of St. Paul was keenly alive to this distress. Thirdly, it was the only way in which the Gentile Churches could show their gratitude to the mother Church. Lastly, the Apostle St. Paul had solemnly promised the apostles at Jerusalem that he would remember the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>). Hence he frequently alludes to this collection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8, 9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>, etc.). The enthusiastic communism of the earliest Christian society in Jerusalem had soon ceased, being, as all experience proves, an impossible experiment under the conditions which regulate all human life, and it may have aggravated the chronic distress. <span class="cmt_word">As I have given order;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as I arranged.<span class="cmt_word"></span> To the Churches of Galatia.</span> Not in his extant letter to the Galatians, but either in a visit three years before this time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>), or by letter. It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10</a> that St. Paul had already asked for the contributions of the Corinthians. "To the Corinthians he proposes the example of the Galatians; to the Macedonians the example of the Corinthians; to the Romans that of the Macedonians and Corinthians. Great is the power of example" (Bengel). <span class="cmt_word">Even so do ye.</span> The aorist implies that they should do it at once. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The good examples of other Christians and churches should rouse us. It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.</body></html>
