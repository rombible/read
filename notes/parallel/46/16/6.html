Whither he would go from Corinth he had not yet determined; and, indeed, it was subsequently determined for him by a conspiracy against him, which was fortunately discovered in time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-3.htm" title="And there stayed three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.">Acts 20:3</a>). He remained three mouths at Corinth, during winter, and, as that brought him to a time of year when a voyage would be safe, he resolved to sail into Syria. The conspiracy of the Jews caused this plan to be abandoned, and a different course, through Troas, &c., adopted. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-13.htm" title="And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.">Acts 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-17.htm" title="And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.">Acts 20:17</a>.) The phrase "that ye may send me on" implies not merely that Corinth should be the starting-point of his journey to Jerusalem, but that he should set out on that journey with the good wishes and blessing of his Corinthian friends (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-38.htm" title="Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.">Acts 20:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-5.htm" title="And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.">Acts 21:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and winter with you.</span> This he did (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye may bring me on my journey.</span> The "ye" is emphatic. The acceptance of this favour at their hands was a proof of affection. It was the custom in ancient days to accompany a departing guest for a short distance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-24.htm">Romans 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm">Acts 17:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whithersoever I go.</span> St. Paul well knew that some uncertainty must attach to his plans. As it was, he had to change his plan at the last moment. He had meant to sail from Corinth, but, owing to a plot to assassinate him, he was obliged to go overland round by Macedonia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>). Ver. 7 - <span class="cmt_word">For I will not see you now by</span> the way; rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">do not wish to pay you a cursory visit now</span>, as I had originally meant to do. <span class="cmt_word">If the Lord permit.</span> The Christians made a rule of adding these phrases in sign of dependence upon God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4.htm">2 Corinthians 4</a>:19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-3.htm">Hebrews 6:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The good examples of other Christians and churches should rouse us. It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.</body></html>
