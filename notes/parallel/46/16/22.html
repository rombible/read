Do they love the Lord Jesus? The word here used for love signifies not merely affectionate regard, but personal devotion.<p><span class= "bld">Let him be Anathema Maran-atha.</span>--Better <span class= "ital">Let him be Anathema. Maranatha.</span> There is no connection between these two words. <span class= "ital">Anathema</span> signifies "accursed." The absence of love to Christ is condemnation. The word <span class= "ital">Maranatha</span> is a Syriac expression--"the Lord is at hand," or "the Lord is come;" probably the former. The uncertainty of the moment when the Lord may come is the most solemn thought with which to remind them of the importance of being one with Christ. Stanley gives the following interesting Note:--"The name Maronite is sometimes explained by a tradition that the Jews in their expectation of the Messiah were constantly saying, <span class= "ital">Maran </span>(Lord). To which the Christians answered, <span class= "ital">Maranatha</span> (The Lord is come), why do you expect Him? Hence the name, '<span class= "ital">Maronite</span>' is applied to the Jews, especially Spanish Jews and Moors who confessed <span class= "ital">Maran,</span> but not <span class= "ital">Maranatha."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man love not,</span> etc. This sentence (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>) is part of the autograph salutation. The verb here used for "love" (<span class="accented">philo</span>) was perhaps suggested by the word for "kiss" (<span class="accented">philema</span>). The word generally used for "love of God" is <span class="accented">agapae</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>), which implies less warmth, but deeper reverence. But this passage is full of emotion. <span class="cmt_word">Let him be Anathema.</span> The word only occurs elsewhere in 1 Corinthians 12:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-13.htm">Acts 23:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-74.htm">Matthew 26:74</a>, "to curse"). It is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">cherem</span>, a ban (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-29.htm">Leviticus 27:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>, etc.). I cannot pretend to understand what St. Paul means by it, unless it be "Let personal love to Christ be the <span class="accented">essential</span> of Christian fellowship, and let him who has it not be regarded <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">apart from the Church."</span> Commentators call it "an imprecation," or "malediction," and say that it means "Let him be devoted to God's wrath and judgment." That language is, indeed, very like the language of religious hatred and religious usurpation in all ages, but it is the very antithesis to the general tone of the apostle. <span class="accented">If</span> this were the meaning, it would seem to resemble the very spirit which Christ himself severely rebuked as the Elijah spirit, not the Christ spirit. But I do not believe that, even in a passing outburst of strong emotion, St. Paul had any such meaning. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Jews used <span class="accented">cherem</span>, not only of the severer form of excommunication (<span class="accented">shem atha</span>), but even of the milder and by no means severe <span class="accented">temporary</span> form (<span class="accented">nidui</span>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it cannot be <span class="accented">more</span> severe than "handing over to Satan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>), which was merciful in its purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Maran-atha;</span> two words, <span class="accented">the Lord cometh</span>; like the Jewish <span class="accented">shem atha</span>, "the Name cometh," or, "the Lord comes." It seems to be an appeal to the judgment of Christ, and may possibly have been an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>, the words with which the Old Testament ends (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-14.htm">Jude 1:14, 15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:19-24 Christianity by no means destroys civility. Religion should promote a courteous and obliging temper towards all. Those give a false idea of religion, and reproach it, who would take encouragement from it to be sour and morose. And Christian salutations are not mere empty compliments; but are real expressions of good-will to others, and commend them to the Divine grace and blessing. Every Christian family should be as a Christian church. Wherever two or three are gathered together in the name of Christ, and he is among them, there is a church. Here is a solemn warning. Many who have Christ's name much in their mouths, have no true love to him in their hearts. None love him in truth, who do not love his laws, and keep his commandments. Many are Christians in name, who do not love Christ Jesus the Lord in sincerity. Such are separated from the people of God, and the favour of God. Those who love not the Lord Jesus Christ, must perish without remedy. Let us not rest in any religious profession where there is not the love of Christ, earnest desires for his salvation, gratitude for his mercies, and obedience to his commandments. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ has in it all that is good, for time and for eternity. To wish that our friends may have this grace with them, is wishing them the utmost good. And this we should wish all our friends and brethren in Christ. We can wish them nothing greater, and we should wish them nothing less. True Christianity makes us wish those whom we love, the blessings of both worlds; this is meant in wishing the grace of Christ to be with them. The apostle had dealt plainly with the Corinthians, and told them of their faults with just severity; but he parts in love, and with a solemn profession of his love to them for Christ's sake. May our love be with all who are in Christ Jesus. Let us try whether all things appear worthless to us, when compared with Christ and his righteousness. Do we allow ourselves in any known sin, or in the neglect of any known duty? By such inquiries, faithfully made, we may judge of the state of our souls.</body></html>
