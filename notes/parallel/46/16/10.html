As, however, they would travel through Macedonia, delaying <span class= "ital">en route</span> at the various churches to prepare them for the visit which St. Paul, according to his then intention, purposed paying them after he had been to Corinth, they possibly might not reach Corinth until after this Epistle, which would be carried thither by a more direct route. The Apostle was evidently anxious to know how Timothy would be received by the Corinthians. He was young in years. He was young also in the faith. He had probably a constitutionally weak and timid nature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a>), and he was of course officially very subordinate to St. Paul. In a Church, therefore, some of whose members had gone so far as to question, if not actually to repudiate the authority even of the Apostle himself, and to depreciate him as compared with the elder Apostles, there was considerable danger for one like Timothy. By reminding the Corinthians of the work in which Timothy is engaged, and of its identity with his own work, the Apostle anticipates and protests against any insult being offered to Timothy, because of what a great English statesman once called, in reference to himself, "the atrocious crime of being a young man."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now if Timotheus come.</span> St. Paul bad already sent on Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>), with Erastus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>), to go to Corinth by way of Macedonia, and prepare for his visit. But possibly he had <span class="accented">countermanded</span> these directions when he postponed his own visit. In the uncertainties of ancient travelling, be could not be certain whether his counter order would reach Timothy or not. It appears to have done so, for nothing is said of any visit of Timothy to Corinth, and St. Paul sent Titus. <span class="cmt_word">Without fear.</span> Timothy must at this time have been very young (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). As a mere substitute for St. Paul's personal visit, he would be unacceptable. In every allusion to him we find traces of a somewhat timid and sensitive disposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6-8</a>, etc.). He may well, therefore, have shrunk from the thought of meeting the haughty sophisters and disputatious partisans of Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">As I also do.</span> "As a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>). St. Paul felt for Timothy a deeper personal tenderness than for any of his other friends, and the companionship of this gentle and devoted youth was one of the chief comforts of his missionary labour. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:10-12 Timothy came to do the work of the Lord. Therefore to vex his spirit, would be to grieve the Holy Spirit; to despise him, would be to despise Him that sent him. Those who work the work of the Lord, should be treated with tenderness and respect. Faithful ministers will not be jealous of each other. It becomes the ministers of the gospel to show concern for each other's reputation and usefulness.</body></html>
