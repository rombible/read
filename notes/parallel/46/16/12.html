St. Paul had planted, Apollos had watered that Church, and in the absence of the planter, Apollos would have been the most likely and proper person to exercise authority there. The unselfish consideration of St. Paul is equalled by the thoughtful reluctance of Apollos, who fears that his presence might encourage the one faction, and perhaps embitter the other, and he declines, not considering it a "convenient" time to do so. In the thought of these teachers "convenient" meant the good of Christ's Church, and not the ease or comfort of any individual man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As touching our brother Apollos;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but as touching Apollos, the brother.</span> It seems clear from this that the Corinthians, in their letter, had requested that this eloquent and favourite teacher might be sent to them. <span class="cmt_word">I greatly desired him to come unto you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">besought him much.</span> There were at Corinth persons malignant enough to have suggested that Paul had refused their request; that he would not send Apollos to them out of jealousy of Apollos's superior oratory, and of the party which assumed his name. St. Paul anticipated this sneer. His nature was much too noble to feel the least jealousy. Both he and Apollos here show themselves in the purest light. <span class="cmt_word">His will;</span> literally, <span class="accented">there was not will.</span> The word "will" most frequently means "the will <span class="accented">of God,"</span> but if that had been the meaning here, the word would have had the article. It is used of human will in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-37.htm">1 Corinthians 7:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>. Here it means that Apollos had decided not to come at present, obviously because his name had been abused for purposes of party faction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a>). This was all the more noble on his part because he seems to have been a special friend of Titus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>). St. Paul would gladly have sent his two ablest and most energetic disciples to this distracted Church. <span class="cmt_word">When he shall have convenient time;</span> rather, <span class="accented">when a good opportunity offers itself to him.</span> Whether Apollos ever revisited Corinth or not we do not know. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:10-12 Timothy came to do the work of the Lord. Therefore to vex his spirit, would be to grieve the Holy Spirit; to despise him, would be to despise Him that sent him. Those who work the work of the Lord, should be treated with tenderness and respect. Faithful ministers will not be jealous of each other. It becomes the ministers of the gospel to show concern for each other's reputation and usefulness.</body></html>
