St. Paul would not take this money himself. His "religious" enemies were many, bitter, and unscrupulous, and he would give them no possibility of a handle against him. He makes such arrangements as should place him above suspicion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20</a>). It turned out that the subscription was an adequate one, and St. Paul accompanied the Corinthian delegates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). The thought that they might visit Jerusalem and see some of the twelve would act as an incentive to the Corinthians. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The good examples of other Christians and churches should rouse us. It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.</body></html>
