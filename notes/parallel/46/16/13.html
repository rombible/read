It is possible that they conclude the epistle so far--the Apostle intending to add immediately before sending it, the verses which follow, and which contain messages from, or commendations of their friends who were with him. Living in a profound consciousness of the uncertainty of life, St. Paul might wish not to have such references to friends with him added until the last moment along with his own autograph (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-21.htm" title="The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.">1Corinthians 16:21</a>). The Apostle's mind is full of the hope of beneficial results following from this letter and from the exertions of Titus; yet, after all, everything depends upon the Corinthians themselves. Chrysostom's Note on these words brings out their meaning well. "Now in saying these things, he seems indeed to advise; but he is reprimanding them as indolent. Wherefore he saith, <span class= "ital">Watch,</span> as though they slept; <span class= "ital">stand,</span> as though they were rocking to and fro; <span class= "ital">quit you like men,</span> as though they were playing the coward; <span class= "ital">let all your things be done with charity,</span> as though they were in dissensions. And the first caution refers to the deceivers, viz., <span class= "ital">Watch, stand;</span> the next to those who plot against us, <span class= "ital">quit you like men;</span> the third to those who make parties and endeavour to distract, <span class= "ital">let all your</span> <span class= "ital">things be done with charity,</span> which thing is the bond of perfection, and the root and the fountain of all blessings."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Watch</span>, etc. The brief impetuous imperatives show a sudden burst of emotion as he draws to a close. The next clause seems like an after-thought. Watchfulness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-2.htm">Revelation 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>), steadfastness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>), and strength (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a>), and love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>, etc.) were frequent subjects of Christian exhortation. The verb which expresses Christian manliness ("Play the men!") occurs here only. It is found in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>. They needed, as Chrysostom says, all these exhortations, for they were, in Christian matters, drowsy, unstable, effeminate, and factions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:13-18 A Christian is always in danger, therefore should ever be on the watch. He should be fixed in the faith of the gospel, and never desert or give it up. By this faith alone he will be able to keep his ground in an hour of temptation. Christians should be careful that charity not only reigns in their hearts, but shines in their lives. There is a great difference between Christian firmness and feverish warmth and transport. The apostle gave particular directions as to some who served the cause of Christ among them. Those who serve the saints, those who desire the honour of the churches, and to remove reproaches from them, are to be thought much of, and loved. They should willingly acknowledge the worth of such, and all who laboured with or helped the apostle.</body></html>
