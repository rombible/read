It was probably now about Easter-time (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-7.htm" title="For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.">1Corinthians 16:7</a>), and the hostility of enemies increases. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9-23</a>.) That must be subdued. A door has been opened wide for the effectual spread of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-20.htm" title="So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.">Acts 19:20</a>). Of that the Apostle must avail himself. Therefore he will remain where he is until Pentecost. Duty to be done, and danger to be faced in the doing of it, were to such a man as St. Paul sufficient indications as to where he ought to be found.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</span> It is possible that this intention was frustrated by the riot stirred up by the silversmiths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-41</a>). But, in any case, he stayed at Ephesus <span class="accented">nearly</span> as long as he intended, for the riot only occurred when he was already preparing to leave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21, 22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The good examples of other Christians and churches should rouse us. It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.</body></html>
