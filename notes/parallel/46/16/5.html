The Apostle does not here refer to where he is at the moment of writing, but to his intention regarding his journey. He had intended to go first to Corinth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;">2Corinthians 1:15-16</a>), but he has altered that plan, and says that his intention now is to pass through Macedonia first, and then visit Corinth. Then he says, "For I <span class= "ital">do</span> pass through Macedonia." To this intention the Apostle adheres. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I shall pass through</span> <span class="cmt_word">Macedonia;</span> rather, <span class="accented">when 1 have passed through Macedonia. <span class="cmt_word"></span>For I do pass through Macedonia</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for 1 mean to pass through Macedonia.</span> We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-15.htm">2 Corinthians 1:15, 16</a>, that it had been St. Paul's intention to sail from Ephesus to Corinth, thence, after a brief stay, to proceed to Macedonia, and on his return to come again for a longer stay at Corinth on his way to Judaea. He had in an Epistle, now lost (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>), announced to them this intention, he changed his plan because, in the present disgraceful state of disorganization into which the Church had fallen, he felt that he could not visit them without being compelled to exercise a severity which, he hoped, might be obviated by writing to them and delaying his intended visit. Nothing but his usual delicacy and desire to spare them prevented him from stating all this more fully (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>). Mistaking the kindness of his purpose, the Corinthians accused him of levity. He defends himself from this charge in the Second Epistle, and he carried out the plan which he here announces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The good examples of other Christians and churches should rouse us. It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.</body></html>
