The Church adopted it; and when thus interchanged between those whose bond of friendship was not earthly, but spiritual, it was designated "the holy kiss." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-16.htm" title="Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.">Romans 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm" title="Greet all the brothers with an holy kiss.">1Thessalonians 5:26</a>.) The practice was given up in the Latin Church in the thirteenth century, but is still used in the Greek Church on certain great occasions, such as Easter Day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the brethren.</span> The Ephesian Church in general. <span class="cmt_word">With an holy kiss.</span> The kiss of peace is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-14.htm">1 Peter 5:14</a>. It was a sign of the reconciliation of all dissensions. But the abuse of the practice and the hideous heathen calumnies which it helped to perpetuate, led to its abolition. In the Roman Church a shadow of it still remains in the custom of the congregation kissing the <span class="accented">pax</span> after the priest has kissed it. The custom still continues in the <span class="accented">Christos voscress</span> of Easter Day in the Greek Church, when - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">" See! the bearded faces kiss each other:<br />Every Russian Christian loves his brother.<br />Serf or noble, each today may claim<br />Friendly kiss in that all friendly Name."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:19-24 Christianity by no means destroys civility. Religion should promote a courteous and obliging temper towards all. Those give a false idea of religion, and reproach it, who would take encouragement from it to be sour and morose. And Christian salutations are not mere empty compliments; but are real expressions of good-will to others, and commend them to the Divine grace and blessing. Every Christian family should be as a Christian church. Wherever two or three are gathered together in the name of Christ, and he is among them, there is a church. Here is a solemn warning. Many who have Christ's name much in their mouths, have no true love to him in their hearts. None love him in truth, who do not love his laws, and keep his commandments. Many are Christians in name, who do not love Christ Jesus the Lord in sincerity. Such are separated from the people of God, and the favour of God. Those who love not the Lord Jesus Christ, must perish without remedy. Let us not rest in any religious profession where there is not the love of Christ, earnest desires for his salvation, gratitude for his mercies, and obedience to his commandments. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ has in it all that is good, for time and for eternity. To wish that our friends may have this grace with them, is wishing them the utmost good. And this we should wish all our friends and brethren in Christ. We can wish them nothing greater, and we should wish them nothing less. True Christianity makes us wish those whom we love, the blessings of both worlds; this is meant in wishing the grace of Christ to be with them. The apostle had dealt plainly with the Corinthians, and told them of their faults with just severity; but he parts in love, and with a solemn profession of his love to them for Christ's sake. May our love be with all who are in Christ Jesus. Let us try whether all things appear worthless to us, when compared with Christ and his righteousness. Do we allow ourselves in any known sin, or in the neglect of any known duty? By such inquiries, faithfully made, we may judge of the state of our souls.</body></html>
