Those who have built well shall have their reward in their work having survived the trial of the fire; those who have built otherwise shall lose everything--their work, which should have remained as their reward, will perish in the fire--and they themselves will be as men who only make good their escape by rushing through a conflagration, leaving all that was theirs to be destroyed. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm" title="For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.">Mark 9:49</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man's work shall abide.</span> St. Paul is speaking primarily of teachers, though, of course, his words apply by analogy to all believers. <span class="cmt_word">He shall receive a reward</span>. One of the teacher's rewards will be his converts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>), who will be "his joy and crown of glorying" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>); another will be "a crown of glory that fadeth not away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>); yet another will be fresh opportunities for higher labour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-23.htm">Matthew 25:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:10-15 The apostle was a wise master-builder; but the grace of God made him such. Spiritual pride is abominable; it is using the greatest favours of God, to feed our own vanity, and make idols of ourselves. But let every man take heed; there may be bad building on a good foundation. Nothing must be laid upon it, but what the foundation will bear, and what is of a piece with it. Let us not dare to join a merely human or a carnal life with a Divine faith, the corruption of sin with the profession of Christianity. Christ is a firm, abiding, and immovable Rock of ages, every way able to bear all the weight that God himself or the sinner can lay upon him; neither is there salvation in any other. Leave out the doctrine of his atonement, and there is no foundation for our hopes. But of those who rest on this foundation, there are two sorts. Some hold nothing but the truth as it is in Jesus, and preach nothing else. Others build on the good foundation what will not abide the test, when the day of trail comes. We may be mistaken in ourselves and others; but there is a day coming that will show our actions in the true light, without covering or disguise. Those who spread true and pure religion in all its branches, and whose work will abide in the great day, shall receive a reward. And how great! how much exceeding their deserts! There are others, whose corrupt opinions and doctrines, or vain inventions and usages in the worship of God, shall be made known, disowned, and rejected, in that day. This is plainly meant of a figurative fire, not of a real one; for what real fire can consume religious rites or doctrines? And it is to try every man's works, those of Paul and Apollos, as well as others. Let us consider the tendency of our undertakings, compare them with God's word, and judge ourselves, that we be not judged of the Lord.</body></html>
