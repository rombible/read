(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-3.htm" title="For I say, through the grace given to me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.">Romans 12:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Wise</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> skilful or judicious.<p><span class= "bld">Another buildeth thereon.</span>--The sequence of the work here is the same as in the planting and watering of the previous illustration. The use of the indefinite word "another" avoids what might be considered the invidiously frequent repetition of the name of Apollos, and also indicates that there were others also who came after Paul, as is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1Corinthians 4:15</a>. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm" title="Yes, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation:">Romans 15:20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But let every man take heed how he</span> buildeth thereupon.--Better, <span class= "ital">But let each one see in what manner he buildeth thereon.</span> The argument in this and the following verse is that there can be only one foundation in the spiritual building--namely, the personal Jesus Christ. That foundation the Apostle has laid. None can alter it or add to it as a foundation; but there may be an immense variety in the materials with which those who come after the laying of the foundation may build up the superstructure. Therefore their own work and "how" they build (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> with what materials), and not the one foundation once for all and unalterably laid, should be the subject of their thought and care.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to the grace of God which is given unto me;</span> rather, <span class="accented">which was given.</span> Here, again, we have St. Paul's <span class="accented">baptismal aorist</span> - his habit of regarding his whole spiritual life as potentially summed up in the one crisis of conversion and baptism. This phrase is a favourite one with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a wise master builder.</span> "Wise" only in the sense of subordinating every pretence of human wisdom to the will of God; and here the adjective only applies to the wisdom required by a builder. In other words, "wise" is here equivalent to "skilful." Since Paul had received the grace of God for this very purpose, he was made "wise" by the knowledge of Christ (for the metaphor of building, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The foundation</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">foundation.</span> Though in truth there is but one foundation, as he proceeds to say, St. Paul always refused to build on the foundation laid by another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Another</span>. Perhaps the special allusion is to Apollos. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:10-15 The apostle was a wise master-builder; but the grace of God made him such. Spiritual pride is abominable; it is using the greatest favours of God, to feed our own vanity, and make idols of ourselves. But let every man take heed; there may be bad building on a good foundation. Nothing must be laid upon it, but what the foundation will bear, and what is of a piece with it. Let us not dare to join a merely human or a carnal life with a Divine faith, the corruption of sin with the profession of Christianity. Christ is a firm, abiding, and immovable Rock of ages, every way able to bear all the weight that God himself or the sinner can lay upon him; neither is there salvation in any other. Leave out the doctrine of his atonement, and there is no foundation for our hopes. But of those who rest on this foundation, there are two sorts. Some hold nothing but the truth as it is in Jesus, and preach nothing else. Others build on the good foundation what will not abide the test, when the day of trail comes. We may be mistaken in ourselves and others; but there is a day coming that will show our actions in the true light, without covering or disguise. Those who spread true and pure religion in all its branches, and whose work will abide in the great day, shall receive a reward. And how great! how much exceeding their deserts! There are others, whose corrupt opinions and doctrines, or vain inventions and usages in the worship of God, shall be made known, disowned, and rejected, in that day. This is plainly meant of a figurative fire, not of a real one; for what real fire can consume religious rites or doctrines? And it is to try every man's works, those of Paul and Apollos, as well as others. Let us consider the tendency of our undertakings, compare them with God's word, and judge ourselves, that we be not judged of the Lord.</body></html>
