Christ is God's as being Mediator (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-28.htm" title="You have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.">John 14:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>.) There was no danger, in that early age of the Church, of these words being misunderstood (as some have endeavoured to misunderstand them since) as in the least implying a want of absolute identity between the Son, in regard of His Divine Nature, and the Father.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And ye are Christ's</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>). Christians possess because they are possessed by Christ (Meyer). Christ is our Master, and God our Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-10.htm">Matthew 23:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Christ is God's;</span> because "Christ is equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, but inferior to the Father as touching his manhood." Hence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a> he says, "The head of Christ is God;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>, we read of Christ resigning his mediatorial kingdom, that God may be all in all. Perhaps St. Paul implies the thought that Christ belongs, not to a party, but to God, the Father of us all. But the ultimate climax from Christ to God is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:18-23 To have a high opinion of our own wisdom, is but to flatter ourselves; and self-flattery is the next step to self-deceit. The wisdom that wordly men esteem, is foolishness with God. How justly does he despise, and how easily can he baffle and confound it! The thoughts of the wisest men in the world, have vanity, weakness, and folly in them. All this should teach us to be humble, and make us willing to be taught of God, so as not to be led away, by pretences to human wisdom and skill, from the simple truths revealed by Christ. Mankind are very apt to oppose the design of the mercies of God. Observe the spiritual riches of a true believer; All are yours, even ministers and ordinances. Nay, the world itself is yours. Saints have as much of it as Infinite Wisdom sees fit for them, and they have it with the Divine blessing. Life is yours, that you may have a season and opportunity to prepare for the life of heaven; and death is yours, that you may go to the possession of it. It is the kind messenger to take you from sin and sorrow, and to guide you to your Father's house. Things present are yours, for your support on the road; things to come are yours, to delight you for ever at your journey's end. If we belong to Christ, and are true to him, all good belongs to us, and is sure to us. Believers are the subjects of his kingdom. He is Lord over us, we must own his dominion, and cheerfully submit to his command. God in Christ, reconciling a sinful world to himself, and pouring the riches of his grace on a reconciled world, is the sum and substance of the gospel.</body></html>
