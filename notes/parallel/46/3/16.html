Out of this Epistle it only occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That ye are the temple of God.</span> "Ye," both collectively (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>) and individually; "God's shrine;" not built for men's glory. The word "temple" in the Old Testament always means the material temple; in the Gospels our Lord "spake of the temple of his body;" in the rest of the New Testament the body of every baptized Christian is the temple of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-16.htm">1 Corinthians 6:16</a>), because "God dwelleth in him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>).

Such teaching tended to corrupt, to pollute, and destroy the building, which should be kept pure and holy for God. Those who spread loose principles, which render the church of God unholy, bring destruction upon themselves. Christ by his Spirit dwells in all true believers. Christians are holy by profession, and should be pure and clean, both in heart and conversation. He is deceived who deems himself the temple of the Holy Ghost, yet is unconcerned about personal holiness, or the peace and purity of the church.</body></html>
