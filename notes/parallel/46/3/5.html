He asserts that all alike--both those who teach the simpler truths, and those who build up upon that primary knowledge--are only instruments in God's hand; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10-15</a> (replying to those who sneered at and despised his simple teaching as compared to the higher instruction of Apollos) he points out that though all are only instruments used by God, yet that if there be any difference of honour or utility in the various kinds of work for which God so uses His ministers, the greater work is the planting the seed, or the laying the foundation. There can be only one foundation--it is alike necessary and unvarying--many others may build upon it, with varied material and with different results.<p><span class= "bld">Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">What then is Apollos? what is Paul?</span> and to these abrupt and startling questions the answer is, "Merely those whom Christ used, according as He gave to each his own peculiar powers as the means of your conversion."

It is therefore absurd that you should exalt them into heads of parties.

We should not put ministers into the place of God. He that planteth and he that watereth are one, employed by one Master, trusted with the same revelation, busied in one work, and engaged in one design. They have their different gifts from one and the same Spirit, for the very same purposes; and should carry on the same design heartily. Those who work hardest shall fare best. Those who are most faithful shall have the greatest reward. They work together with God, in promoting the purposes of his glory, and the salvation of precious souls; and He who knows their work, will take care they do not labour in vain. They are employed in his husbandry and building; and He will carefully look over them.</body></html>
