Let party-spirit cease. Do not degrade yourselves by calling yourselves after the names of any man, for everything is yours--then teachers only exist for you. The enthusiasm of the Apostle, as he speaks of the privileges of Christians, leads him on beyond the bare assertion necessary to the logical conclusion of the argument, and enlarging the idea he dwells, in a few brief and impressive utterances, on the limitless possessions--in life and in death, in the present life and that which is future--which belong to those who are united with Christ. But they must remember that all this is theirs because they "are Christ's." They are possessors because possessed by Him. "His <span class= "ital">service</span> is their perfect <span class= "ital">freedom</span>" as the Collect in the English Prayer Book puts it, or, more strikingly, as it occurs in the Latin version, "Whom to serve, is to reign."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span>. St. Paul, with this word, concludes the argument of warning of the previous section, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-7.htm">1 Corinthians 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; 8:38; 11:33; 14:39; 15:58 (Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">All things are yours.</span> It is always a tendency of Christians to underrate the grandeur of their privileges by exaggerating their supposed monopoly of <span class="accented">some</span> of them, while <span class="accented">many</span> equally rich advantages are at their disposal. Instead of becoming partisans of special teachers, and champions of separate doctrines, they might enjoy all that was good in the doctrine of all teachers, whether they were prophets, or pastors, or evangelists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11, 12</a>). The true God gives us <span class="accented">all things</span> richly to enjoy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:18-23 To have a high opinion of our own wisdom, is but to flatter ourselves; and self-flattery is the next step to self-deceit. The wisdom that wordly men esteem, is foolishness with God. How justly does he despise, and how easily can he baffle and confound it! The thoughts of the wisest men in the world, have vanity, weakness, and folly in them. All this should teach us to be humble, and make us willing to be taught of God, so as not to be led away, by pretences to human wisdom and skill, from the simple truths revealed by Christ. Mankind are very apt to oppose the design of the mercies of God. Observe the spiritual riches of a true believer; All are yours, even ministers and ordinances. Nay, the world itself is yours. Saints have as much of it as Infinite Wisdom sees fit for them, and they have it with the Divine blessing. Life is yours, that you may have a season and opportunity to prepare for the life of heaven; and death is yours, that you may go to the possession of it. It is the kind messenger to take you from sin and sorrow, and to guide you to your Father's house. Things present are yours, for your support on the road; things to come are yours, to delight you for ever at your journey's end. If we belong to Christ, and are true to him, all good belongs to us, and is sure to us. Believers are the subjects of his kingdom. He is Lord over us, we must own his dominion, and cheerfully submit to his command. God in Christ, reconciling a sinful world to himself, and pouring the riches of his grace on a reconciled world, is the sum and substance of the gospel.</body></html>
