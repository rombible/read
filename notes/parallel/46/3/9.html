"<span class= "ital">We</span> are GOD'S fellow-labourers; <span class= "ital">you</span> are GOD'S field--GOD'S house." The image is thus suddenly altered from agriculture to architecture, as the latter can be more amplified, and will better illustrate the great variety of work of which the Apostle proceeds subsequently to speak. This sudden change of metaphor is a characteristic of St. Paul's style; a similar instance is to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)">2Corinthians 10:4-8</a>, where the illustration given from architecture is used instead of the military metaphor which is employed in the earlier verses of that passage. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-7.htm" title="Who goes a warfare any time at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof? or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?">1Corinthians 9:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-6.htm" title=" As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:">Colossians 2:6-7</a>, where there is the introduction of three distinct images in rapid succession in so many sentences. It has been suggested that possibly the use of the word "field," in the Greek "Georgion," was the cause of the Christian name "George" becoming so popular in the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God's fellow workers.</span> Throughout the Bible we are taught that God requires the work of man, and that he will not help those who will do nothing for themselves or for him.

The word" husbandry" may also mean vineyard, and the metaphor is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm">Romans 11:16-24</a>.

They have their different gifts from one and the same Spirit, for the very same purposes; and should carry on the same design heartily. Those who work hardest shall fare best. Those who are most faithful shall have the greatest reward. They work together with God, in promoting the purposes of his glory, and the salvation of precious souls; and He who knows their work, will take care they do not labour in vain. They are employed in his husbandry and building; and He will carefully look over them.</body></html>
