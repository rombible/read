As God commanded the punishment of death to be inflicted on whoever defiled the actual Temple (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm" title="And they shall be on Aaron, and on his sons, when they come in to the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever to him and his seed after him.">Exodus 28:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.">Leviticus 16:2</a>), because it was holy unto the Lord, and His presence dwelt there; so they, having the same Spirit in them, were a temple also holy unto the Lord, and God would not leave him unpunished who destroyed or marred this spiritual temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man defile the temple of God.</span> The verb is the same as in the next clause, and should be rendered, <span class="accented">If any man destroy the temple of God</span>; but the word is perhaps too strong, and the word "mar" or "injure" might better convey the meaning (Olshausen). The two verbs are brought into vivid juxtaposition in the original: "God shall ruin the ruiner of his temple." St. Paul was, perhaps, thinking of the penalty of death attached to any one who desecrated the temple of Jerusalem. Inscriptions on the <span class="accented">chel</span>, or "middle wall of partition," threatened death to any Gentile who set foot within the sacred enclosure." <span class="cmt_word">Which temple ye are;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the which are ye</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ye are holy. St. Paul is here referring to the Church of Corinth, and to the false teachers who desecrated it by bringing in "factions of destruction" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). Ideally the Church was glorious, "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16,17 From other parts of the epistle, it appears that the false teachers among the Corinthians taught unholy doctrines. Such teaching tended to corrupt, to pollute, and destroy the building, which should be kept pure and holy for God. Those who spread loose principles, which render the church of God unholy, bring destruction upon themselves. Christ by his Spirit dwells in all true believers. Christians are holy by profession, and should be pure and clean, both in heart and conversation. He is deceived who deems himself the temple of the Holy Ghost, yet is unconcerned about personal holiness, or the peace and purity of the church.</body></html>
