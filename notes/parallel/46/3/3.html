Partisanship and discord, the sins of the Corinthians - sins which have disgraced so many ages of Church history - are works of the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>), and involve many other sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>), and are therefore sure proofs of the carnal mind, though they are usually accompanied by a boast of superior spiritual enlightenment.

Men may have much doctrinal knowledge, yet be mere beginners in the life of faith and experience. Contentions and quarrels about religion are sad evidences of carnality. True religion makes men peaceable, not contentious. But it is to be lamented, that many who should walk as Christians, live and act too much like other men. Many professors, and preachers also, show themselves to be yet carnal, by vain-glorious strife, eagerness for dispute, and readiness to despise and speak evil of others.</body></html>
