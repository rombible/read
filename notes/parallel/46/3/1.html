In the closing verses of 1 Corinthians 2 St. Paul has enunciated the general method of teaching spiritual truth as being dependent upon the receptive powers of those who are being taught. He now proceeds to point out to them that their own character, as being wanting in spirituality, was the real hindrance to his teaching them the higher spiritual truth which may be called "the wisdom" of the gospel.<p><span class= "bld">As unto carnal.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as being carnal.</span> Our version may seem to imply that the Apostle spoke to them <span class= "ital">as if</span> they were carnal, though they really were not so; but the force of the passage is that they were indeed carnal, and that the Apostle taught them not as if they were such, but as being such. "Carnal" is here the opposite of "spiritual," and does not involve any reference to what we would commonly speak of as carnal sin.<p><span class= "bld">Babes in Christ.</span>--This is the opposite of the "full grown" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6</a>, to whom the "wisdom" could be taught.

It may be an interesting indication of the "manliness" of St. Paul's character and his high estimate of it in others, that he constantly uses the words "babe" and "childhood" in a depreciatory sense. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-20.htm" title="An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.">Romans 2:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - <span class="accented">The carnal conceit of the spiritually immature.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I... could not speak unto you as unto spiritual.</span> Though softened by the word brethren, there was a crushing irony of reproof in these words: "You thought yourselves quite above the need of my simple teaching. You were looking down on me from the whole height of your inferiority. The elementary character of my doctrine was after all the necessary consequence of your own incapacity for anything more profound." <span class="cmt_word">As unto carnal.</span> The true reading here is <span class="accented">sarkinois</span>, fleshen, not <span class="accented">sarkikois</span>, fleshly, or carnal; the later and severer word is perhaps first used in ver. 3. The word <span class="accented">sarkinos</span> (<span class="accented">earneus</span>), fleshen, implies earthliness and weakness and the absence of spirituality; but <span class="accented">sarki-kos</span> (<span class="accented">carnalis</span>) involves the dominance of the lower nature and antagonism to the spiritual. <span class="cmt_word">As mite babes in Christ.</span> The word "babes" has a good and a bad sense. In its good sense it implies humility and teachableness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>, "In malice be ye babes;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>, "As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>. Here it is used in its bad sense of spiritual childishness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 The most simple truths of the gospel, as to man's sinfulness and God's mercy, repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, stated in the plainest language, suit the people better than deeper mysteries. Men may have much doctrinal knowledge, yet be mere beginners in the life of faith and experience. Contentions and quarrels about religion are sad evidences of carnality. True religion makes men peaceable, not contentious. But it is to be lamented, that many who should walk as Christians, live and act too much like other men. Many professors, and preachers also, show themselves to be yet carnal, by vain-glorious strife, eagerness for dispute, and readiness to despise and speak evil of others.</body></html>
