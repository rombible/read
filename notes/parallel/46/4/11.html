Such insults, together with scourgings, fell to the lot of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a>, etc.) and the other apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-20.htm">1 Peter 2:20</a>), as well as to that of their Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57</a>, etc.). It showed the utter contempt with which they were treated; for though St. Paul ought to have been exempt from such violence, both as a freeman and a Roman citizen, he was treated as vilely as if he had been a mere foreign slave. <span class="cmt_word">Have no certain dwelling place.</span> This homelessness was among the severest of all trials (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-13 We have no reason to be proud; all we have, or are, or do, that is good, is owing to the free and rich grace of God. A sinner snatched from destruction by sovereign grace alone, must be very absurd and inconsistent, if proud of the free gifts of God. St. Paul sets forth his own circumstances, ver. 9. Allusion is made to the cruel spectacles in the Roman games; where men were forced to cut one another to pieces, to divert the people; and where the victor did not escape with his life, though he should destroy his adversary, but was only kept for another combat, and must be killed at last. The thought that many eyes are upon believers, when struggling with difficulties or temptations, should encourage constancy and patience. We are weak, but ye are strong. All Christians are not alike exposed. Some suffer greater hardships than others. The apostle enters into particulars of their sufferings. And how glorious the charity and devotion that carried them through all these hardships! They suffered in their persons and characters as the worst and vilest of men; as the very dirt of the world, that was to be swept away: nay, as the offscouring of all things, the dross of all things. And every one who would be faithful in Christ Jesus, must be prepared for poverty and contempt. Whatever the disciples of Christ suffer from men, they must follow the example, and fulfil the will and precepts of their Lord. They must be content, with him and for him, to be despised and abused. It is much better to be rejected, despised, and ill used, as St. Paul was, than to have the good opinion and favour of the world. Though cast off by the world as vile, yet we may be precious to God, gathered up with his own hand, and placed upon his throne.</body></html>
