He does not even judge himself as worthy and faithful because he is not conscious of any unfaithfulness; yet that is no justification to him--his only judge is the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">Man's judgment.</span>--The literal translation is <span class= "ital">man's day.</span> Some have thought they saw in it a provincialism or a Hebraism. Probably, however, the explanation is that St. Paul lived with the idea of the day of the Lord as the judgment day so constantly before him, that he uses the words as synonymous. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1Corinthians 3:13</a>, "the day shall declare it.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. The Corinthians might have expected that the conclusion of St. Paul's remarks would be a recognition of their right to sit in judgment on his faithfulness; but it is, on the contrary, an expression of his complete indifference to their shallow and unfair estimate, and an appeal to the approval of his own conscience and to the judgment of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">It is a very small thing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it is for the least. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That I should be judged of you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that I should be examined by you</span> (<span class="accented">anakritho</span>). Technically the word <span class="accented">anakrisis</span> means "an examination preliminary to trial." <span class="cmt_word">Or of man's judgment</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of man's day.</span> The brief day of human life is bounded by too narrow an horizon for accurate judgments. Many of the greatest and best men have felt, like Lord Bacon, that they must leave to other generations the right estimate of their characters, views, and actions. St. Jerome reckons the expression "day" for "judgment" among the "Cilicisms" of St. Paul (Jeremiah, 'Ad Algas.,' 10), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the expressions due to his early training in Cilicia. More probably (as Grotius thinks) there is a reference to the "day" fixed for earthly trials (<span class="accented">diem dicere</span>, equivalent to "to impeach"), and to the phrase "the day of judgment" - "the woeful day" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-16.htm">Jeremiah 17:16</a>. The word "day" in all languages and idioms signifies "judgment" (Hammond). From <span class="accented">dies</span>, a day, comes the phrase "a diet." A "daysman" means an arbitrator. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, I judge not mine own self.</span> Here, as in the previous clause and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>, the verb is not <span class="accented">krino</span>, I judge, but <span class="accented">anakrino</span>, I examine. Thus the verse discourages all morbid self introspection. It also shows that St. Paul is not arrogantly proclaiming himself superior to the opinion of the Corinthians, but is pointing out the necessary inadequacy of all human judgments. The heart is too liable to self deceit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9, 10</a>) to enable it to pronounce a judgment with unerring accuracy. Hence neither a man's contemporaries nor the man himself can form any final estimate of him or of his fitting position, because their knowledge is too imperfect. History often reverses the decision of contemporaries. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Apostles were no more than servants of Christ, but they were not to be undervalued. They had a great trust, and for that reason, had an honourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, but he knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not prove himself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for one against another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed by God, and endowed by him with various talents.</body></html>
