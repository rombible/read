It is to this fact allusion is here made--from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>, we see that the Apostle did not calculate on Timothy's arrival in Corinth until after this letter had reached them. The rumours of the existence of factions in Corinth had reached St. Paul before Timothy had departed, and were the cause of his desire that before himself visiting Corinth Timothy should do so, and bring the Corinthians to a better frame of mind before the Apostle's arrival. After Timothy's departure from Ephesus the Apostle heard from the household of Chloe how very much worse than he had imagined from the previous rumours was the state of affairs at Corinth. It would not do to let such a condition of things continue to grow and intensify until Timothy should arrive there, delayed as he would be in visiting other places in Macedonia and Achaia <span class= "ital">en route.</span> Nor, indeed, would it be safe to leave one of Timothy's nervous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>) and gentle temperament (perhaps the result of his having been brought up and educated entirely by women, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-5.htm" title="When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.">2Timothy 1:5</a>) to deal with such a state of anarchy as the Apostle now knew to exist in Corinth. Further, the letter from Corinth had arrived since Timothy had left, and it required an immediate answer. Such reason, doubtless, influenced St. Paul in sending this letter to Corinth at once so as to anticipate the arrival of Timothy there. That you might return to the dutiful position of sons, I sent you one who is a son--a beloved and a faithful spiritual child--who will not be an addition to the too numerous instructors already at Corinth, but will, by what he says, and by his own example, remind you of my teaching (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2Timothy 3:10</a>), which he fully understands, and which never varies, being the same to every church. The emphatic use of the word "my son" here in reference to Timothy, taken in connection with the clear expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1Corinthians 4:15</a> of what was involved in that spiritual relationship, shows that St. Paul had converted Timothy to the faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>). In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians St. Paul speaks of Timothy as his "brother" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause.</span> Because, as your spiritual father, I naturally take the deepest interest in your well being. Have I sent; rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">sent.</span> Timothy had started before this letter was despatched (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>), but he did not reach Corinth till after its arrival, because he had been unable to go by sea, and had to travel round by Macedonia. St. Paul, on hearing the grave news from Corinth, seems to have countermanded him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>, "<span class="accented">If</span> Timotheus come"), but was uncertain whether the messenger would reach him in time. The necessity for despatching <span class="accented">Titus</span> had been more immediate. <span class="cmt_word">My beloved son, and faithful in the Lord;</span> rather, <span class="accented">who is my beloved and faithful child</span> (<span class="accented">teknon</span>) <span class="accented">in the Lord.</span> St. Paul had converted him, and felt towards him all the love of a father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ.</span> The expression shows all St. Paul's delicacy. He is not sending the youthful Timothy as an authoritative teacher, since the Corinthians, fond of high pretension and soaring oratory, might scorn to show any submission to a shy and shrinking youth; but he is only sending him because, as his closest companion, Timothy would be best able to explain to them his plans and wishes in the organization of Churches. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-21 In reproving for sin, we should distinguish between sinners and their sins. Reproofs that kindly and affectionately warn, are likely to reform. Though the apostle spoke with authority as a parent, he would rather beseech them in love. And as ministers are to set an example, others must follow them, as far as they follow Christ in faith and practice. Christians may mistake and differ in their views, but Christ and Christian truth are the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Whenever the gospel is effectual, it comes not in word only, but also in power, by the Holy Spirit, quickening dead sinners, delivering persons from the slavery of sin and Satan, renewing them both inwardly and outwardly, and comforting, strengthening, and establishing the saints, which cannot be done by the persuasive language of men, but by the power of God. And it is a happy temper, to have the spirit of love and meekness bear the rule, yet to maintain just authority.</body></html>
