The moment they heard the announcement that he was sending Timothy, they would naturally say, That is a proof of the truth of our assertion. He is afraid to come himself, so he sends Timothy in his stead. "But," says St. Paul, "I will come to you shortly, God willing"--his intention was to remain at Ephesus until after Pentecost (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm" title="But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.">1Corinthians 16:8</a>)--"and then I shall take cognisance of spiritual power, and not of empty and boastful words; for that kingdom which Christ founded, and which we, his ambassadors, are establishing, does not consist in mere words, but in spiritual might."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are puffed up;</span> rather, <span class="accented">were puffed up</span>; at the time that they made these disparaging comparisons of me with others. <span class="cmt_word">As though I would not come to you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as though I were not coming to you.</span> St. Paul was on the eve of starting for Macedonia on his way to visit them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>), but, owing to the grievous state of the Church, he subsequently changed his purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-15.htm">2 Corinthians 1:15, 23</a>). When he left them he had promised to return, "if God wilt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-21.htm">Acts 18:21</a>). His many enemies and critics were likely to say, "He is afraid to come himself, and so he sends Timothy." They flattered themselves that he was alarmed by their culture and intellectualism. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-21 In reproving for sin, we should distinguish between sinners and their sins. Reproofs that kindly and affectionately warn, are likely to reform. Though the apostle spoke with authority as a parent, he would rather beseech them in love. And as ministers are to set an example, others must follow them, as far as they follow Christ in faith and practice. Christians may mistake and differ in their views, but Christ and Christian truth are the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Whenever the gospel is effectual, it comes not in word only, but also in power, by the Holy Spirit, quickening dead sinners, delivering persons from the slavery of sin and Satan, renewing them both inwardly and outwardly, and comforting, strengthening, and establishing the saints, which cannot be done by the persuasive language of men, but by the power of God. And it is a happy temper, to have the spirit of love and meekness bear the rule, yet to maintain just authority.</body></html>
