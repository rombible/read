This labour was no recreation or pastime with St. Paul, it was hard and earnest work. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.">1Thessalonians 2:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2Thessalonians 3:8</a>.) That this labour was rendered more excessive from the Apostle's characteristic generosity to others, we may conclude from the expression used in his farewell to the Ephesian elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-17.htm" title="And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.">Acts 20:17-38</a>), "Ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me."<p><span class= "bld">Being reviled, we bless.</span>--A striking contrast to the way in which the Corinthians would act under similar circumstances, and yet a literal obedience to the teaching of the Master (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm" title="But I say to you, That you resist not evil: but whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.">Matthew 5:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a>). Thus the Apostle became in the eyes of the world, "a fool" for Christ's sake.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Labour, working with our own hands.</span> St. Paul supported himself by the dreary toil and scant earnings of a tent maker, in the express determination to be no burden upon his converts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7</a>, etc.). Such conduct was the more noble because all mechanical trades were looked down upon by the Greeks as a sort of <span class="accented">banausia.</span> And though it was repellent and mechanical work to be handling the strong scented black goats' hair all day, yet by this labour he maintained not only himself but also his brother missionaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Being reviled.</span> The early Christians were falsely accused of the most execrable crimes, so that the very name "Christian" was regarded as equivalent to "malefactor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We bless.</span> Herein they obeyed the direct precept of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>), as well as his example (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-13 We have no reason to be proud; all we have, or are, or do, that is good, is owing to the free and rich grace of God. A sinner snatched from destruction by sovereign grace alone, must be very absurd and inconsistent, if proud of the free gifts of God. St. Paul sets forth his own circumstances, ver. 9. Allusion is made to the cruel spectacles in the Roman games; where men were forced to cut one another to pieces, to divert the people; and where the victor did not escape with his life, though he should destroy his adversary, but was only kept for another combat, and must be killed at last. The thought that many eyes are upon believers, when struggling with difficulties or temptations, should encourage constancy and patience. We are weak, but ye are strong. All Christians are not alike exposed. Some suffer greater hardships than others. The apostle enters into particulars of their sufferings. And how glorious the charity and devotion that carried them through all these hardships! They suffered in their persons and characters as the worst and vilest of men; as the very dirt of the world, that was to be swept away: nay, as the offscouring of all things, the dross of all things. And every one who would be faithful in Christ Jesus, must be prepared for poverty and contempt. Whatever the disciples of Christ suffer from men, they must follow the example, and fulfil the will and precepts of their Lord. They must be content, with him and for him, to be despised and abused. It is much better to be rejected, despised, and ill used, as St. Paul was, than to have the good opinion and favour of the world. Though cast off by the world as vile, yet we may be precious to God, gathered up with his own hand, and placed upon his throne.</body></html>
