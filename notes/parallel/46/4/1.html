It implies not only those who are under one superior, but those who are in a still inferior position--the officer who has to obey orders, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm" title="Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.">Matthew 5:25</a>--a "servant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-58.htm" title="But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.">Matthew 26:58</a>). Though servants, their office is one of great trust; they are "stewards" to whom the owner of the house has entrusted the care of those sacred things--"mysteries"--which heretofore have been hidden, but are now made known to them, his faithful subordinates. It is to be remembered that even the steward in a Greek household was generally a slave.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - <span class="accented">Judgments, human and Divine, respecting ministers.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let a man so account of us.</span> Since it is inevitable that Christians should form some estimate of the position of their ministers, he proceeds to tell them what that estimate should be. Ministers are not to be unduly magnified, for their position is subordinate; they are not to be unduly depreciated, for if they are faithful they may appeal from frivolous human prejudices and careless depreciations to that only Judge and Master before whom they stand or fall. <span class="cmt_word">Ministers</span>; here <span class="accented">huperetas</span>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a> <span class="accented">diakonous.</span> They are <span class="accented">huperetai</span> (in its derivation "under rowers") in their relation to Christ; <span class="accented">diakonoi in</span> their relation to men. <span class="cmt_word">Of Christ;</span> and therefore responsible to Him. <span class="cmt_word">Stewards</span>; dispensers, subordinate distributors. These "agents" were higher slaves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-1.htm">Luke 16:1-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the mysteries of God</span>. The word "mysteries" means truths once hidden but now revealed; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>, "Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God." In later patristic usage the word means "sacraments;" but St. Paul has expressly said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>) that his mission was to preach the gospel, not primarily to administer the sacraments. (For descriptions of the work of a minister according to St. Paul's lofty ideal, see the pastoral Epistles, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18-21, 24-28</a>. St. Peter's is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-4</a>.) A minister is not to be estimated as a supernatural teacher, or a civil autocrat, or an infallible critic, but as an ambassador from Christ, who reveals to the "initiated" that which they could not otherwise know. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Apostles were no more than servants of Christ, but they were not to be undervalued. They had a great trust, and for that reason, had an honourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, but he knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not prove himself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for one against another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed by God, and endowed by him with various talents.</body></html>
