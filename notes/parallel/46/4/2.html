The argument here is that, as in the case of an earthly steward, inquiry is made into his character as to whether he be trustworthy--so it will be with them who are stewards of the mysteries of God. That inquiry is, of course, made in regard to an earthly steward by his master in whose service he is; and so the Lord alone, whose stewards the Apostles were, shall be the inquirer into <span class= "ital">their</span> faithfulness. If we take <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.">1Corinthians 4:2</a> as it is in our English version, it would seem to imply that on this point of faithfulness the Church might prefer one steward to another. This would be to suggest that to some extent, therefore, party-spirit might exist, which would be contrary to the whole argument from the commencement of the Epistle, and strikingly at variance with the remarks which immediately follow in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1Corinthians 4:5</a>. The rendering adopted above is a more literal translation of the best Greek texts, and also perfectly in harmony with the general sense of the passage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span>.

It may be required of him as a minister that he should be faithful, but if, being faithful, he is misjudged and depreciated, his appeal lies to a truer and loftier tribunal. <span class="cmt_word">It is required.</span> This is the reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, C, D. Other manuscripts have "ye require;" but the sound of the two words in Hellenistic Greek would have been almost indistinguishable. <span class="cmt_word">That a man be found faithful.</span> We have a right to demand that on trial he be proved to be honest and diligent. So our Lord has described the "faithful and wise steward" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42, 43</a>. What is required of ministers is neither brilliancy, nor eloquence, nor profound knowledge, nor success, but only - fidelity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Apostles were no more than servants of Christ, but they were not to be undervalued. They had a great trust, and for that reason, had an honourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, but he knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not prove himself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for one against another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed by God, and endowed by him with various talents.</body></html>
