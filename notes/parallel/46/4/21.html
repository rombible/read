I am coming to you as a father in any case. But shall I come as a father comes with a rod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>), and going to inflict punishment with it (such is the force of the Greek, "<span class= "ital">in</span> a rod"); or as a father would come when no faults on the child's part need interfere with the perfect and unrestricted outflowing of his gentleness and love. The pathos of these last few words sufficiently indicate what the Apostle would himself prefer. The choice, however, rested with them. His love would be no love, if without any change on their part, it led him to show no displeasure where correction was for their sake absolutely needed. This is a great and striking example of St. Paul having the "mind of God." He treats the Corinthians as God ever treats His children.<p>This verse at once concludes this first part of the Epistle, in which the party-spirit and the evils resulting from it in Corinth are treated of, and naturally introduces the second topic to be discussed, viz., the case of incest which had occurred, it being one of the things which would compel the Apostle to visit Corinth, not "in love and in the spirit of meekness," but "with a rod."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What will ye?</span> "The whole thing lies with you" (Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">With a rod;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in a rod </span> a not uncommon Greek phrase. The meaning of this expression is best seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-2.htm">2 Corinthians 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>. In love. He would come to them "in love" in any case; but if they now rejected his appeals the love would be compelled to manifest itself in sharpness and stern deeds. <span class="cmt_word">In the spirit of meekness.</span> Meyer here gives to the word "spirit" the sense of "the Holy Spirit," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-13.htm">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>; but the simpler sense of the term is almost certainly the true one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-21 In reproving for sin, we should distinguish between sinners and their sins. Reproofs that kindly and affectionately warn, are likely to reform. Though the apostle spoke with authority as a parent, he would rather beseech them in love. And as ministers are to set an example, others must follow them, as far as they follow Christ in faith and practice. Christians may mistake and differ in their views, but Christ and Christian truth are the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Whenever the gospel is effectual, it comes not in word only, but also in power, by the Holy Spirit, quickening dead sinners, delivering persons from the slavery of sin and Satan, renewing them both inwardly and outwardly, and comforting, strengthening, and establishing the saints, which cannot be done by the persuasive language of men, but by the power of God. And it is a happy temper, to have the spirit of love and meekness bear the rule, yet to maintain just authority.</body></html>
