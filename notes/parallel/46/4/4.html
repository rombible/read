The Greek of the words rendered, "I know nothing of myself," is clearly "I am not conscious in myself" of having been unfaithful; the word being almost invariably used in classical Greek in a bad sense. In the English version the word "by" is used in a sense now nearly obsolete. To an English reader the passage at first sight seems to assert that St. Paul of his own power possessed no knowledge. In old English, however, the word "by" meant (not necessarily the instrument <span class= "ital">by</span> which) frequently "in connection with" or "concerning." In this sense it is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-16.htm" title="Cursed be he that sets light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm" title="In you have they set light by father and mother: in the middle of you have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in you have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.">Ezekiel 22:7</a>. In Foxe's <span class= "ital">Book of Martyrs</span> a woman under examination is accused of having "spoken evil words <span class= "ital">by</span> the queen." It is still common to speak of our place being "by" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in close contiguity to) another, and a <span class= "ital">"bye-</span> lane" is a passage connected with a thoroughfare. The word "by" does not seem to have had necessarily the meaning of "against" which some have attributed to it; the sense of "concerning" would suit all the passages given above better than "against."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know nothing by myself;</span> rather, <span class="accented">nothing against myself.</span> The phrase of the Authorized Version originally meant this, but is now obsolete in this sense. "I am sorry that each fault can be proved by the queen," says Cranmer to Henry VIII. It is like the Latin <span class="accented">Nil conscire sibi.</span> The same phrase occurs in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-6.htm">Job 27:6</a>. St. Paul says, "The verdict of my own conscience acquits me of all intentional unfaithfulness;" but this is insufficient, because God sees with clearer eyes than ours. "Who can understand his errors?" asks the psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>); and the "secret faults" against which he prays are not hidden vices, but sins of which he was himself unconscious. It must be remembered that St. Paul is here only speaking with conscious integrity of his ministerial work. Nothing could have been further from the mind of one who elsewhere calls himself" the chief of sinners" than to claim an absolute immunity from every form of self reproach. They who claim immaculate holiness can as little quote the sanction of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13</a>, etc.) as of any other saint. The confessions of the holiest are ever the most humble. <span class="cmt_word">Yet am I not hereby justified.</span> Because "every way of a man" is apt to be "right in his own eyes," but God pondereth the hearts, and therefore in God's sight "no man living is justified." St. Paul is here using the word in its legal rather than its theological sense. <span class="cmt_word">He that judgeth me is the Lord.</span> This is a reason for serious awe and deep self searching of heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>). Yet also for hope and confidence when a man can, like the modern statesman, "look from the storm without to the sunshine of an approving conscience within." For God, being "greater than our hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>), may count "the long 'yes' of life" against the one "no," or the single faithless minute. Knowing whereof we are made, remembering that we are but dust, he looks on us <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"With larger other eyes than ours,<br />To make allowance for us all."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Apostles were no more than servants of Christ, but they were not to be undervalued. They had a great trust, and for that reason, had an honourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, but he knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not prove himself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for one against another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed by God, and endowed by him with various talents.</body></html>
