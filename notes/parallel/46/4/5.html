When this arrives the truth will be ascertainable, for God will bring into light all the things at present hidden in the darkness, and will show forth the inner motives of each heart.

The word used for "until" (<span class="accented">heos an</span>) points to a time entirely indefinite. <span class="cmt_word">Both</span>; rather, <span class="accented">also</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> among other things. <span class="cmt_word">The hidden things of darkness.</span> "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). God "shall illuminate the crypts of the darkness which naturally fills the self deceiving heart." <span class="cmt_word">The counsels of the hearts.</span> These may bear no scrutiny, even when the actions of the life have been made to look plausible enough. <span class="cmt_word">And then.</span> God only "seeth in secret" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>), and therefore the praise and blame of men may in this life be equally unjust. <span class="cmt_word">Shall every man have praise of God;</span> rather, <span class="accented">each one shall then have his praise</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> such praise as he deserves) <span class="accented">from God.</span> Some of the Greek Fathers (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Theophylact) here make "praise" a "word of intermediate sense," involving either praise or blame. But St. Paul says "praise" for two reasons - partly because he is thinking of faithful teachers like Cephas, Apollos, and himself, who were depreciated by rival factions; and partly because he, like other apostles, shows an invariable tendency to allude to the bright rather than to the dark side of judgment. The "praise from God" - the "Well done, good and faithful servant" - is so infinitely precious that it reduces to insignificance the comparative value of human praise or blame. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Apostles were no more than servants of Christ, but they were not to be undervalued. They had a great trust, and for that reason, had an honourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, but he knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not prove himself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for one against another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed by God, and endowed by him with various talents.</body></html>
