They may have had since their conversion a host of instructors, but they could have only one father who begot them in Jesus Christ. That father was Paul. "I have begotten you." <span class= "ital">I</span>, emphatic as opposed to "many." The word rendered "instructors" originally signified the slave who led the child to school, but subsequently had the larger meaning, which we attach to the word pedagogue. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24-25</a>.) There is a contrast implied between the harsh severity of a pedagogue and the loving tenderness of a father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ten thousand;</span> <span class="accented">never so many.</span> The word in Greek is used indefinitely, but here implies a touch of impatience at the itch of teaching which seems to have prevailed at Corinth.

We have no exact equivalent in English to the <span class="accented">paidagogos</span>, the slave who led boys to school.

In the highest sense we are only begotten by the will of God, by that Word of truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>), to which he alludes in the words "through the gospel." The "second birth" is, however a doctrine more dwelt on by St. John (John 3:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>, etc.) than by St. Paul, who, as Mr. Beet observes, only refers to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:14-21 In reproving for sin, we should distinguish between sinners and their sins. Reproofs that kindly and affectionately warn, are likely to reform. Though the apostle spoke with authority as a parent, he would rather beseech them in love. And as ministers are to set an example, others must follow them, as far as they follow Christ in faith and practice. Christians may mistake and differ in their views, but Christ and Christian truth are the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Whenever the gospel is effectual, it comes not in word only, but also in power, by the Holy Spirit, quickening dead sinners, delivering persons from the slavery of sin and Satan, renewing them both inwardly and outwardly, and comforting, strengthening, and establishing the saints, which cannot be done by the persuasive language of men, but by the power of God. And it is a happy temper, to have the spirit of love and meekness bear the rule, yet to maintain just authority.</body></html>
