Perhaps the word is used here by the Apostle to include that idea in the sufferings, the description of which here reaches a climax. It is not only that we are the filth and off scouring of all men, but we are so for the sake of others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being defamed, we entreat.</span> The expression "we entreat" is very general. It may mean "we entreat men not to speak thus injuriously of us" (Calvin); or "we exhort them to do right." <span class="cmt_word">As the filth of the world</span>. The Greek word <span class="accented">katharmata</span> has a technical sense, in which it means "men devoted to death for purposes of expiation" (<span class="accented">homines piaculares</span>). The word <span class="accented">perikatharnmta</span> has the sense of "sin offerings" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-18.htm">Proverbs 21:18</a>; Tobit 5:18. It is, however, doubtful whether this meaning of the word could have been at all familiar to Greek readers, and it is only in a very general and distantly metaphorical sense that the sufferings of God's saints can be regarded as, in any sense of the word, vicarious. It is better, therefore, here to retain the sense of "refuse" (<span class="accented">purgamenta</span>, things vile and worthless). <span class="cmt_word">The offscouring of all things;</span> perhaps rather, <span class="accented">of</span> <span class="accented">all men.</span> The word <span class="accented">peripsema</span> means "a thing scraped off," and this word also was used in expiatory human sacrifices, where the formula used to victims thus flung into the sea, in times of plague or famine, was, "Become our <span class="accented">peripsema'</span> ('Schol. on Ar.;' Plut., 456). Thus in Tobit (5:18), Anna the wife of Tobias says, "Let the money be used as a <span class="accented">peripsema</span> for the child;" and Ignatius uses the phrase, "I am your <span class="accented">peripsema."</span> From this and the similar phrase in the Letter of Barnabas," I am the <span class="accented">peripsema</span> of your love," it seems to have become a current expression of tenderness among Christians, "I am your <span class="accented">peripsema."</span> But in this case also it may be doubted whether the sacrificial idea was present in the apostle's mind. He is thinking of scenes which he had already faced and would have to face hereafter, when mobs shouted against him that he was "a pestilent fellow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>) and not fit to live (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:7-13 We have no reason to be proud; all we have, or are, or do, that is good, is owing to the free and rich grace of God. A sinner snatched from destruction by sovereign grace alone, must be very absurd and inconsistent, if proud of the free gifts of God. St. Paul sets forth his own circumstances, ver. 9. Allusion is made to the cruel spectacles in the Roman games; where men were forced to cut one another to pieces, to divert the people; and where the victor did not escape with his life, though he should destroy his adversary, but was only kept for another combat, and must be killed at last. The thought that many eyes are upon believers, when struggling with difficulties or temptations, should encourage constancy and patience. We are weak, but ye are strong. All Christians are not alike exposed. Some suffer greater hardships than others. The apostle enters into particulars of their sufferings. And how glorious the charity and devotion that carried them through all these hardships! They suffered in their persons and characters as the worst and vilest of men; as the very dirt of the world, that was to be swept away: nay, as the offscouring of all things, the dross of all things. And every one who would be faithful in Christ Jesus, must be prepared for poverty and contempt. Whatever the disciples of Christ suffer from men, they must follow the example, and fulfil the will and precepts of their Lord. They must be content, with him and for him, to be despised and abused. It is much better to be rejected, despised, and ill used, as St. Paul was, than to have the good opinion and favour of the world. Though cast off by the world as vile, yet we may be precious to God, gathered up with his own hand, and placed upon his throne.</body></html>
