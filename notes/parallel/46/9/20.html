They show in detail both how he became the slave of all and the reward he had in view in doing so.<p>For example, of St. Paul's conformity to Jewish law, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-26.htm" title="Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.">Acts 21:26</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To them that are under the law. . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">To them that are under the Law, as under the Law, not being myself under the Law.</span> These last words are found in all the best MSS., but have been omitted by an oversight of the copyist in the text from which our own translation is made. Those spoken of as "Jews" are, of course, Jews by birth and religion; those "under the Law" are probably proselytes to Judaism. In neither case do they mean Christian converts, for the object of St. Paul's conduct towards those of whom he here speaks was to win them to the Faith of Christ. He himself was no longer "under the Law" being a Christian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Jews I became as a Jew.</span> When, for instance, he circumcised Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-3.htm">Acts 12:3</a>) and probably Titus also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-3.htm">Galatians 2:3</a>; see 'Life of St Paul,' 1. 412, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>); and he was continuing this principle of action when he took the vow of the Nazarite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21-26</a>), and called himself "a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them that are under the Law.</span> That is, not only to Jews, but even to the most rigorous legalists among the Jews. It should be carefully observed that St. Paul is here describing the innocent concessions and compliances which arise from the harmless and generous condescension of a loving spirit. He never sank into the fear of man, which made Peter at Antioch unfaithful to his real principles. He did not allow men to form from his conduct any mistaken inference as to his essential views. He waived his personal predilections in matters of indifference which only affected "the infinitely little." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-23 It is the glory of a minister to deny himself, that he may serve Christ and save souls. But when a minister gives up his right for the sake of the gospel, he does more than his charge and office demands. By preaching the gospel, freely, the apostle showed that he acted from principles of zeal and love, and thus enjoyed much comfort and hope in his soul. And though he looked on the ceremonial law as a yoke taken off by Christ, yet he submitted to it, that he might work upon the Jews, do away their prejudices, prevail with them to hear the gospel, and win them over to Christ. Though he would transgress no laws of Christ, to please any man, yet he would accommodate himself to all men, where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Doing good was the study and business of his life; and, that he might reach this end, he did not stand on privileges. We must carefully watch against extremes, and against relying on any thing but trust in Christ alone. We must not allow errors or faults, so as to hurt others, or disgrace the gospel.</body></html>
