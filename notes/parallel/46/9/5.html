Roman divines have interpreted this as referring to "the custom of Christian matrons attending as sisters upon the Apostles." But as the Apostle illustrates his meaning by a reference to Peter, who we know had a wife, such an interpretation is inadmissible. St. Paul, in this verse, carries his statement of apostolic right to support one step further. Not only had he a right to be supported himself, but the support of the married Apostles and their wives by the Church implied the same right on the part of all. A practice which grew out of a misapprehension of the real meaning of this passage, led to grave scandal, and was finally condemned by the first Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325).<span class= "bld"><p>The brethren of the Lord, and Cephas.</span>--These are mentioned specially, not as distinct from the Apostles (for Cephas, of course, was one), but as examples which would have great weight with the particular Jewish faction to whom this argument was adduced. James was Bishop of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-13.htm" title="And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brothers, listen to me:">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-18.htm" title="And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.">Acts 21:18</a>). The other brethren of our Lord were Joses, Simon, and Judas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a>). They were not of the twelve Apostles, even after their conversion being mentioned as distinct from the Twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>), although James subsequently occupied an apostolic position (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>). Various and ingenious suggestions have been made as to who these "brethren of the Lord" were; amongst others, that they were cousins, or that they were children of Joseph by a former marriage. These views grew out of a desire to establish the perpetual virginity of Mary. The natural conclusion from a study of the mention of their names in the Gospels, without preconceived prejudice, would be that Joseph and Mary lived together after the miraculous birth of Christ, and that these were their children. This, too, is supported by the use of the word <span class= "ital">"first-born"</span> in reference to our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm" title="And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.">Luke 2:7</a>), and the word "till" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>), and "before they came together" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-18.htm" title="Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:18</a>), and the repeated mention of them as brethren in connection with His mother Mary. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To lead about a sister, a wife.</span> There can be no doubt that this represents the true reading, and that the meaning is, "We have power to lead about, that is, to travel in company with, some Christian sister to whom we are married, and who is supported at the expense of the Church." This plain meaning, however, involving the assertion that the apostles and desposyni ("the Lord's brethren") were married men, was so distasteful to the morbid asceticism which held celibacy in a sort of Manichaean reverence, that the scribes of the fourth, fifth, and later centuries freely tampered with the text, in the happily fruitless attempt to get rid of this meaning. They endeavoured, by putting the word in the plural or by omitting "wife," to suggest that the women whom the apostles travelled with were "deaconesses." Augustine, Tertullian, Ambrose, and others explain the verse of "ministering women" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2, 3</a>). The false interpretation avenged itself on the bias which led to it. Valla adopts the wilful invention that the apostles, though married, travelled with their wives only as sisters. Such subterfuges have eaten away the heart of honest exegesis from many passages of Scripture, and originated the taunt that it is a "nose of wax," which readers can twist as they like. It was the cause of such shameful abuses and misrepresentations that at last the practice of travelling about with unmarried women, who went under the name of "sisters," "beloved," "companions," was distinctly forbidden by the third canon of the first Council of Nice. Simon Magus might unblushingly carry about with him a Tyrian woman named Helena; but apostles and true Christians would never have been guilty of any conduct which could give a handle to base suspicions. They travelled only with their wives. <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">sister.</span> A Christian woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">A wife</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a wife. <span class="cmt_word">Other apostles.</span> This is a positive mistranslation for "<span class="accented">the rest of the</span> apostles." It might be too much to infer positively from this that <span class="accented">every one</span> of the apostles and desposyni were married; but there is independent evidence and tradition to show that at any rate most of them were. <span class="cmt_word">The brethren of the Lord.</span> They are clearly and undeniably <span class="accented">distinguished from</span> the apostles. According to the Helvidian theory (to which the plain language of the Gospels seems to point), they were sons of Joseph and Mary. This is the view of St. Clement of Alexandria in ancient times, and writers so different from each other as De Wette, Neander, Osiander, Meyer, Ewald, and Alford, in modern. The theory of Jerome, that they were cousins of Jesus, being sons of Alphseus and Mary, a sister of the Virgin, is on every ground absolutely untenable, and it was half dropped even by St. Jerome himself, when it had served his controversial purpose. The theory of Epiphanius, that they were sons of Joseph by a previous marriage, is possible, but incapable of proof. It comes from a tainted source - the apocryphal Gospels (see my 'Early Days of Christianity,' 2). <span class="cmt_word">Cephas</span>. St. Paul also uses the Aramaic name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>. Peter's wife is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-14.htm">Matthew 8:14</a> and in the tradition of her martyrdom (Clem. Alex., 'Strom.,' 7. &sect; 63). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-14 It is not new for a minister to meet with unkind returns for good-will to a people, and diligent and successful services among them. To the cavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as an example of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marry as well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife, and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good, should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, rather than hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty to maintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but those transgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.</body></html>
