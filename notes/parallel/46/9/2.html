So the Apostle says, "Even if I am not an Apostle to these others, I am, at all events, to you; for you are yourselves the very proof and witness--the seal affixed to my appointment to the Apostolate." The repetition of the words "in the Lord" in both these verses expresses the strong conviction, which is characteristic of the Apostle, that the source of all power and of all success is Christ Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto others.</span> If the emissaries from Jerusalem or the Petrine party do not choose to regard me as <span class="accented">their</span> apostle or an apostle at all, yet at any rate I am <span class="accented">yours. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Doubtless;</span> rather, <span class="accented">at least, at any rate. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The seal of mine apostleship.</span> Your conversion attests the genuineness of my claim, as a seal attests a document.

To the cavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as an example of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marry as well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife, and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good, should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, rather than hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty to maintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but those transgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.</body></html>
