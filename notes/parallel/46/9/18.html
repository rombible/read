It may be said that this was a ground of boasting, not a reward. It was, however, a point to which St. Paul attached the highest importance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33, 34</a>), and he might therefore speak of it, though almost with a touch of half unconscious irony, as his "fee." There is no need to adopt the construction suggested by Meyer: "What is my reward? [none] that I may preach gratuitously;" or that of Afford, who finds the reward in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-23 It is the glory of a minister to deny himself, that he may serve Christ and save souls. But when a minister gives up his right for the sake of the gospel, he does more than his charge and office demands. By preaching the gospel, freely, the apostle showed that he acted from principles of zeal and love, and thus enjoyed much comfort and hope in his soul. And though he looked on the ceremonial law as a yoke taken off by Christ, yet he submitted to it, that he might work upon the Jews, do away their prejudices, prevail with them to hear the gospel, and win them over to Christ. Though he would transgress no laws of Christ, to please any man, yet he would accommodate himself to all men, where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Doing good was the study and business of his life; and, that he might reach this end, he did not stand on privileges. We must carefully watch against extremes, and against relying on any thing but trust in Christ alone. We must not allow errors or faults, so as to hurt others, or disgrace the gospel.</body></html>
