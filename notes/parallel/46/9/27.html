The only other place the word occurs is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-5.htm" title="Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.">Luke 18:5</a>. The body is spoken of as his adversary, or the seat of those lusts and appetites which "war against the mind<span class= "ital">"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Bring it into subjection.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and make it a slave.</span> The idea is carried on that the body is not only conquered, but led captive. We must remember that the language all throughout this passage is figurative, and the statement here refers, not to the infliction of actual pain on the body, but to the subduing of the appetites and passions which are located in it. The true position of our natural appetites is that they should be entirely our servants, and not our masters; that we "should not follow or be led by them," but that they should follow and be led by us.<p><span class= "bld">Lest that by any means.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">lest having been a herald to others, I myself should be rejected.</span> The image is carried on, and the Apostle says that he has a further motive to live a life of self-denial--viz., that he having acted as a herald, proclaiming the conditions of the contest and the requisite preliminaries for it, should not be found to have himself fulfilled them. It is the same image kept up still of this race, and of the herald who announced the name of the victor, and the fact that he had fulfilled the necessary conditions. It was not the custom for the herald to join in the contest, but the Apostle was himself <span class= "ital">both</span> a runner in the Christian course, and a herald of the conditions of that race to others. Hence, naturally, he speaks of the two characters, which in the actual illustration would be distinct, as united in one when applied spiritually to himself. The word "cast away" conveys a wrong impression. The Greek word signifies one who had not behaved according to the prescribed regulations.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I bruise my body, and lead it about as a slave.</span> The word tamely rendered "keep in subjection" means literally, <span class="accented">I smite under the eyes.</span> The pugilistic metaphor is kept up, and the picturesque force of the words would convey a vivid impression to Corinthians familiar with the contests of the Pancratum, in which boxing with the heavy lead-bound <span class="accented">caestus</span> played a prominent part. The only other place in the New Testament where the word occurs is <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-5.htm">Luke 18:5</a>, where it seems (on the lips of the unjust judge) to have a sort of slang sense. How St. Paul "bruised his body" may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>. It was not by absurd and harmful self torture, but by noble labour and self denial for the good of others. <span class="cmt_word">When I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</span> "Lest" - such is the meaning of the metaphor" after proclaiming to others the laws of the contest (as a herald), I should myself violate those conditions, and be not only defeated as a combatant, but ignominiously rejected from the lists and not allowed to contend at all." The metaphor is not strictly adhered to, for the herald did not personally contend. No candidate could compete without a preliminary scrutiny, and to be "rejected" was regarded as a deadly insult The word "rejected," "reprobate" - here rendered "a castaway" - is a metaphor derived from the testing of metals, and the casting aside of those which are spurious. That Paul should see the necessity for such serious and unceasing effort shows how little <span class="accented">he</span> believed in the possibility of saintly "works of supererogation, over and above what is commanded." "When the cedar of Lebanon trembles, what shall the reed by the brookside do?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:24-27 The apostle compares himself to the racers and combatants in the Isthmian games, well known by the Corinthians. But in the Christian race all may run so as to obtain. There is the greatest encouragement, therefore, to persevere with all our strength, in this course. Those who ran in these games were kept to a spare diet. They used themselves to hardships. They practised the exercises. And those who pursue the interests of their souls, must combat hard with fleshly lusts. The body must not be suffered to rule. The apostle presses this advice on the Corinthians. He sets before himself and them the danger of yielding to fleshly desires, pampering the body, and its lusts and appetites. Holy fear of himself was needed to keep an apostle faithful: how much more is it needful for our preservation! Let us learn from hence humility and caution, and to watch against dangers which surround us while in the body.</body></html>
