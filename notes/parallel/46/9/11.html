The spiritual things are, of course, the things of the Spirit of God, by which their spiritual natures are sustained; the carnal things those which the teachers might expect in return, the ordinary support of their physical nature. The force of the climax will be better realised if we notice that the previous argument proved the right of a labourer to receive a remuneration the same in kind as was the quality of his labour. A plougher or a sower would have his reward in a harvest of the same kind as he had sown. That being the principle recognised in civilised life, and sanctioned by the object which the Law of God had in view, the Apostle adds, with a slight touch of sarcasm--Such being an ordinary thing in life, is it a <span class= "ital">great</span> thing for us to have a reward as inferior to our work as carnal things are to spiritual things?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If we.</span> The <span class="accented">we</span> is in both clauses emphatic, to show that the argument applied directly to St. Paul's own case. Is it <span class="cmt_word">a great thing.</span> An argument <span class="accented">a fortiori.</span> If <span class="accented">ordinary</span> labour is not undertaken gratuitously, is the <span class="accented">spiritual</span> labourer to be left to starve? St. Paul always recognized the rights of preachers and ministers, and stated them with emphasis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a>), although from higher motives he waived all personal claim to profit by the result of his arguments. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-14 It is not new for a minister to meet with unkind returns for good-will to a people, and diligent and successful services among them. To the cavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as an example of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marry as well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife, and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good, should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, rather than hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty to maintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but those transgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.</body></html>
