Having established his right to be called an Apostle by the fact that he had seen the Lord, and had been instrumental in their conversion, he now in the same interrogative style asserts his rights as an Apostle. The use of the plural "we" carries on the thought that he is claiming this right as being one of the Apostles--all of whom have, as Apostles, such a right. The form in which the question is asked implies, Surely we have this right. This verse, taken in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.">1Corinthians 8:9</a>, where the same word in the Greek, "liberty," occurs in connection with eating, shows how this line of thought has grown out of the preceding subject. The question there, however, was that of eating meat offered to idols; the question here is the right to eat and drink (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> live) at the expense of the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm" title="And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire.

To the cavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as an example of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marry as well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife, and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good, should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, rather than hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty to maintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but those transgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.</body></html>
