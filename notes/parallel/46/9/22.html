The whole passage treats of the attitude which the Apostle assumed towards various classes outside the Christian Church, that he might gain them as converts. The words "I became," which have introduced the various classes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;">1Corinthians 9:20</a>, are here again repeated, and this passage seems to be an explanation and reiteration of what had gone before. "It was to the weak points (not to the strong points) of Jews, proselytes, and Gentiles that I assimilated myself. To the weak ones among all these classes I became weak, that I might gain those weak ones."<p><span class= "bld">I am made all things to all. . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I am become all things to all men that I should save at least some.</span> Although he had thus accommodated himself, so far as was possible, consistently with Christian duty, to the weaknesses of all, he could only hope to win some of them. The natural climax would have been--"I become all things to all men that I might win <span class= "ital">all."</span> But the Apostle's humility could not let him dare to hope for so great a reward as that. All the self-sacrifice he could make was necessary to gain "at all events some," and that would be his ample reward. The word "save" means "win over to Christianity," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-16.htm" title="For what know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how know you, O man, whether you shall save your wife?">1Corinthians 7:16</a>, and is used here instead of the previous word "gain," being repeated to prevent any possible perversion of the Apostle's meaning as to "gaining men." His subject was not, as enemies might suggest, to win them to himself--but to Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the weak.</span> His whole argument here is a plea for condescension to the infirmities of weak converts. A similar condescension to their prejudices might be necessary to win them to Christianity at all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>; "We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>). St. Paul often touches on our duties to weak brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-1.htm">Romans 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All things to all men.</span> He repeats the same principle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-33.htm">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>, "I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved;" and once more, at the end of his course (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>). This condescension laid him open to the malicious attacks of religious enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). But not on that account would St. Paul ever be led to abandon the fruitful aid of that universal sympathy and tolerance which is one of the best tests of Christian love. <span class="cmt_word">That I might by all means save some.</span> He adds this explanation of the motive of his condescension to various scruples <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) lest any should accuse him of men pleasing, as some of his Galatian opponents had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). In his desire to win souls he acted with the wisdom and sympathy taught by experience, suppressing himself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-23 It is the glory of a minister to deny himself, that he may serve Christ and save souls. But when a minister gives up his right for the sake of the gospel, he does more than his charge and office demands. By preaching the gospel, freely, the apostle showed that he acted from principles of zeal and love, and thus enjoyed much comfort and hope in his soul. And though he looked on the ceremonial law as a yoke taken off by Christ, yet he submitted to it, that he might work upon the Jews, do away their prejudices, prevail with them to hear the gospel, and win them over to Christ. Though he would transgress no laws of Christ, to please any man, yet he would accommodate himself to all men, where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Doing good was the study and business of his life; and, that he might reach this end, he did not stand on privileges. We must carefully watch against extremes, and against relying on any thing but trust in Christ alone. We must not allow errors or faults, so as to hurt others, or disgrace the gospel.</body></html>
