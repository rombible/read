Thus the thought grows more naturally out of the previous chapter than it seems to do in the English version. He had mentioned his solemn resolve to give up a freedom to which he had a right in regard to eating meat. He had on another occasion, in regard to his right of maintenance by the Church, also voluntarily sacrificed his freedom, and the Jewish party had in consequence denied the existence of the rights, and questioned his apostolic dignity. He asks, with abrupt emphasis, "Was it because I am not free to demand such support? My freedom in this case is as real as in that other case when you questioned it, and to which I shall now refer. Was it because I am not an Apostle?"<p><span class= "bld">Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord</span>?<span class= "ital">--</span>To have seen Christ was a necessary qualification for the Apostolate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-21.htm" title="Why of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,">Acts 1:21</a>). From the manner in which the Apostle here asks the question, and does not answer it, it would seem that although some small minority might, for some party purpose, have at some time questioned it, yet that the fact was generally admitted and universally known that St. Paul did actually see the Lord at the time of his conversion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4</a>), and on other occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Are not</span> <span class= "bld">ye</span> <span class= "bld">my work in the Lord?</span>--This is a further proof of his Apostleship, and therefore of his right or freedom to have demanded support from the Church. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1Corinthians 4:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-27.</span> - The rights and the self denial of an apostle. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - An apostle's right to maintenance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Am I not an apostle I am I not free?</span> The order of the best manuscripts is, <span class="accented">Am I not free? am I not an apostle?</span> St. Paul designed in this chapter to show that he was not only <span class="accented">giving a precept</span>, but <span class="accented">setting an example</span>, He told the "strong" Corinthians, who had "knowledge," that they should be ready to abnegate their rights for the good of others, he now wishes to show them that, in a matter which affected his whole life, he had himself abnegated his own rights. Being free and an apostle, he could, if he had chosen, have claimed, as others had done, a right to be supported by the Churches to which he preached, he had thought it more for their good to waive this claim, and therefore he had done so at the cost (as appears in many other passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>) of bitter hardship to himself. But St. Paul practically "goes off" at the word "apostle." It was so essential for him to vindicate, against the subterranean malignity of hostile partisans, his dignity as an apostle, that in asserting that authority he almost loses sight for the time of the main object for which he had alluded to the fact. Hence much that he says is of the nature of a digression - though an important one - until he resumes the main thread of his subject at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-15.htm">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?</span> Doubtless he mainly refers to the vision on the road to Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>), though he received other visions and revelations also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a>, etc.). he had probably not seen Christ during his life on earth (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:73-75). The words are added to remind them that those who boasted of personal knowledge and relation with Jesus - perhaps the Christ party - had no <span class="accented">exclusive</span> prerogative. <span class="cmt_word">Are not ye my work in the Lord?</span> I am not only an apostle, but emphatically <span class="accented">your</span> apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-14 It is not new for a minister to meet with unkind returns for good-will to a people, and diligent and successful services among them. To the cavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as an example of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marry as well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife, and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good, should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, rather than hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty to maintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but those transgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.</body></html>
