There is, however, a great variety of readings as to the actual mode of expression of this thought. One suggestion is that the words may read thus:--"It were better for me to die than (receive reward from you); no man shall make my ground of boasting void." Another is; "It were better for me to die, rather than any one should make my ground of boasting void." There is great weight in favour of both of these readings. The following have also been suggested as possible readings of the passage:--"It were better for me to die than that my ground of boasting should die; no one shall make it void;" and "It were better for me to die than that my ground of boasting ----; no man shall make it void." In this last case the Apostle pauses in the middle of his impassioned declaration, and leaves the sentence unfinished, as he flings aside the thought that his ground of boasting could be removed, and exclaims earnestly and emphatically, "No man <span class= "ital">shall</span> make it void." Perhaps, on the whole, especially having regard to the character of the writer, this last rendering is most likely to be the true one. In any case, the general drift and meaning of the passage is the same. The Apostle would rather die than lose his ground of boasting, and he boldly asserts his determination to let no one deprive him of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-23.</span> - <span class="accented">Self denying ordinance of St. Paul.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have used none of these things</span>. None of the forms of right which I might claim from these many sanctions. He is appealing to his own abandonment of a right to encourage them to waive, if need required, the claims of their Christian liberty. His object in waiving his plain right was that he might give no handle to any who might desire to accuse him of interested motives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-4.htm">1 Corinthians 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Have I written;</span> rather, <span class="accented">do I write</span>; the epistolary aorist. <span class="cmt_word">That it should be so done unto me.</span> Do not take my argument as a hint to you that you have neglected your duty of maintaining me, and have even seen me suffer without offering me your assistance. <span class="cmt_word">Better for me to die.</span> Not "to die of hunger," as Chrysostom supposes, but generally, "I should prefer death to the loss of my independence of attitude towards my converts." <span class="cmt_word">Than that any man should make my glorying void.</span> The Greek is remarkable.

But when a minister gives up his right for the sake of the gospel, he does more than his charge and office demands. By preaching the gospel, freely, the apostle showed that he acted from principles of zeal and love, and thus enjoyed much comfort and hope in his soul. And though he looked on the ceremonial law as a yoke taken off by Christ, yet he submitted to it, that he might work upon the Jews, do away their prejudices, prevail with them to hear the gospel, and win them over to Christ. Though he would transgress no laws of Christ, to please any man, yet he would accommodate himself to all men, where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Doing good was the study and business of his life; and, that he might reach this end, he did not stand on privileges. We must carefully watch against extremes, and against relying on any thing but trust in Christ alone. We must not allow errors or faults, so as to hurt others, or disgrace the gospel.</body></html>
