(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm" title="Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.">Galatians 6:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To them that are without law, as without law.</span> In other words, I so far became to the heathen as a heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>), that I never wilfully insulted their beliefs (Acts 19:87) nor shocked their prejudices, but on the contrary, judged them with perfect forbearance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>) and treated them with invariable courtesy. St, Paul tried to look at every subject, so far as he could do so innocently, from 'their point of view (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>.). He defended their gospel liberty, and had intercourse with Gentile converts on terms of perfect equality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not without law to God.</span> Not even "without law" (<span class="accented">anomos</span>) Much less "opposed to law" (<span class="accented">antiheroes</span>), though free from it as a bondage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>). The need for this qualification is shown by the fact that in the Clementine writings, in the spurious letter of Peter to James, St. Paul is surreptitiously calumniated as <span class="accented">"the lawless one</span>." Even the Gentiles were "not without law to God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14, 15</a>). So that St. Paul is here using language which base opponents might distort, but which the common sense of honest readers would prevent them from misinterpreting. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:15-23 It is the glory of a minister to deny himself, that he may serve Christ and save souls. But when a minister gives up his right for the sake of the gospel, he does more than his charge and office demands. By preaching the gospel, freely, the apostle showed that he acted from principles of zeal and love, and thus enjoyed much comfort and hope in his soul. And though he looked on the ceremonial law as a yoke taken off by Christ, yet he submitted to it, that he might work upon the Jews, do away their prejudices, prevail with them to hear the gospel, and win them over to Christ. Though he would transgress no laws of Christ, to please any man, yet he would accommodate himself to all men, where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Doing good was the study and business of his life; and, that he might reach this end, he did not stand on privileges. We must carefully watch against extremes, and against relying on any thing but trust in Christ alone. We must not allow errors or faults, so as to hurt others, or disgrace the gospel.</body></html>
