The following division (Meyer's) of the gifts which are here mentioned is, perhaps, the best approach to a classification which can be made. In the Greek the genera (so to speak) are divided by the word <span class= "ital">hetero,</span> the species by <span class= "ital">allo,</span> both words being rendered in the English by the one word "another ":--<p>I.Gifts which have reference to intellectual power.<p>(1)The word of wisdom.<p>(2)The word of knowledge.<p>II.Gifts which depend upon special energy of faith.<p>(1) The faith itself.<p>(2) Operating in deeds.<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>)Healings.<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>)Miracles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The word of wisdom... the word of knowledge.</span> In modern usage, "knowledge" is the learning which we by use and effort acquire; "wisdom" is the insight which gradually dawns upon us from thought and experience. In the language of the New Testament, the distinction between the two words is not so clearly marked, but" wisdom" seems to belong more to the human <span class="accented">spirit</span>, and "knowledge "to the <span class="accented">intellect.</span> The "discourse of wisdom" would be that which sets forth the truth of the gospel persuasively to work conversion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>); the "discourse of knowledge" would be that which enters into the speculative and theoretical elaboration of systematic theology. The first might find its illustration in the 'Imitatio Christi;' the second in the 'Summa Theologiae.' <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-11 Spiritual gifts were extraordinary powers bestowed in the first ages, to convince unbelievers, and to spread the gospel. Gifts and graces greatly differ. Both were freely given of God. But where grace is given, it is for the salvation of those who have it. Gifts are for the advantage and salvation of others; and there may be great gifts where there is no grace. The extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit were chiefly exercised in the public assemblies, where the Corinthians seem to have made displays of them, wanting in the spirit of piety, and of Christian love. While heathens, they had not been influenced by the Spirit of Christ. No man can call Christ Lord, with believing dependence upon him, unless that faith is wrought by the Holy Ghost. No man could believe with his heart, or prove by a miracle, that Jesus was Christ, unless by the Holy Ghost. There are various gifts, and various offices to perform, but all proceed from one God, one Lord, one Spirit; that is, from the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the origin of all spiritual blessings. No man has them merely for himself. The more he profits others, the more will they turn to his own account. The gifts mentioned appear to mean exact understanding, and uttering the doctrines of the Christian religion; the knowledge of mysteries, and skill to give advice and counsel. Also the gift of healing the sick, the working of miracles, and to explain Scripture by a peculiar gift of the Spirit, and ability to speak and interpret languages. If we have any knowledge of the truth, or any power to make it known, we must give all the glory of God. The greater the gifts are, the more the possessor is exposed to temptations, and the larger is the measure of grace needed to keep him humble and spiritual; and he will meet with more painful experiences and humbling dispensations. We have little cause to glory in any gifts bestowed on us, or to despise those who have them not.</body></html>
