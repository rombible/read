Wise spiritual preachers. It is instructive to note that St. Paul places the gifts of wisdom and knowledge which these preachers require above those which we are apt to regard as exclusively miraculous. The "wonders" stood in a lower, not in a higher, position when compared with the ordinary gifts of grace. <span class="cmt_word">Teachers</span>. Those who have the minor gifts of instruction and exposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Helps</span>. All the services rendered by the power of active sympathy; by the work of deacons, sisters of mercy, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3, 4</a>). The word occurs in 2 Macc. 8:19; Ecclus. 11:12, and the corresponding verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-54.htm">Luke 1:54</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Governments.</span> Powers of leading and organization. <span class="cmt_word">Diversities [kinds] of tongues.</span> Ranked as <span class="accented">last</span> in value. They are emotional gifts, which had only a very subordinate part in the work of edification, and are, therefore, placed below the gifts of knowledge, of power, and of practical life, which sum up the previous enumeration. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:27-31 Contempt, hatred, envy, and strife, are very unnatural in Christians. It is like the members of the same body being without concern for one another, or quarrelling with each other. The proud, contentious spirit that prevailed, as to spiritual gifts, was thus condemned. The offices and gifts, or favours, dispensed by the Holy Spirit, are noticed. Chief ministers; persons enabled to interpret Scripture; those who laboured in word and doctrine; those who had power to heal diseases; such as helped the sick and weak; such as disposed of the money given in charity by the church, and managed the affairs of the church; and such as could speak divers languages. What holds the last and lowest rank in this list, is the power to speak languages; how vain, if a man does so merely to amuse or to exalt himself! See the distribution of these gifts, not to every one alike, ver. 29,30. This were to make the church all one, as if the body were all ear, or all eye. The Spirit distributes to every one as he will. We must be content though we are lower and less than others. We must not despise others, if we have greater gifts. How blessed the Christian church, if all the members did their duty! Instead of coveting the highest stations, or the most splendid gifts, let us leave the appointment of his instruments to God, and those in whom he works by his providence. Remember, those will not be approved hereafter who seek the chief places, but those who are most faithful to the trust placed in them, and most diligent in their Master's work.</body></html>
