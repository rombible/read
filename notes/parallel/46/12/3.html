The phrase is a Hebrew one to describe inspiration. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus accursed.</span> It may well seem amazing that the Corinthians should need instructing that such awful language could not be uttered by any one speaking "in the Spirit of God." It is evident, however, that such expressions <span class="accented">had</span> been uttered by persons who were, or seemed to be, carried away by the impassioned impulse which led to "glossolaly." (It is better to use this technical word in order to dissipate the cloud of strange misconceptions as to the true nature of this <span class="accented">charism.</span>) So terrible an outrage on the conscience of Christians could never have passed unchecked and unpunished, except from the obvious inability of the young community to grapple with the new and perplexing phenomena of an "inspiration" which appeared to destroy the personal control of those possessed by it. Among Jewish converts glossolaly was regarded as a form of that wild mantle "inspiration" of which we find some traces in Jewish history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23, 24</a>, etc.), and which was alluded to in the very name <span class="accented">Nabo</span>, which implied a boiling energy. Among Gentile converts the glossolaly would be classed with the overmastering influences of which they read, or which they witnessed, in the Sibyls, the Pythian priestesses, and the wild orgiastic devotees of Eastern cults. They would not like to call any one to task for things spoken in a condition which they regarded as wholly supernatural. As to the speakers, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> some of them, not being sincere, might have really fallen under the influence of impulses which were earthly and demonish, not Divine; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> others, not duly controlling their own genuine impulse, may have been liable to the uncontrolled sway of utterances for which they were at the moment irresponsible; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> or again, being incapable of reasoned expression, they may have audibly expressed vague Gnostic doubts as to the identity of the "Jesus" who was crucified and the Divine Word; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> they may have been entangled in Jewish perplexities rising from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, "He that is hanged" (which was also the expression applied by Jews to the crucified) "is accursed of God;" or finally, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> by some strange abuse of the true principle expressed by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>, they may have asserted in this fearful form their emancipation from the acknowledgment of Jesus "after the flesh." Similar phenomena - the same intrusions into worship of downright blasphemy or of blasphemous familiarity - have constantly recurred at times of overwhelming spiritual excitement, as for instance m the adherents of the "everlasting gospel" in the thirteenth century, and in various movements of our own day. <span class="accented">Is accursed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is anathema.</span> The word corresponds to the Hebrew <span class="accented">cherem</span>, which means "a ban," and "what is devoted or set apart by a ban;" and to the Latin <span class="accented">sacer</span>, which means not only "sacred," set apart by holy consecration, but also "devoted to destruction." <span class="cmt_word">No man can say that Jesus is [the] Lord, but by [in] the Holy Ghost.</span> It involved a strong rebuke to the <span class="accented">illuminati</span>, who professed a profound spiritual insight, to tell them that no man could make the simple, humble confession of the divinity of Jesus (for "Lord" is here an equivalent of the Hebrew "Jehovah") except by the same inspiration as that which they so terribly abused. There is a very similar passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>; but there the "test" of the inspiration is a confession of the humanity of Jesus as against Gnostics, who treated his human life as purely phantasmal. Here the test is the confession of his divinity as against Jews and Gentiles. (For a parallel passage, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee.") <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-11 Spiritual gifts were extraordinary powers bestowed in the first ages, to convince unbelievers, and to spread the gospel. Gifts and graces greatly differ. Both were freely given of God. But where grace is given, it is for the salvation of those who have it. Gifts are for the advantage and salvation of others; and there may be great gifts where there is no grace. The extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit were chiefly exercised in the public assemblies, where the Corinthians seem to have made displays of them, wanting in the spirit of piety, and of Christian love. While heathens, they had not been influenced by the Spirit of Christ. No man can call Christ Lord, with believing dependence upon him, unless that faith is wrought by the Holy Ghost. No man could believe with his heart, or prove by a miracle, that Jesus was Christ, unless by the Holy Ghost. There are various gifts, and various offices to perform, but all proceed from one God, one Lord, one Spirit; that is, from the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the origin of all spiritual blessings. No man has them merely for himself. The more he profits others, the more will they turn to his own account. The gifts mentioned appear to mean exact understanding, and uttering the doctrines of the Christian religion; the knowledge of mysteries, and skill to give advice and counsel. Also the gift of healing the sick, the working of miracles, and to explain Scripture by a peculiar gift of the Spirit, and ability to speak and interpret languages. If we have any knowledge of the truth, or any power to make it known, we must give all the glory of God. The greater the gifts are, the more the possessor is exposed to temptations, and the larger is the measure of grace needed to keep him humble and spiritual; and he will meet with more painful experiences and humbling dispensations. We have little cause to glory in any gifts bestowed on us, or to despise those who have them not.</body></html>
