They make a man his own deadliest enemy. <span class="cmt_word">Every sin... is without the body.</span> Some have supposed that this cannot apply to gluttony and drunkenness, which they therefore class with fornication; but even in those sins, as in suicide, the <span class="accented">cause</span> of and <span class="accented">incentive to</span> the sin is external, whereas the source of uncleanness is in the heart and in the thoughts, which come from within, and so defile the man. Other sins may be <span class="accented">with</span> and <span class="accented">by means of</span> the body, and may <span class="accented">injure</span> the body; but none are so directly against the sanctity of the whole bodily being as fornication. <span class="cmt_word">Sinneth against his own body.</span> By alienating it from the service of him to whom it belongs; by incorporating it with the degradation of another; by staining the flesh and the body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-8.htm">Proverbs 5:8-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-24.htm">Proverbs 7:24-27</a>); by subtly poisoning the inmost sanctities of his own being. St. Paul is here thinking mainly, however, if not exclusively, of the <span class="accented">moral</span> injury and defilement. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-20 Some among the Corinthians seem to have been ready to say, All things are lawful for me. This dangerous conceit St. Paul opposes. There is a liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, in which we must stand fast. But surely a Christian would never put himself into the power of any bodily appetite. The body is for the Lord; is to be an instrument of righteousness to holiness, therefore is never to be made an instrument of sin. It is an honour to the body, that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead; and it will be an honour to our bodies, that they will be raised. The hope of a resurrection to glory, should keep Christians from dishonouring their bodies by fleshly lusts. And if the soul be united to Christ by faith, the whole man is become a member of his spiritual body. Other vices may be conquered in fight; that here cautioned against, only by flight. And vast multitudes are cut off by this vice in its various forms and consequences. Its effects fall not only directly upon the body, but often upon the mind. Our bodies have been redeemed from deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by the atoning sacrifice of Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted for our Master's use. Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought with a price of unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself as wholly the Lord's, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business, to the latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with our bodies, and with our spirits which are his.</body></html>
