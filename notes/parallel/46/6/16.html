"Do you not know that my strong assertion is true? It is not merely my statement; it is to be found in the Old Testament, 'Two shall be one flesh.'" This was originally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>) applied to marriage, as showing the intimacy of that sacred union, but here St. Paul applies it to one aspect of a union which, in one respect, was identical with marriage. Of course the other parts of the Apostle's argument do not apply to marriage, the union being a sacred one; two becoming one flesh in marriage is no degradation of a member of Christ--nay, it is a sacred illustration of the complete unity of Christ and His body the Church. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-29.htm" title="For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.">1Corinthians 11:29</a>, and Notes there.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What, know ye not,</span> etc.? The clause is used to explain and justify the strong expression which he had used in the previous verse. It involves an argument against the sin which is the most original and impressive which could have been used. To this passage especially is due the tone taken by Christians as to these sins, which differed so totally from that taken by heathen. <span class="cmt_word">They two.</span> The words do not occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, but are always so quoted in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-5.htm">Matthew 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-8.htm">Mark 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saith he.</span> This is a vague Jewish formula of quotation, adopted to avoid the needless introduction of the sacred Name.

This dangerous conceit St. Paul opposes. There is a liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, in which we must stand fast. But surely a Christian would never put himself into the power of any bodily appetite. The body is for the Lord; is to be an instrument of righteousness to holiness, therefore is never to be made an instrument of sin. It is an honour to the body, that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead; and it will be an honour to our bodies, that they will be raised. The hope of a resurrection to glory, should keep Christians from dishonouring their bodies by fleshly lusts. And if the soul be united to Christ by faith, the whole man is become a member of his spiritual body. Other vices may be conquered in fight; that here cautioned against, only by flight. And vast multitudes are cut off by this vice in its various forms and consequences. Its effects fall not only directly upon the body, but often upon the mind. Our bodies have been redeemed from deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by the atoning sacrifice of Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted for our Master's use. Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought with a price of unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself as wholly the Lord's, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business, to the latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with our bodies, and with our spirits which are his.</body></html>
