Lawful matters are to be decided upon the highest principle of expediency; but fornication is an unlawful matter, and therefore the question of its expediency does not arise at all. The stomach is adapted to the digestion of food, and food is adapted to it. This is, however, only for this life; both shall be destroyed by death. But the person ("body" being equivalent to "us" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.">1Corinthians 6:14</a>) of the man is enduring. No food which enters defiles <span class= "ital">the man.</span> Fornication is not a mere transitory gratification; it affects <span class= "ital">the man.</span> The use of the stomach is to receive and digest food, and only the animal organisation is affected by that. It cannot be said that the man is made for fornication. The person of each is made for the Lord; the whole Church is His body; each baptised person is a limb of that body; and the Lord is for the body. He came to earth and died for it, and for each member of it; therefore what affects that body, or any member of that body (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> any Christian), cannot be an indifferent matter. Neither shall the man perish, as meats and the belly shall; he is immortal. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-52</a>.) Such seems to be the argument by which St. Paul maintains liberty to be right regarding meats, and shows that the same principle does not apply to sensual indulgence. It may be put argumentatively thus:<p>1. Eating meats offered to idols is an "indifferent matter," because--<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>) Meats only affect the particular organ designed for them;<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) Meats and that organ shall perish together.<p>2. Fornication is not an "indifferent matter," because--<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>) It affects the man, and he is not designed for the purpose of this indulgence,<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) The man is immortal, and therefore the moral effect of the fornication on his nature does not perish at his death.<p><span class= "ital">Conclusion.</span>--Only indifferent matters are to be the subject of Christian liberty; and the decision must be according to the utility of each act. Fornication is not an indifferent matter; therefore it is not so to be decided upon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Meats for the belly,</span> etc. The argument of the Corinthians about the indifference of eating "meats" which were merely ceremonially unclean was quite tenable. Things Levitically unclean might be essentially pure, and both food and the body which lives thereby are things "which perish in the using" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-22.htm">Colossians 2:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall destroy;</span> <span class="accented">shall bring to nought.</span> This would occur when the physical body becomes a spiritual body, like that of the angels of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51, 52</a>). How vile, then, is it to make a god of the belly - only to sleep and feed! <span class="cmt_word">Both it and them.</span> There shall be no need for <span class="accented">the belly</span> when men "shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16</a>); and the meat alluded to is "meat which perisheth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-16.htm">Luke 15:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now the body is net for fornication, but for the Lord.</span> The argument, therefore, which would class this sin as a matter of indifference, as was the Levitical distinction between different kinds of food, at once fell to the ground. Food was a necessity, and the stomach was formed for its assimilation. Fornication is not a venial but "a <span class="accented">deadly</span> sin." It is not a natural necessity, but a consuming evil. The body was created for higher ends - namely, to be a temple of God. "God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord for the body.</span> Therefore our members ought to be used "as instruments of righteousness unto God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13</a>), and our bodies presented as a living, holy, reasonable, acceptable sacrifice to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The end of our existence is "to serve God here and enjoy him forever hereafter." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-20 Some among the Corinthians seem to have been ready to say, All things are lawful for me. This dangerous conceit St. Paul opposes. There is a liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, in which we must stand fast. But surely a Christian would never put himself into the power of any bodily appetite. The body is for the Lord; is to be an instrument of righteousness to holiness, therefore is never to be made an instrument of sin. It is an honour to the body, that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead; and it will be an honour to our bodies, that they will be raised. The hope of a resurrection to glory, should keep Christians from dishonouring their bodies by fleshly lusts. And if the soul be united to Christ by faith, the whole man is become a member of his spiritual body. Other vices may be conquered in fight; that here cautioned against, only by flight. And vast multitudes are cut off by this vice in its various forms and consequences. Its effects fall not only directly upon the body, but often upon the mind. Our bodies have been redeemed from deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by the atoning sacrifice of Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted for our Master's use. Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought with a price of unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself as wholly the Lord's, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business, to the latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with our bodies, and with our spirits which are his.</body></html>
