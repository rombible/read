St. Paul, therefore, boldly repeats it, and proceeds to show that it is a maxim of Christian liberty, which does not refer to matters which are absolutely wrong, and that even in its application to indifferent matters it must be limited, and guarded by other Christian principles. "The eating of things sacrificed to idols (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.">1Corinthians 8:4</a>), and the committing fornication," were two subjects of discussion closely connected with heathen worship; and it may seem astonishing to us now that because St. Paul had maintained the right of individual liberty concerning the former, he should perhaps have been quoted as an authority for liberty regarding the latter, yet it is a matter of fact that such a mode of reasoning was not uncommon. They were both regarded as part and parcel of heathen worship, and therefore, as it were, to stand or fall together, as being matters vital or indifferent. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.">Acts 15:29</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-14.htm" title="The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly.">Revelation 11:14</a>, as illustrations of the union of the two for purposes respectively of condemnation and of improper toleration.) We must not regard the use of the singular "me" as being in any sense a limitation of the principle to the Apostle personally. "Paul often speaks in the first person singular, which has the force of a moral maxim, especially in this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.">1Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.">1Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.">1Corinthians 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1Corinthians 10:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-29.htm" title="Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?">1Corinthians 10:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-11.htm" title="Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.">1Corinthians 14:11</a>)" (Bengel). The words refer to all Christians.<p><span class= "bld">All things are not expedient.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">all things are not profitable.</span> The word "expedient" in its highest sense is a proper translation of the Greeks, but in modern use it has a somewhat lower and depreciatory meaning generally attached to it.<p><span class= "bld">All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span>--There is a verbal contrast in the Greek here which can scarcely be rendered fully in English. The Greek words for "unlawful" and "be brought under the power of" are cognate words. What the Apostle says is, "All things are lawful for me, but I am not the one to allow them therefore to become a law over me." There is such a thing as becoming the very slave of liberty itself. If we sacrifice the power of choice which is implied in the thought of liberty, we cease to be free; we are brought <span class= "ital">under</span> the power of that which should be <span class= "ital">in</span> our power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-20.</span> - <span class="accented">The inexcusable sin and shame of fornication.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things are lawful unto me.</span> The abruptness with which the phrase is introduced perhaps shows that, in the letter of the Corinthians to St. Paul, they had used some such expression by way of palliating their lax tolerance of violations of the law of purity. By "all things," of course, is only meant "all things which are indifferent in themselves." They erroneously applied this maxim of Christian liberty to that which was inherently sinful, and thus were tempted to "make their liberty a cloak of viciousness." St. Paul, as Bengel observes, often, and especially in this Epistle, uses the first person <span class="accented">generally</span> in gnomic or semi-proverbial sentences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23, 29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-11.htm">1 Corinthians 14:11</a>). But. This is St. Paul's correction of too broad a formula. <span class="cmt_word">Are not expedient.</span> St. Paul illustrates this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8-10</a>. We have no right to do even that which is innocent, if it be disadvantageous to the highest interests of ourselves or others. "He alone," says St. Augustine, "does not fall into unlawful things who sometimes abstains by way of caution even from lawful ones." <span class="cmt_word">Will</span> <span class="cmt_word">not be brought under the power.</span> The play of words in the original might be imitated by saying, "All things are in my power, but I will not be brought under the power of any." In other words, "boundless intemperance" may become a tyranny. The pretence of moral freedom may end in a moral bondage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Obedience is better than freedom? What's free?<br />The vexed foam on the wave, the tossed straw on the sea;<br />The ocean itself, as it rages and swells,<br />In the bonds of a boundless obedience dwells."</span> I will be master even over my liberty by keeping it under the beneficent control of law and of charity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-20 Some among the Corinthians seem to have been ready to say, All things are lawful for me. This dangerous conceit St. Paul opposes. There is a liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, in which we must stand fast. But surely a Christian would never put himself into the power of any bodily appetite. The body is for the Lord; is to be an instrument of righteousness to holiness, therefore is never to be made an instrument of sin. It is an honour to the body, that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead; and it will be an honour to our bodies, that they will be raised. The hope of a resurrection to glory, should keep Christians from dishonouring their bodies by fleshly lusts. And if the soul be united to Christ by faith, the whole man is become a member of his spiritual body. Other vices may be conquered in fight; that here cautioned against, only by flight. And vast multitudes are cut off by this vice in its various forms and consequences. Its effects fall not only directly upon the body, but often upon the mind. Our bodies have been redeemed from deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by the atoning sacrifice of Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted for our Master's use. Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought with a price of unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself as wholly the Lord's, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business, to the latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with our bodies, and with our spirits which are his.</body></html>
