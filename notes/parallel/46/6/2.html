Bearing in mind the deep conviction of the early Church that the second personal advent of Christ was near at hand, we may take these words as referring primarily to the conquest of the world by Christianity, which has since been accomplished, though by slower and more spiritual processes than were then anticipated, and indirectly to that final triumph of Christ and His body, the Church, of which every success here on earth is at once the type and the pledge.<p><span class= "bld">To judge the smallest matters.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to pronounce the most trivial judgments,</span> as compared with the great judgments which you shall pronounce hereafter. The nature of the things which form the subject of those judgments is explained in the following verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do ye not know?</span> The word "or" should be supplied from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, D, F, etc. Bishop Wordsworth points out that this emphatic question occurs ten times in these two Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2, 3, 9, 15, 16, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13, 24</a>), and only twice in all the rest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>). It was a fitting rebuke to those who took for knowledge their obvious ignorance. It resembles the "Have ye not so much as read?" to Pharisees who professed such profound familiarity with the Scriptures. <span class="cmt_word">That the saints shall judge the world</span>. So Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a>) had said, "The Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High." Our Lord had confirmed this promise to his apostles, "Ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>). Various modes of evading the literal sense have been adopted, but even in the Book of Wisdom we find, "They [the righteous] shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people" (Wisd. 3:8). All speculation as to the manner and extent in which the saints shall share in the work of Christ as Judge of the quick and dead, are obviously futile. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be judged;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is being judged -</span> the present points to the future, as though that which is inevitable is already in course of fulfilment. <span class="cmt_word">To judge the smallest matters;</span> literally, <span class="accented">of the smallest judgments.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Christians should not contend with one another, for they are brethren. This, if duly attended to, would prevent many law-suits, and end many quarrels and disputes. In matters of great damage to ourselves or families, we may use lawful means to right ourselves, but Christians should be of a forgiving temper. Refer the matters in dispute, rather than go to law about them. They are trifles, and may easily be settled, if you first conquer your own spirits. Bear and forbear, and the men of least skill among you may end your quarrels. It is a shame that little quarrels should grow to such a head among Christians, that they cannot be determined by the brethren. The peace of a man's own mind, and the calm of his neighbourhood, are worth more than victory. Lawsuits could not take place among brethren, unless there were faults among them.</body></html>
