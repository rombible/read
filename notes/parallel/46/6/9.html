"You do wrong, apparently forgetting that no wrongdoers shall inherit God's kingdom."<p><span class= "bld">Be not deceived.</span>--There was great danger of their being led to think lightly of sins which were daily committed by those amongst whom they lived, hence these words of warning with which the sentence opens, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-33.htm" title="Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.">1Corinthians 15:33</a>. The mention of gross sensual sins in connection with idolaters points to the fact that they were practically associated in the ritual of the heathen, which, of course, intensified the danger against which the Apostle warns the Corinthians. The prevalence of such scandalous crimes in the heathen world is constantly referred to in the Epistles to Gentile churches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for murderers,">1Timothy 1:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Know ye not;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Or know ye not</span>, as before. Are you defying God, or does your sin arise from mere ignorance? <span class="cmt_word">The unrighteous;</span> better, <span class="accented">that wrong doers</span>, the verb being the same as "ye do wrong" in ver. 8. Perhaps the Corinthians thought that they would be saved by the mere fact of having been admitted into God's kingdom (the Christian Church in all its highest privileges) by baptism. St. Paul here lays down, as distinctly as St. James does, that faith without works is dead, and privileges without holiness are abrogated. The spirit of his warning is the same as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>, "Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord... are these;" or that of St. John the Baptist, "Say not unto yourselves, We be Abraham's sons." Christians have often been liable to the temptation of underrating the peril which results from the falling asunder of action from knowledge. There can be no greater danger than that of talking slightingly of "mere morality." Religion is not an outward service, but a spiritual life manifested by a holy living. <span class="cmt_word">Be not deceived.</span> So our Lord says," Let no man deceive you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-5.htm">Mark 13:5</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). St. Paul uses the warning very solemnly again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, and St. James in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-16.htm">James 1:16</a>. The self deception of merely verbal orthodoxy is the most dangerous of all. <span class="cmt_word">Neither fornicators</span>. The first four classes of sinners were specially prevalent at Corinth, where, indeed, impurity formed part of the recognized cult of the local Aphrodite (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>). Lists of these "works of the flesh," which were the all but universal curse and stain of heathendom, occur also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5-7</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-11 The Corinthians are warned against many great evils, of which they had formerly been guilty. There is much force in these inquiries, when we consider that they were addressed to a people puffed up with a fancy of their being above others in wisdom and knowledge. All unrighteousness is sin; all reigning sin, nay, every actual sin, committed with design, and not repented of, shuts out of the kingdom of heaven. Be not deceived. Men are very much inclined to flatter themselves that they may live in sin, yet die in Christ, and go to heaven. But we cannot hope to sow to the flesh, and reap everlasting life. They are reminded what a change the gospel and grace of God had made in them. The blood of Christ, and the washing of regeneration, can take away all guilt. Our justification is owing to the suffering and merit of Christ; our sanctification to the working of the Holy Spirit; but both go together. All who are made righteous in the sight of God, are made holy by the grace of God.</body></html>
