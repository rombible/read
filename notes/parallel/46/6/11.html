The words "sanctified" and "justified" as used here do not point to those definite stages in the Christian course to which they generally refer in theological language. The sanctification is here mentioned before the justification, which is not the actual sequence, and it must not therefore be taken as signifying a gradual progress in holiness. What the Apostle urges is, that as they washed themselves in the waters of baptism, so they, by the power of Christ's name and the Holy Spirit, became holy and righteous, thus putting aside, washing off as it were, that impurity and that unrighteousness which once were theirs, and with which they could not enter into the kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And such were some of you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and these things some of you were.</span> As Gentiles, many of them had been "dead in trespasses and sins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>). (For a similar contrast of the change wrought by the Spirit of God, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3-7</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">But ye are washed</span>. The voice and tense in the original differ from those of the following words. This cannot be accidental. It is better, therefore, to render, <span class="accented">But ye washed away your sins</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ye, by your baptism, washed away those stains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>). The very object of Christ's death had been that he might cleanse his Church "by the washing of water by the Word." <span class="cmt_word">But ye are sanctified, but ye are justified;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but ye were sanctified, but y? were justified</span>, namely, at your conversion. By "sanctified" is meant, not the progressive course of sanctification, but the <span class="accented">consecration</span> to God by baptism (Wickliffe, "halowed"). (For what St. Paul meant by justification, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">In the Name of the Lord Jesus,</span> etc. This clause and the next belongs to all the three previous verbs. <span class="cmt_word">Of our God.</span> In the word "our" is involved that appeal to Christian unity of which he never loses sight throughout the letter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-11 The Corinthians are warned against many great evils, of which they had formerly been guilty. There is much force in these inquiries, when we consider that they were addressed to a people puffed up with a fancy of their being above others in wisdom and knowledge. All unrighteousness is sin; all reigning sin, nay, every actual sin, committed with design, and not repented of, shuts out of the kingdom of heaven. Be not deceived. Men are very much inclined to flatter themselves that they may live in sin, yet die in Christ, and go to heaven. But we cannot hope to sow to the flesh, and reap everlasting life. They are reminded what a change the gospel and grace of God had made in them. The blood of Christ, and the washing of regeneration, can take away all guilt. Our justification is owing to the suffering and merit of Christ; our sanctification to the working of the Holy Spirit; but both go together. All who are made righteous in the sight of God, are made holy by the grace of God.</body></html>
