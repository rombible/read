The double act of taking them away from their glorious union with Christ, and joining them to a base body, is implied in the Greek.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Members of Christ.</span> We find the same metaphor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm">Ephesians 5:30</a>. The Church is often alluded to as "the body of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, etc.). Elsewhere the union between Christ and Christians is described by the metaphor of a tree and its branches; a building and the stones of which it is composed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21, 22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">God forbid.</span> An admirable idiom to express the real force of the original, which means, "May it never be!" (for the <span class="accented">rationale</span> of the Greek phrase, I may refer to my 'Brief Greek Syntax,' p. 135). It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4, 6, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-15.htm">Romans 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-14.htm">Romans 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-17.htm">Galatians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21</a>. The formula, which involves the indignant rejection of some false conclusion, is characteristic of the second group of St. Paul's Epistles, but especially (as will be seen) of the Epistle to the Romans. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-20 Some among the Corinthians seem to have been ready to say, All things are lawful for me. This dangerous conceit St. Paul opposes. There is a liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, in which we must stand fast. But surely a Christian would never put himself into the power of any bodily appetite. The body is for the Lord; is to be an instrument of righteousness to holiness, therefore is never to be made an instrument of sin. It is an honour to the body, that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead; and it will be an honour to our bodies, that they will be raised. The hope of a resurrection to glory, should keep Christians from dishonouring their bodies by fleshly lusts. And if the soul be united to Christ by faith, the whole man is become a member of his spiritual body. Other vices may be conquered in fight; that here cautioned against, only by flight. And vast multitudes are cut off by this vice in its various forms and consequences. Its effects fall not only directly upon the body, but often upon the mind. Our bodies have been redeemed from deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by the atoning sacrifice of Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted for our Master's use. Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought with a price of unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself as wholly the Lord's, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business, to the latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with our bodies, and with our spirits which are his.</body></html>
