That price is the blood of Christ, wherewith he purchased the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>). This metaphor of ransom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>) has its full and absolute applicability to man. The effect of Christ's death for us is that we are redeemed from slavery and prison, and the right of our possession is with Christ. Thus by various metaphors the effects of redemption are revealed to us on the human side. When we unduly <span class="accented">press</span> the metaphor, and ask <span class="accented">from whom</span> we were purchased, and <span class="accented">to whom</span> the price was paid, we build up scholastic systems which have only led to error, and respecting which the Church has never sanctioned any exclusive opinion. The thoughts touched upon in this verse are fully developed in the Epistle to the Romans. <span class="cmt_word">Glorify God;</span> by behaving as his redeemed children, and therefore by keeping yourselves pure. In these few brief words St. Paul <span class="accented">sums up</span> all he has said, as he did in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>. In your body. The following words, "and in your spirit, which are God's," are a perfectly correct and harmless gloss, but are not found in the best manuscripts, and are foreign to the drift of the passage. Your body is a temple, and in that temple God must be honoured. (As Augustine says, "Dost thou wish to pray in a temple? pray in thyself. But first <span class="accented">be</span> a temple of God.") "Unchastity dishonours God, and that in his own temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>)" (Meyer). In these clauses St. Paul has touched on three subjects which occupy important sections of the remainder of the Epistle, namely, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the relation between the sexes (ch. 7.); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the question of idol offerings (ch. 8.); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the doctrine of the resurrection (ch. 15.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-20 Some among the Corinthians seem to have been ready to say, All things are lawful for me. This dangerous conceit St. Paul opposes. There is a liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, in which we must stand fast. But surely a Christian would never put himself into the power of any bodily appetite. The body is for the Lord; is to be an instrument of righteousness to holiness, therefore is never to be made an instrument of sin. It is an honour to the body, that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead; and it will be an honour to our bodies, that they will be raised. The hope of a resurrection to glory, should keep Christians from dishonouring their bodies by fleshly lusts. And if the soul be united to Christ by faith, the whole man is become a member of his spiritual body. Other vices may be conquered in fight; that here cautioned against, only by flight. And vast multitudes are cut off by this vice in its various forms and consequences. Its effects fall not only directly upon the body, but often upon the mind. Our bodies have been redeemed from deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by the atoning sacrifice of Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted for our Master's use. Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought with a price of unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself as wholly the Lord's, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business, to the latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with our bodies, and with our spirits which are his.</body></html>
