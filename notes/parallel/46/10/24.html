By "wealth" we now mean temporal possessions or advantage; it originally meant "good," including more especially "moral welfare," as in the collect for the Queen in the Prayer Book, "Grant her in health and wealth long to live."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But every man another's wealth.</span> The addition of the word "wealth" is very infelicitous. Rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">but each his neighbour's good</span> (comp. ver. 33 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-2.htm">Romans 15:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:23-33 There were cases wherein Christians might eat what had been offered to idols, without sin. Such as when the flesh was sold in the market as common food, for the priest to whom it had been given. But a Christian must not merely consider what is lawful, but what is expedient, and to edify others. Christianity by no means forbids the common offices of kindness, or allows uncourteous behaviour to any, however they may differ from us in religious sentiments or practices. But this is not to be understood of religious festivals, partaking in idolatrous worship. According to this advice of the apostle, Christians should take care not to use their liberty to the hurt of others, or to their own reproach. In eating and drinking, and in all we do, we should aim at the glory of God, at pleasing and honouring him. This is the great end of all religion, and directs us where express rules are wanting. A holy, peaceable, and benevolent spirit, will disarm the greatest enemies.</body></html>
