Our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-50.htm" title="This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.">John 6:50</a>) had already made the Christian Church familiar with the "true bread," of which that food had been the typical forecast.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And did all eat the same spiritual meat.</span> As the cloud and the Red Sea symbolized the waters of baptism, so the manna and the water of the rock symbolized the elements of the other Christian sacrament, the Lord's Supper. The manna might be called "a spiritual food," both because it was "angels' food" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>; Wisd. 16:20) and "bread from heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31</a>), and also because it was a type of "God's good Spirit," which he "gave to instruct them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>). St. Paul only knows of <span class="accented">two</span> sacraments. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 To dissuade the Corinthians from communion with idolaters, and security in any sinful course, the apostle sets before them the example of the Jewish nation of old. They were, by a miracle, led through the Red Sea, where the pursuing Egyptians were drowned. It was to them a typical baptism. The manna on which they fed was a type of Christ crucified, the Bread which came down from heaven, which whoso eateth shall live for ever. Christ is the Rock on which the Christian church is built; and of the streams that issue therefrom, all believers drink, and are refreshed. It typified the sacred influences of the Holy Spirit, as given to believers through Christ. But let none presume upon their great privileges, or profession of the truth; these will not secure heavenly happiness.</body></html>
