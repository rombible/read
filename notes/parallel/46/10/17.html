There is one bread, it is broken into many pieces, and as we all (though each receives only a fragment) partake of the one bread which unbroken consisted of these pieces, we though many individuals are one body, even the Body of Christ with whom, as well as with each other, we have communion in that act.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We being many are one bread, and one body.</span> It is easy to see how we are "one <span class="accented">body,"</span> of which Christ is the Head, and we are the members. This is the metaphor used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>. The more difficult expression, "<span class="accented">we</span> <span class="accented">are one bread,"</span> is explained in the next clause. The meaning seems to be - We all partake of the loaf, and thereby become qualitatively, as it were, a part of it, as it of us, even as we all become members of Christ's one body, which that loaf sacramentally represents Some commentators, disliking the harshness of the expression, render it, "Because there is one bread, we being many are one body;" or, "For there is one bread. We being many are one body." But the language and context support the rendering of our version; and the supposed "physiology" is not so modern as to be at all surprising. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-22 Did not the joining in the Lord's supper show a profession of faith in Christ crucified, and of adoring gratitude to him for his salvation ? Christians, by this ordinance, and the faith therein professed, were united as the grains of wheat in one loaf of bread, or as the members in the human body, seeing they were all united to Christ, and had fellowship with him and one another. This is confirmed from the Jewish worship and customs in sacrifice. The apostle applies this to feasting with idolaters. Eating food as part of a heathen sacrifice, was worshipping the idol to whom it was made, and having fellowship or communion with it; just as he who eats the Lord's supper, is accounted to partake in the Christian sacrifice, or as they who ate the Jewish sacrifices partook of what was offered on their altar. It was denying Christianity; for communion with Christ, and communion with devils, could never be had at once. If Christians venture into places, and join in sacrifices to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, they will provoke God.</body></html>
