Moses was God's representative under the Law, and so they were baptised unto him in their voluntarily joining with that "Church" of God which marched beneath the shadow of the cloud, and passed through the waters of the sea--as Christians, are baptised unto Jesus Christ,--He being (in a higher sense both in kind and in degree) God's representative in the New Dispensation.<p>The "cloud" and the "sea" refer to the cloud that overshadowed the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>, and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm" title="And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that you LORD are among this people, that you LORD are seen face to face, and that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.">Numbers 14:14</a>), and the passage through the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-22.htm" title="He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.">Exodus 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-8.htm" title="And the cities which you shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many you shall give many; but from them that have few you shall give few: every one shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inherits.">Numbers 35:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Were all baptized.</span> This reading, though well supported, may, perhaps, be a correction for the middle, "they baptized themselves," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> accepted baptism. The passing under the cloud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>) and through the sea, constituting as it did their deliverance from bondage into freedom, their death to Egypt, and their birth to a new covenant, was a general type or dim shadow of Christian baptism (compare our collect, "figuring thereby thy holy baptism"). But the typology is quite incidental; it is the moral lesson which is paramount. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Moses;</span> rather, <span class="accented">into.</span> By this "baptism" they accepted Moses as their Heaven-seat guide and teacher. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 To dissuade the Corinthians from communion with idolaters, and security in any sinful course, the apostle sets before them the example of the Jewish nation of old. They were, by a miracle, led through the Red Sea, where the pursuing Egyptians were drowned. It was to them a typical baptism. The manna on which they fed was a type of Christ crucified, the Bread which came down from heaven, which whoso eateth shall live for ever. Christ is the Rock on which the Christian church is built; and of the streams that issue therefrom, all believers drink, and are refreshed. It typified the sacred influences of the Holy Spirit, as given to believers through Christ. But let none presume upon their great privileges, or profession of the truth; these will not secure heavenly happiness.</body></html>
