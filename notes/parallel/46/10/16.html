The order in which they are placed here has been variously accounted for, as arising either (Stanley) from the analogy to the heathen feasts, in which the libation came before the food, or (Meyer) because the Apostle intends to dwell at greater length upon the bread. The use of the plural "we," in reference to both the blessing of the cup and the breaking of the bread, clearly indicates that it was in virtue of his representing the entire company present, and not as individually possessed of some miraculous gift, that the one who presided at a Communion performed the act of consecration. On the whole subject of the Eucharistic feasts in Corinth, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.">1Corinthians 11:17</a>. Communion with the body and blood of Christ is established and asserted in this partaking of the bread and of the cup.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The cup of blessing.</span> A translation of the name <span class="accented">cos haberachah</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-13.htm">Psalm 116:13</a>), over which a blessing was invoked by the head of the family after the Passover. The name is here transferred to the chalice in the Eucharist, over which Christ "gave thanks" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27</a>). There seems to be a close connection between the idea of "blessing" (<span class="accented">eulogesas</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-22.htm">Matthew 26:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-22.htm">Mark 14:22</a>) and "giving thanks" (<span class="accented">eucharistesas</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>), and here, as always, St. Paul and St. Luke resemble each other in their expressions. <span class="cmt_word">The communion of;</span> literally, <span class="accented">a participation in.</span> By means of the cup we realize our share in the benefits wrought by Christ's precious blood shedding.

Christians, by this ordinance, and the faith therein professed, were united as the grains of wheat in one loaf of bread, or as the members in the human body, seeing they were all united to Christ, and had fellowship with him and one another. This is confirmed from the Jewish worship and customs in sacrifice. The apostle applies this to feasting with idolaters. Eating food as part of a heathen sacrifice, was worshipping the idol to whom it was made, and having fellowship or communion with it; just as he who eats the Lord's supper, is accounted to partake in the Christian sacrifice, or as they who ate the Jewish sacrifices partook of what was offered on their altar. It was denying Christianity; for communion with Christ, and communion with devils, could never be had at once. If Christians venture into places, and join in sacrifices to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, they will provoke God.</body></html>
