Here your personal liberty is to be modified by the principle mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-24.htm" title="Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.">1Corinthians 10:24</a>. If the weak brother see you eat the flesh which he has just informed you was used as a sacrifice, he may be led by your example to eat it himself, though the very fact of his having called your attention to it showed that he thinks it wrong, and so his conscience is defiled.<p>The word (<span class= "ital">hierothuton</span>) here used (according to the best MSS.) for "offered to an idol" is different from the condemnatory word (<span class= "ital">eidolothuton</span>) elsewhere used; as natural courtesy would lead a Christian at the table of a heathen to use an epithet which would not be offensive to his host. A lesson in controversy--Don't conceal your conscientious convictions, but don't express them in language unnecessarily painful to your opponent.<p>The repetition of the words "The earth is the Lord's," &c., in this verse is an interpolation not found in the best MSS., and tends to interrupt the thought which is carried on in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-29.htm" title="Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?">1Corinthians 10:29</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if any man say unto you.</span> Who is the "any man" is left undefined. Perhaps some "weak" Christian is meant, who happens to be a fellow guest. <span class="cmt_word">This is offered in sacrifice unto idols.</span> The true reading is probably, <span class="accented">hierothuton</span>, sacred sacrifice, not <span class="accented">eidolothuton</span>, idol sacrifice. Perhaps there is a touch of delicate reserve in the word, implying that the remark is made at the table of heathens, who would be insulted by the word <span class="accented">eidolothuton</span>, sacrificed to <span class="accented">idols.</span> Whoever the interlocutor is supposed to be - heathen host or Christian guest - the mere fact of attention being drawn to the food as forming part of a heathen sacrifice is enough to make it your duty to give no overt sanction to idolatry. In that case, therefore, you ought to refuse it. It will be seen how gross was the calumny which asserted that St. Paul taught men to be <span class="accented">indifferent</span> about eating things offered to idols. He only taught indifference in cases where idolatry could not be directly involved in the question. He only repudiates the idle superstition that the food became <span class="accented">inherently tainted</span> by such a consecration when the eater was unaware of it. In later times, when the eating of such offerings was deliberately erected into a test of apostasy, he would have used language as strong against every semblance of compliance as any which was used by St. John himself or by Justin Martyr. Difference of time and circumstances necessarily involves a difference in the mode of viewing matters which in <span class="accented">themselves</span> are unimportant. <span class="cmt_word">For the earth is the Lord's.</span> It is doubtful whether the repetition of this clause is genuine. It is omitted by all the best uncials. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:23-33 There were cases wherein Christians might eat what had been offered to idols, without sin. Such as when the flesh was sold in the market as common food, for the priest to whom it had been given. But a Christian must not merely consider what is lawful, but what is expedient, and to edify others. Christianity by no means forbids the common offices of kindness, or allows uncourteous behaviour to any, however they may differ from us in religious sentiments or practices. But this is not to be understood of religious festivals, partaking in idolatrous worship. According to this advice of the apostle, Christians should take care not to use their liberty to the hurt of others, or to their own reproach. In eating and drinking, and in all we do, we should aim at the glory of God, at pleasing and honouring him. This is the great end of all religion, and directs us where express rules are wanting. A holy, peaceable, and benevolent spirit, will disarm the greatest enemies.</body></html>
