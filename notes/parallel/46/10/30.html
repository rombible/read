To the querulous objector the Apostle gives no definitely limited reply. He lays down in the following verses the great principles which should guide all Christian life, and by which therefore every detail of it should be regulated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if I.</span> The "for" should be omitted. There is no copula in the best manuscripts. <span class="cmt_word">By grace.</span> The word may also mean "with thankfulness" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6</a>. "He that eateth, to the Lord he eateth, <span class="accented">for he giveth God thanks</span>;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>, "Meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving;" compare our phrase," saying <span class="accented">grace"</span>). Another view of these clauses interprets them to mean "You should refrain because, by net doing so, you give occasion to others to judge you" - a rule which has been compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-16.htm">Romans 14:16</a>, "Let not your good be evil spoken of." Whichever view be taken, it is clear that <span class="accented">theoretically</span> St. Paul sided with the views of the "strong," but <span class="accented">sympathetically</span> with those of the "weak." He pleaded for some concession to the scrupulosity of ever morbid consciences, he disapproved of a defiant, ostentatious, insulting liberalism. On the other hand, he discouraged the miserable micrology of a purblind and bigoted superstition, which exaggerated the importance of things external and indifferent. He desiderated more considerateness and self denial on the one side; and on the other, a more robust and instructed faith, he would always tolerate the scruples of the weak, but would not suffer either weakness or strength to develop itself into a vexatious tyranny. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:23-33 There were cases wherein Christians might eat what had been offered to idols, without sin. Such as when the flesh was sold in the market as common food, for the priest to whom it had been given. But a Christian must not merely consider what is lawful, but what is expedient, and to edify others. Christianity by no means forbids the common offices of kindness, or allows uncourteous behaviour to any, however they may differ from us in religious sentiments or practices. But this is not to be understood of religious festivals, partaking in idolatrous worship. According to this advice of the apostle, Christians should take care not to use their liberty to the hurt of others, or to their own reproach. In eating and drinking, and in all we do, we should aim at the glory of God, at pleasing and honouring him. This is the great end of all religion, and directs us where express rules are wanting. A holy, peaceable, and benevolent spirit, will disarm the greatest enemies.</body></html>
