The heathen world is regarded by the Christian Church as under the dominion of the Evil Spirit and his emissaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>), and in reminding the Corinthians that in Israel an eater of the sacrificial meat became a partaker with the altar of God, the Apostle meant to warn them that they would, if they partook of sacrificial meats offered on an altar of devils, become a sharer with that altar and the beings to whom the altar appertained.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. The word rejects the former hypothesis. "[No I do not admit that], but what I say is that," etc. <span class="cmt_word">They sacrifice to devils, and not to God</span>. The word "demons" should be used, not" devils" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>). The argument is that, though the idol is nothing - a mere stock or stone - it is yet the material symbol of a demon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>; Baruch 4:7). So Milton - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"And devils to adore for deities;<br />Then were they known to men by various names,<br />And various idols through the heathen world,...<br />The chief were those who, from the pit of hell,<br />Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix<br />Their seats long after next the seat of God,<br />Their altars by his altar, gods adored<br />Among the nations round."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Paradise Lost,' 1.</span>) St. Paul uses a word which, while it would not be needlessly offensive to Gentiles, conveyed his meaning. The Greeks themselves called their deities <span class="accented">daimonia</span>, and St. Paul adopts the word; but to Jewish ears it meant, not "deities" or "demigods," but "demons." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-22 Did not the joining in the Lord's supper show a profession of faith in Christ crucified, and of adoring gratitude to him for his salvation ? Christians, by this ordinance, and the faith therein professed, were united as the grains of wheat in one loaf of bread, or as the members in the human body, seeing they were all united to Christ, and had fellowship with him and one another. This is confirmed from the Jewish worship and customs in sacrifice. The apostle applies this to feasting with idolaters. Eating food as part of a heathen sacrifice, was worshipping the idol to whom it was made, and having fellowship or communion with it; just as he who eats the Lord's supper, is accounted to partake in the Christian sacrifice, or as they who ate the Jewish sacrifices partook of what was offered on their altar. It was denying Christianity; for communion with Christ, and communion with devils, could never be had at once. If Christians venture into places, and join in sacrifices to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, they will provoke God.</body></html>
