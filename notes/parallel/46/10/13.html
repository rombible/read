From the warning and exhortation of the previous verse the Apostle passes on to words of encouragement, "You need not be hopeless or despairing." God permits the temptation by allowing the circumstances which create temptation to arise, but He takes care that no Fate bars the path of retreat. With each temptation he makes a way to escape from it. And that is so, must be so, because God is faithful. The state of salvation to which God has called us would be a delusion if there were an insuperable difficulty to our continuing in it. We have in this verse, perhaps, the most practical and therefore the clearest exposition to be found of the doctrine of free-will in relation to God's overruling power. God makes an open road, but then man himself must <span class= "ital">walk</span> in it. God controls circumstances, but man uses them. That is where <span class= "ital">his</span> responsibility lies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But such as is common to man;</span> rather, <span class="accented">except such as is human</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> such as man can bear. The last verse was a warning; this is an encouragement. Having just heard what efforts even St. Paul had to make to run in the Christian race, and how terribly their fathers in the wilderness had failed to meet the requirements of God, they might be inclined to throw up every effort in despair. St. Paul, therefore, reminds them that these temptations were not superhuman, but were such as men <span class="accented">had</span> resisted, and such as <span class="accented">they</span> could resist. God is faithful He had called them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>), and since he knew "how to deliver the godly out of temptations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>), he would surely perform his side of the covenant, and, if they did their parts, would stablish and keep them from evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>). Also. The mode of deliverance shall be ready simultaneously with the temptation. Away to escape; rather, <span class="accented">the way to escape.</span> The way to escape is different in different temptations, but for each temptation God would provide the <span class="accented">special</span> means of escaping it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 Carnal desires gain strength by indulgence, therefore should be checked in their first rise. Let us fear the sins of Israel, if we would shun their plagues. And it is but just to fear, that such as tempt Christ, will be left by him in the power of the old serpent. Murmuring against God's disposals and commands, greatly provokes him. Nothing in Scripture is written in vain; and it is our wisdom and duty to learn from it. Others have fallen, and so may we. The Christian's security against sin is distrust of himself. God has not promised to keep us from falling, if we do not look to ourselves. To this word of caution, a word of comfort is added. Others have the like burdens, and the like temptations: what they bear up under, and break through, we may also. God is wise as well as faithful, and will make our burdens according to our strength. He knows what we can bear. He will make a way to escape; he will deliver either from the trial itself, or at least the mischief of it. We have full encouragement to flee from sin, and to be faithful to God. We cannot fall by temptation, if we cleave fast to him. Whether the world smiles or frowns, it is an enemy; but believers shall be strengthened to overcome it, with all its terrors and enticements. The fear of the Lord, put into their hearts, will be the great means of safety.</body></html>
