The emphatic repetition of the word "spiritual" before "drink" and "rock" reminds the reader that it is the spiritual and not the historic aspect of the fact which is present to St. Paul's mind. The traditional account of the Rock was a more complete illustration of the abiding presence of God, which was the point that the Apostle here desires to bring forward.<p><span class= "bld">And that Rock was Christ.</span>--As Christ was "God manifest in the flesh" in the New Dispensation, so God manifest in the Rock (the source of sustaining life) was the Christ of the Old Dispensation. The Jews had become familiar with the thought of God as a Rock. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-2.htm" title="There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.">1Samuel 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-12.htm" title="They shall bear you up in their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone.">Psalm 91:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm" title="And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.">Isaiah 32:2</a>.) Though the Jews may have recognised the Rock poetically as God, they knew not that it was, as a manifestation of God's presence, typical of <span class= "ital">the</span> manifestation which was yet to be given in the Incarnation. Such seems to be the force of the statement and of the word "But" which emphatically introduces it. <span class= "ital">But</span> though they thought it only a Rock, or applied the word poetically to Jehovah, that Rock <span class= "ital">was</span> Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same spiritual drink.</span> The water from the smitten rock might (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>) be called a "spiritual" drink, both as being a miraculous gift (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-29.htm">Galatians 4:29</a>, where Isaac is said to be "born <span class="accented">after the spirit"</span>), and as being a type of that "living water" which "springs up into everlasting life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>), and of the blood of Christ in the Eucharist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-55.htm">John 6:55</a>). These "waters in the wilderness" and "rivers in the desert" were a natural symbol of the grace of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>), especially as bestowed in the sacrament through material signs. <span class="cmt_word">They drank;</span> literally, <span class="accented">they were drinking</span>, implying a <span class="accented">continuous</span> gift. <span class="cmt_word">Of that spiritual Rock that followed them;</span> rather, literally, <span class="accented">of a spiritual following Rock.</span> This is explained <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a mere figure of speech, in which the natural rock which Moses smote is left out of sight altogether; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as meaning that not the rock, but the water from the rock, followed after them in their wanderings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>). There can, however, be little or no doubt that St. Paul refers to the common Jewish Hagadah, that the actual material rock did follow the Israelites in their wanderings. The rabbis said that it was round, and rolled itself up like a swarm of bees, and that, when the tabernacle was pitched, this rock came and settled in its vestibule, and began to flow when the princes came to it and sang, "Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-17.htm">Numbers 21:17</a>). It does not, of course, follow from this allusion that St. Paul, or even the rabbis, believed their Hagadah <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">other than a metaphorical sense.</span> The Jewish Hagadoth - legends and illustrations and inferences of an imaginative Oriental people - are not to be taken <span class="accented">au pied de la lettre.</span> St. Paul obviates the laying of any stress on the mere legend by the qualifying word, "a <span class="accented">spiritual</span> Rock." <span class="cmt_word">And that Rock was Christ.</span> The writings of Philo, and the Alexandrian school of thought in general, had familiarized all Jewish readers with language of this kind. They were accustomed to see types of God, or of the Word (<span class="accented">Logos</span>), in almost every incident of the deliverance from Egypt and the wanderings in the wilderness. Thus in Wisd. 10:15 and Wisdom 11:4 it is Wisdom - another form of the <span class="accented">Logos</span> - who leads and supports the Israelites. The frequent comparison, of God to a Rock in the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-2.htm">1 Samuel 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a>, etc.) would render the symbolism more easy, especially as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a> we find, "Behold, I [Jehovah] will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 To dissuade the Corinthians from communion with idolaters, and security in any sinful course, the apostle sets before them the example of the Jewish nation of old. They were, by a miracle, led through the Red Sea, where the pursuing Egyptians were drowned. It was to them a typical baptism. The manna on which they fed was a type of Christ crucified, the Bread which came down from heaven, which whoso eateth shall live for ever. Christ is the Rock on which the Christian church is built; and of the streams that issue therefrom, all believers drink, and are refreshed. It typified the sacred influences of the Holy Spirit, as given to believers through Christ. But let none presume upon their great privileges, or profession of the truth; these will not secure heavenly happiness.</body></html>
