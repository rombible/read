Having warned them against any participation in idolatry, even such as would be involved in joining in the sacrificial feasts, as dangerous to themselves, he now proceeds to show that such a participation would be derogatory to, and incompatible with, their union with Christ. The identity and intimacy of that union is first established by a reference to the Holy Communion, in partaking of which both the unity of the Church and its union with Christ are vividly expressed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-22.</span> - <span class="accented">The inherent disgracefulness of any tampering with idolatry.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</span> An appeal to their own reason to confirm his argument (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-13.htm">1 Corinthians 11:13</a>), perhaps with a touch of irony in the first clause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-10.htm">1 Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-19.htm">2 Corinthians 11:19</a>). The word for "I say" is <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, I affirm. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:15-22 Did not the joining in the Lord's supper show a profession of faith in Christ crucified, and of adoring gratitude to him for his salvation ? Christians, by this ordinance, and the faith therein professed, were united as the grains of wheat in one loaf of bread, or as the members in the human body, seeing they were all united to Christ, and had fellowship with him and one another. This is confirmed from the Jewish worship and customs in sacrifice. The apostle applies this to feasting with idolaters. Eating food as part of a heathen sacrifice, was worshipping the idol to whom it was made, and having fellowship or communion with it; just as he who eats the Lord's supper, is accounted to partake in the Christian sacrifice, or as they who ate the Jewish sacrifices partook of what was offered on their altar. It was denying Christianity; for communion with Christ, and communion with devils, could never be had at once. If Christians venture into places, and join in sacrifices to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, they will provoke God.</body></html>
