The same kind of dangers still beset God's people, but they will never be greater than the strength which God will give to bear them. These thoughts are then applied to the immediate subject in hand, viz., the partaking of meat which had been used in the heathen temples. The subject is, as it were, taken up from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.">1Corinthians 8:13</a>, where an expression of personal willingness to forego a right, led the writer aside to the subject which occupies 1 Corinthians 9. Uniting <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1Corinthians 11:1</a>, with the last verse of this chapter, the general outline of the argument is as follows:--<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;">1Corinthians 10:1-11</a>. The history of the Jewish Church contains examples which ought to be warnings against self-confidence.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="Why let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.">1Corinthians 10:12-14</a>. These thoughts should make the Christians distrustful of themselves, but not hopeless.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.">1Corinthians 10:15-17</a>. The unity of the Christian body with Christ, as expressed and realised in the Holy Communion, renders impossible a communion of the same body with the objects of idolatrous worship.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-18.htm" title="Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?">1Corinthians 10:18-22</a>. Any partaking of idolatrous feasts would involve union to such extent as would compromise, just as Israel's partaking of sacrifical offerings involved union with the altar of Jehovah.<p>1Co 10:23 -1Co_11:1. An enunciation of the principles deduced from the foregoing considerations which should guide the Corinthian Christians in their partaking of meat which might have been offered to idols.<p><span class= "bld">That ye should be ignorant.</span>--The thought here is not that his readers were at all likely to be ignorant of the mere historical fact which he now recalls, and with which they were doubtless quite familiar, but that they were probably unmindful of the spiritual lessons which are to be learnt from such a grouping of the facts as the Apostle now gives, and of the striking contrast between the enjoyment of great privileges by <span class= "ital">all</span> (five times emphatically repeated) and the apostacy of the greater part of them. The Apostle assumes their familiarity with the facts referred to, and does not feel it needful to mention that of the "all," literally only two (Joshua and Caleb) gained the ultimate approval of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">Our fathers.</span>--These words need not limit the reference of this teaching to the Jewish Christians only. It would include all Christians by right of spiritual descent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - <span class="accented">Warnings against over confidence in relation to idolatry and other temptations.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for.</span> He has just shown them, by his own example, the necessity for strenuous watchfulness and effort. In continuance of the same lesson, he teaches them historically that the possession of great privileges is no safeguard, and that the seductions, even of idolatry, must not be carelessly despised. Although the connection of the various paragraphs is not stated with logical precision, we see that they all bear on the one truth which he wants to inculcate, namely, that it is both wise and kind to limit our personal freedom out of sympathy with others. The reading "but" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, morever) is probably a correction of the true reading (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, for), due to the failure to understand the whole train of thought. <span class="cmt_word">I would not that ye should be ignorant.</span> This is a favourite phrase of St. Paul's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>). The ignorance to which he refers is not ignorance of the facts, but of the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the facts. <span class="cmt_word">All our fathers.</span> He repeats the "all" five times, because he wishes to show that, though "all" partook of spiritual blessings, most (ver. 5) fell in spite of them. He says, "our fathers," not only because he was himself a Jew, but also because the patriarchs and the Israelites were spiritually the fathers of the Christian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Were under the cloud.</span> The compressed Greek phrase implies that they <span class="accented">went</span> under it, and remained under its shadow. The "cloud" is the "pillar of cloud" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), of which David says, "He spread a cloud <span class="accented">for a covering"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>). The Book of Wisdom (10:17) calls it "a cover unto them by day," and (19:7) "a cloud shadowing the camp." <span class="cmt_word">All passed through the sea</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-22.htm">Exodus 14:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 To dissuade the Corinthians from communion with idolaters, and security in any sinful course, the apostle sets before them the example of the Jewish nation of old. They were, by a miracle, led through the Red Sea, where the pursuing Egyptians were drowned. It was to them a typical baptism. The manna on which they fed was a type of Christ crucified, the Bread which came down from heaven, which whoso eateth shall live for ever. Christ is the Rock on which the Christian church is built; and of the streams that issue therefrom, all believers drink, and are refreshed. It typified the sacred influences of the Holy Spirit, as given to believers through Christ. But let none presume upon their great privileges, or profession of the truth; these will not secure heavenly happiness.</body></html>
