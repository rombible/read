The rabbis said, "Whatever happened to the fathers is a sign to their children." The thought is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>, "Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning." The example in this instance would come home more forcibly from the sickness and mortality then prevalent among the Corinthian Christians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ends of the world;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of the egos.</span> The expression is in accordance with the view which regarded the then epoch as "the close or consummation of the ages" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>, "The end of all things is at hand;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>, "It is the last time;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 Carnal desires gain strength by indulgence, therefore should be checked in their first rise. Let us fear the sins of Israel, if we would shun their plagues. And it is but just to fear, that such as tempt Christ, will be left by him in the power of the old serpent. Murmuring against God's disposals and commands, greatly provokes him. Nothing in Scripture is written in vain; and it is our wisdom and duty to learn from it. Others have fallen, and so may we. The Christian's security against sin is distrust of himself. God has not promised to keep us from falling, if we do not look to ourselves. To this word of caution, a word of comfort is added. Others have the like burdens, and the like temptations: what they bear up under, and break through, we may also. God is wise as well as faithful, and will make our burdens according to our strength. He knows what we can bear. He will make a way to escape; he will deliver either from the trial itself, or at least the mischief of it. We have full encouragement to flee from sin, and to be faithful to God. We cannot fall by temptation, if we cleave fast to him. Whether the world smiles or frowns, it is an enemy; but believers shall be strengthened to overcome it, with all its terrors and enticements. The fear of the Lord, put into their hearts, will be the great means of safety.</body></html>
