All creation is <span class= "ital">of</span> the Father through the Son. All creation is for the Father and likewise <span class= "ital">for</span> the Son. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>.) The words "we by Him" must not be regarded as a repetition of part of the thought of the previous sentence; but as the words "by whom are all things" express the fact of physical creation, so the words, "we by Him," attribute our spiritual re-creation as Christians to the same source. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.">Ephesians 2:10</a>.) This sixth verse then sweeps away completely any pantheistic conception which might have been thought to be in the previous words. Even granting, for argument sake, that such gods or lords do exist, we have but one God, one Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But to us.</span> The "but" means "nevertheless." We Christians only regard these "gods," "lords," and "idols" as nonexistent, except so far as they correspond to created and material things. <span class="cmt_word">The Father.</span> Not only by creation and preservation, but much more by redemption and adoption, and as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of whom are all things.</span> All things, even including the gods of the heathen, "visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all firings were created by him and for him,... and by him all things consist" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And we in him;</span> rather, <span class="accented">into</span> or <span class="accented">for him.</span> He is the End and Goal as well as the Author of our existence. <span class="cmt_word">One Lord.</span> The only real "Lord," though the Roman emperors often took the title, and one of them - Domitian - insisted on the use of the expression, <span class="accented">"Dominus Deusque noster"</span> ("Our Lord and God"), as applied to himself (Suetonius. 'Domit.,' 13). <span class="cmt_word">By whom are all things.</span> "By whom," as the Agent of creation and redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And we by him.</span> "By him,"as the Mediator and the Giver of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>, "Of him, and to him, and through him are all things"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 There is no proof of ignorance more common than conceit of knowledge. Much may be known, when nothing is known to good purpose. And those who think they know any thing, and grow vain thereon, are the least likely to make good use of their knowledge. Satan hurts some as much by tempting them to be proud of mental powers, as others, by alluring to sensuality. Knowledge which puffs up the possessor, and renders him confident, is as dangerous as self-righteous pride, though what he knows may be right. Without holy affections all human knowledge is worthless. The heathens had gods of higher and lower degree; gods many, and lords many; so called, but not such in truth. Christians know better. One God made all, and has power over all. The one God, even the Father, signifies the Godhead as the sole object of all religious worship; and the Lord Jesus Christ denotes the person of Emmanuel, God manifest in the flesh, One with the Father, and with us; the appointed Mediator, and Lord of all; through whom we come to the Father, and through whom the Father sends all blessings to us, by the influence and working of the Holy Spirit. While we refuse all worship to the many who are called gods and lords, and to saints and angels, let us try whether we really come to God by faith in Christ.</body></html>
