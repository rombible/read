In Corinth and other cities meat was offered for sale which had been used for sacrificial purposes in the heathen temples, having been sold to the dealers by the priests, who received a large share of the sacrifices for themselves, or by the individuals who offered them, and had more remaining of their own share than they could use themselves. Thus, a Christian might unconsciously eat of meat, either at the house of a friend (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-27.htm" title="If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and you be disposed to go; whatever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.">1Corinthians 10:27</a>) or by purchasing it himself in the public shambles, which had been previously brought in contact by sacrificial usage with an idol. There were some in Corinth who felt no scruple on the subject. An idol was nothing in their opinion. It could neither consecrate nor pollute that which was offered in its temple. Such Christians would, to show how completely and effectively their Christianity had dispelled all their previous heathen superstition, buy meat without caring whence it came, partake of a heathen friend's hospitality, regardless of what use the meat had been put to, and even join in a repast held in the outer court of a heathen temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;">1Corinthians 8:10</a>), where the meat would almost certainly be what had been saved after the sacrifice. That St. Paul would have done so himself, so far as his own personal feelings alone were concerned, we can scarcely doubt. To him, therefore, those who acted upon his authority appealed upon this subject.<p>There were others at Corinth, however, who felt some scruples upon the subject. There were heathen converts who had not completely got rid of every vestige of the old superstition, or whose conscience would accuse them of not having wholly given up idolatry if they took any part even in its social aspect: for many social acts, as well as purely religious ceremonies, were in the heathen mind included in acts of worship. And there were Jews, the intensity of whose traditional hatred of idolatry could not allow them to regard as "nothing" that against which Jehovah had uttered His most terrible denunciations, and against which He had preserved their race as a living witness.<p>To both these sections of the Church the conduct of the more liberal party would prove a serious stumbling-block. The argument used by those who asked St. Paul's advice was evidently that the Christians have knowledge enough to feel that an idol is nothing, and that, therefore. there can be no harm in partaking of what has been offered to "nothing." "We know," says St. Paul, in reply, taking up the words of their own letter, "we know that we all have knowledge: we know that an idol is nothing."

Knowledge puffs up the man himself. Love builds up the whole Church. The word "edify" has now only a moral significance. Originally it could be applied to moral conduct only figuratively. The substantive "edifice" has retained its original literal meaning. In Spenser "edify" is used in its literal sense; and in Hakluyt's <span class= "ital">Travels</span> (1553) the "edification" of the castle of Corfu is mentioned. The use made by St. Paul of this figure is of some importance. The word is used only by St. Paul, and once by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-31.htm" title="Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.">Acts 9:31</a>), and the idea which it conveys is not so much the improvement of the individual as the building-up of the whole Christian edifice. We have come to speak of an "edifying discourse" if it helps the individual. St. Paul would have spoken of an "edifying work" if it built up the Church. "We are sometimes too apt to treat Christianity as if it were <span class= "ital">monolithic"</span> (Howson). (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-19.htm" title="And if they were all one member, where were the body?">1Corinthians 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm" title="But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.">1Corinthians 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-5.htm" title="I would that you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied: for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.">1Corinthians 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1Corinthians 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-17.htm" title="For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not edified.">1Corinthians 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm" title="Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.">1Thessalonians 5:11</a>.) It is worth noting that the word used in the original in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.">Hebrews 3:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>, is quite different from the word employed, here and elsewhere, by St. Paul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The relation of lore to knowledge with respect to the question of eating idol offerings.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As touching things offered unto idols</span>. This was doubtless one of the questions on which the Corinthians had asked for advice. We judge from the tone of the questions to which St. Paul here replies that the majority of the Corinthians, being liberal in their views, held that it was a matter of perfect indifference to eat idol offerings; and that, in acting upon this conviction, they contemptuously overrode the convictions of those who could not help thinking that when they did so they committed a sin. The practical decision of the question was one of immense importance. If it were unlawful under any circumstances to eat idol offerings, then the Gentile convert was condemned to a life of Levitism almost as rigorous as that of the Jew. The distinction between clean and unclean meats formed an insuperable barrier between Jews and Gentiles. Wherever they lived, Jews required a butcher of their own, who had been trained in the rules and ceremonies which enabled him to decide and to ensure that all the meat which they ate should be clean (<span class="accented">tahor</span>), not unclean (<span class="accented">tame</span>). They could touch no meat which was not certified as free from legal blemish or ceremonial pollution by the affixed leaden seal on which was engraved the word "lawful" (<span class="accented">kashar</span>). But Gentiles had always been accustomed to buy meat in the markets. Now, much of this meat consisted of remnants of animals slain as sacrifices, after the priests had had their share. So completely was this case, that the word "to sacrifice" had come to mean "to kill" in Hellenistic Greek. Theophrastus, in his 'Moral Sketches,' defines the close-handed man as one who, at his daughter's wedding feast, sells all the victims offered except the sacred parts; and the shameless person as one who, after offering a sacrifice, salts the victim for future use, and goes out to dine with someone else. The market was therefore stocked with meat which had been connected with idol sacrifices. The Christian could never be sure about any meat which he bought if he held it wrong to partake of these offerings. Further than this, he would - especially if he were poor - feel it a great privation to be entirely cut off from the public feasts (<span class="accented">sussitia</span>), which perhaps were often his only chance of eating meat at all; and also to be forbidden to take a social meal with any of his Gentile neighbours or relatives. The question was therefore a "burning" one. It involved much of the comfort and brightness of ancient social life (Thucydides, 2:38; Aristotle, 'Eth.,' 7:9, &sect; 5; Cicero, 'Off.,' 2:16; Livy, 8:32, etc.). It will be seen that St. Paul treats it with consummate wisdom and tenderness. His liberality of thought shows itself in this - that he sides with those who took the strong, the broad, the common sense view, that sin is not a mechanical matter, and that sin is not committed where no sin is intended. He neither adopts the ascetic view nor does he taunt the inquirers with the fact that the whole weight of their personal desires and interests would lead them to decide the question in their own favour. On the other hand, he has too deep a sympathy with the weak to permit their scruples to be overruled with a violence which would wound their consciences. While he accepts the right principle of Christian freedom, he carefully guards against its abuse. It might have been supposed that, as a Jew, and one who had been trained as a "Pharisee of Pharisees," St. Paul would have sided with those who forbade any participation in idol offerings. Jewish rabbis referred to passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-2.htm">Numbers 25:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>; Tobit 1:10, 11. Rabbi Ishmael, in 'Avoda Zara,' said that a Jew might not even go to a Gentile funeral, even if he took with him his own meat and his own servants. The law of the drink offering forbids a Jew to drink of a cask if anyone has even touched a goblet drawn from it with the presumed intention of offering little to the gods. Besides this, the Synod of Jerusalem had mentioned the eating of idol offerings as one of the four things which they forbade to Gentile converts, who were only bound by the Noachian precepts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>). But St. Paul judged the matter independently by his own apostolic authority. The decision of the synod had only had a local validity trod was inapplicable to such a community as that of Corinth. St. Paul had to suffer cruel <span class="accented">misrepresentation</span> and bitter persecution as the consequence of this breadth of view (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21-24</a>); but that would not be likely to make him shrink from saying the truth. This treatment of the subject closely resembles that which he subsequently adopted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">We know that we all have knowledge</span>. It is very probable that this is a semi-ironical quotation of the somewhat conceited remark which had occurred in the letter from Corinth. No doubt there was a sense in which it might (theoretically) be regarded as true; but it was St. Paul's duty both to disparage this kind of knowledge and to show that, after all, there were some among them who did <span class="accented">not</span> possess it (ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">Knowledge puffeth up.</span> The brief energetic clause, "Knowledge puffeth up; love buildeth up," shows the strong feeling with which the apostle enters on the discussion. There is a wide distance between theoretic knowledge and heavenly wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13-18</a>). "He who is full is rich; he who is puffed up is empty" (Stanley). "The first person puffed up was the devil" (Beza). Charity edifieth. There is no reason whatever for the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;</span> sometimes by "love," sometimes by "charity." The fondness for variation which led King James's translators to do so only obscures the identity of thought which prevails among all the apostles respecting the absolute primacy of love as the chief sphere and test of the Christian life. <span class="accented">Edifieth.</span> Helps to build us up as stones in the spiritual temple (ch. 3:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>). "If because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 There is no proof of ignorance more common than conceit of knowledge. Much may be known, when nothing is known to good purpose. And those who think they know any thing, and grow vain thereon, are the least likely to make good use of their knowledge. Satan hurts some as much by tempting them to be proud of mental powers, as others, by alluring to sensuality. Knowledge which puffs up the possessor, and renders him confident, is as dangerous as self-righteous pride, though what he knows may be right. Without holy affections all human knowledge is worthless. The heathens had gods of higher and lower degree; gods many, and lords many; so called, but not such in truth. Christians know better. One God made all, and has power over all. The one God, even the Father, signifies the Godhead as the sole object of all religious worship; and the Lord Jesus Christ denotes the person of Emmanuel, God manifest in the flesh, One with the Father, and with us; the appointed Mediator, and Lord of all; through whom we come to the Father, and through whom the Father sends all blessings to us, by the influence and working of the Holy Spirit. While we refuse all worship to the many who are called gods and lords, and to saints and angels, let us try whether we really come to God by faith in Christ.</body></html>
