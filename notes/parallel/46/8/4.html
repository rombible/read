Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>. The subject resumed after the parenthesis. We have, perhaps, in this repetition of the words a characteristic of a letter written by another from the author's dictation, as was the case with this and other epistles.<p><span class= "bld">An idol is nothing in the world.</span>--It is nothing in itself but a piece of wood or metal, and it really represents nothing, for we know that there is "no God but one." The word "other" was inserted in later MSS., probably from a recollection of the words of the first commandment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We know that an idol is nothing in the world.</span> After his brief but pregnant digression on the nature of <span class="accented">true</span> knowledge, he returns to these questions, and probably once more quotes their own words. They had given this reason for open and public indifference with respect to meat offered to idols. With respect to idols, three views were possible to Christians: either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that they were "demons" - the spirits of deified dead men; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that they were evil spirits - a favorite view among the Jews (via 10:20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-15.htm">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that they were merely (lead images corresponding to nothing <span class="cmt_word">at</span> all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44.htm">Isaiah 44</a> etc.). <span class="cmt_word">That</span> there is <span class="cmt_word">none other God but one.</span> This belief is the signature of Judaism, according to their daily and oft repeated <span class="accented">shema</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 There is no proof of ignorance more common than conceit of knowledge. Much may be known, when nothing is known to good purpose. And those who think they know any thing, and grow vain thereon, are the least likely to make good use of their knowledge. Satan hurts some as much by tempting them to be proud of mental powers, as others, by alluring to sensuality. Knowledge which puffs up the possessor, and renders him confident, is as dangerous as self-righteous pride, though what he knows may be right. Without holy affections all human knowledge is worthless. The heathens had gods of higher and lower degree; gods many, and lords many; so called, but not such in truth. Christians know better. One God made all, and has power over all. The one God, even the Father, signifies the Godhead as the sole object of all religious worship; and the Lord Jesus Christ denotes the person of Emmanuel, God manifest in the flesh, One with the Father, and with us; the appointed Mediator, and Lord of all; through whom we come to the Father, and through whom the Father sends all blessings to us, by the influence and working of the Holy Spirit. While we refuse all worship to the many who are called gods and lords, and to saints and angels, let us try whether we really come to God by faith in Christ.</body></html>
