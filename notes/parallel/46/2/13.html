So here, the spiritual things are "compared" with the spiritual language in which they are stated. Another meaning--<span class= "ital">explaining spiritual things to spiritual men</span>--has been suggested, but that adopted would seem to be the more simple and natural. This second interpretation, would make these words the introduction to the remark which follows about "the spiritual man," but it involves a use of the word in which it is not found elsewhere in the New Testament.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span> The meaning of this clause is very uncertain.

"Interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men" (Bengel, Reichert, Stanley, margin of Revised Version; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>, LXX.). "Explaining spiritual things in spiritual words." This meaning the Greek will not bear, but Calvin and Beza get the same meaning by rendering it, "Adapting spiritual things to spiritual words." It is doubtful whether the Greek verb (<span class="accented">sunkrinontes</span>) can be rendered "comparing," which comes from the Vulgate, <span class="accented">comparantes.</span> Wickliffe has the version, "Maken a liknesse of spyritual things to goostli men, for a besteli man persuyved not through thingis." The commonest sense of the word in the LXX. is "interpreting" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>, etc.), and the best rendering is, "Explaining spirituals to spiritual men." If it be supposed that the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> acquired the sense of "comparing" in Hellenistic Greek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>; Wisd. 7:29 Wisd. 15:18), then the rendering of our Authorized Version may stand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 God has revealed true wisdom to us by his Spirit. Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.</body></html>
