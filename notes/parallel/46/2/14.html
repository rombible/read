True psychology regards man as a trinity of natures. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>.) In accordance with this, St. Paul speaks of man as consisting of body (<span class= "ital">soma</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> soul (<span class= "ital">psyche</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and spirit (<span class= "ital">pneuma</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> the <span class= "ital">soma</span> is our physical nature; the <span class= "ital">psyche</span> is our intellectual nature, embracing also our desires and human affections; the <span class= "ital">pneuma</span> is our spiritual nature. Thus in each of us there is a somatical man, a psychical man, and a pneumatical man; and according as any one of those parts of the nature dominates over the other, so is the character of the individual person. One in whom the <span class= "ital">soma</span> is strongest is a "carnal," or "fleshly," man; one in whom the intellect or affections pre-dominate is a "natural," or "psychic," man; and one in whom the spirit rules (which it can do only when enlightened and guided by the Spirit of God, which acts on it) is a "spiritual" man. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Natural.</span>--That is, literally, that part of our nature which we call "mind," and hence signifies that man in whom pure intellectual reason and the merely natural affections predominate. Now such a one cannot grasp spiritual truth any more than the physical nature, which is made to discern physical things, can grasp intellectual things. Spiritual truth appeals to the spirit of the man, and therefore is intelligible only to those who are "spiritual," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in whom the <span class= "ital">pneuma</span> is not dormant, but quickened by the Holy <span class= "ital">Pneuma.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The natural man.</span> The Greek word is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (psychical); literally, <span class="accented">soulish, i.e.</span> the man who lives the mere life of his lower understanding, the unspiritual, sensuous, and egoistic man. He may be superior to the fleshly, sensual, or carnal man, who lives only the life of the body (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>); but is far below the spiritual man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>) recognizes the tripartite nature of man - body, soul, spirit. <span class="cmt_word">Receiveth not</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "does not choose to accept." He judges them by the foregone conclusions of his own prejudice. <span class="cmt_word">Because they are spiritually judged.</span> The organ for the recognition of such truths - namely, the spirit - has become paralyzed or fallen into atrophy, from neglect; therefore the egoist and the sensualist have lost the faculty whereby alone spiritual truth is discernible. It becomes to them what painting is to the blind, or music to the deaf. This elementary truth is again and again insisted on in Scripture, and ignored by sceptics (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44, 45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3-6</a>). This verse is sometimes used to depreciate knowledge, reason, and intellect. On that abuse of the passage, see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3. 8:4-11, an admirable passage, which Bishop Wordsworth quotes at length. It is, perhaps, sufficient to say that if God has no need of human knowledge, he has still less need of human ignorance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 God has revealed true wisdom to us by his Spirit. Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.</body></html>
