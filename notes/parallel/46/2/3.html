The "weakness and fear and trembling" of which St. Paul speaks here had in it probably a large element of that self-distrust which so noble and sensitive a nature would feel in the fulfilment of such an exalted mission as the preaching of the Cross. I cannot think, however, the allusion is only to that. There is, I believe, a reference also to what we may call a physical apprehension of danger. The bravest are not those who do not experience any sensation of fear, but rather those who keenly appreciate danger, who have an instinctive shrinking from it, and yet eventually by their moral might conquer this dread. There are traces of this element in St. Paul's character to be found in several places, as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>, when the Lord encourages him when labouring at Corinth with the hopeful words, "Be not afraid;" again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-11.htm" title="And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.">Acts 23:11</a>, when the terrible scene before Ananias had depressed him, the Lord is with him to strengthen him, "Be of good cheer, Paul;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-24.htm" title="Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, see, God has given you all them that sail with you.">Acts 27:24</a>, when the angel of the Lord appears to him amid the storm and shipwreck, "Fear not, Paul."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was with you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I became</span> or <span class="accented">proved myself, towards you</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In weakness</span>. St. Paul was physically weak and liable also to nervous weakness and depression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7, 10</a>). He shows an occasional self distrust rising from the consciousness of personal infirmities. This enhances our sense of his heroic courage and endurance. Doubtless this physical weakness and nervous depression were connected with his "stake in the flesh," which seems to have been an acute and distressing form of ophthalmia, accompanied with cerebral disturbance (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:215-221). <span class="cmt_word">In fear, and in much trembling.</span> Probably the words are even literally true, though they are a common phrase (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-15.htm">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>). It must be remembered that in his first visit to Corinth St. Paul had gone through stormy and troubled days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1-12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 Christ, in his person, and offices, and sufferings, is the sum and substance of the gospel, and ought to be the great subject of a gospel minister's preaching, but not so as to leave out other parts of God's revealed truth and will. Paul preached the whole counsel of God. Few know the fear and trembling of faithful ministers, from a deep sense of their own weakness They know how insufficient they are, and are fearful for themselves. When nothing but Christ crucified is plainly preached, the success must be entirely from Divine power accompanying the word, and thus men are brought to believe, to the salvation of their souls.</body></html>
