The assertion is in the Greek a more striking contrast to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1Corinthians 2:4</a> than appears in the English. In the original (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1Corinthians 2:4</a>) the word is "wisdom," and not "<span class= "ital">man's</span> wisdom," as in the English. Thus the statement here is a verbal contradiction of that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1Corinthians 2:4</a>. In using the plural "we," St. Paul implies that he did not stand alone among the Apostles in the method of his teaching.<p><span class= "bld">Them that are perfect</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> those who are grown up, and not "babes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1Corinthians 3:1</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm" title="Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.">1Corinthians 14:20</a>). The "wisdom" of the gospel is that deep spiritual truth which only those whose spiritual natures have been trained and cultivated were capable of understanding. This "wisdom," however, the Apostle had not taught the Corinthians; he had only taught them the alphabet of Christianity, for they were still but "babes"--they were still only "fleshly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?">1Corinthians 3:3</a>). That the Apostle himself not only grasped the higher truths which he designates the "wisdom" of the gospel, but taught them gladly when there were hearers capable of appreciating them, is evident from many passages in the Epistles to the Romans, Colossians, and Ephesians, where he unfolds the "mysteries" of the gospel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Yet not.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a wisdom, however, not of this world.</span><p><span class= "bld">That come to nought.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">which are being brought to nought,</span> the reference here being, not to the inherent transitoriness of human wisdom and teachers, but to the fact that they are being brought to nought by God's rejection of them, and His choice of the "weak" things as the means of spreading the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-28.htm" title="And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are:">1Corinthians 1:28</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-16.</span> - The <span class="accented">apparent foolishness is the only wisdom.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit.</span> In this passage he shows that in reality a crushing irony lay in his description of the gospel as being, in the world's judgment, "weak" and "foolish." It was the highest wisdom, but it could only be understood by the perfect.

Ignatius (?) seems to have understood it thus; for he adopted the strange notion that "the prince of this aeon" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Satan) had been deceived and frustrated by the incarnation from a virgin, and the death on the cross (Ignat., 'Ad. Ephesians,' 19). It means more probably "wisdom," as understood by Roman governors and Jewish Sanhedrists, who treated the Divine wisdom of the gospel with sovereign contempt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That [who] come to nought</span>; literally, <span class="accented">who are being done away with.</span> Amid all the feebleness of the infant Church, St. Paul saw empires vanishing before it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-9 Those who receive the doctrine of Christ as Divine, and, having been enlightened by the Holy Spirit, have looked well into it, see not only the plain history of Christ, and him crucified, but the deep and admirable designs of Divine wisdom therein. It is the mystery made manifest to the saints, Col 1:26, though formerly hid from the heathen world; it was only shown in dark types and distant prophecies, but now is revealed and made known by the Spirit of God. Jesus Christ is the Lord of glory; a title much too great for any creature. There are many things which people would not do, if they knew the wisdom of God in the great work of redemption. There are things God hath prepared for those that love him, and wait for him, which sense cannot discover, no teaching can convey to our ears, nor can it yet enter our hearts. We must take them as they stand in the Scriptures, as God hath been pleased to reveal them to us.</body></html>
