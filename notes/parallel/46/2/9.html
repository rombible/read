They are not to be found as here given anywhere in the Old Testament. It has therefore been suggested (Origen) that they are from some apocryphal book, or some book which has been lost, as is supposed many have been. Chrysostom also suggests that it may be a reference, not to a writing, but to historical facts, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm" title="And he came and dwelled in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.">Matthew 2:23</a>. None of these explanations would justify the use of that phrase, "it is written," with which these words are introduced, and which in the apostolic writings is confined to quotations from the Old Testament scriptures. It is not used where the words are taken from other sources (see, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-14.htm" title="And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints,">Jude 1:14</a>). Although the words given here are not to be found in the same sequence in any passage in the Old Testament, still there are phrases scattered through the writings of Isaiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm" title="For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, beside you, what he has prepared for him that waits for him.">Isaiah 64:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm" title="For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.">Isaiah 65:17</a>; see also Isa 62:15 in the LXX.), which would easily be joined together in memory and resemble even verbally the passage as written here by the Apostle. This is not the only place in which St. Paul would seem to thus refer to the Old Testament scriptures (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.">1Corinthians 1:19-20</a>) when he is not basing any argument upon a particular sentence in the Scriptures, but merely availing himself of some thoughts or words in the Old Testament as an illustration of some truth which he is enforcing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as it is written.</span> The whole sentence in the Greek is unfinished. The thought seems to be, "But God has revealed to us things which eye hath not seen, etc., though the princes of this world were ignorant of them." Scriptural quotations are often thus introduced, apart from the general grammar of the sentence, as in the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Eye hath not seen,</span> etc. The Revised Version is here more literal and accurate. The quotation as it stands is not found in the Old Testament. It most resembles <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, but also vaguely resembles Isaiah 53:15; 65:17. It may be another instance of a loose general reminiscence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>). "Non verbum e verbo expressit," says St. Jerome, "sed <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;</span> aliis sermonibus indicavit." St. Chrysostom regards the words as part of a lost prophecy. Origen, Zacharias of Chrysopolis, and others say that the words occurred in an apocryphal book, the 'Apocalypse of Elias,' but if so the apocryphal writer must have had the passage of Isaiah in his mind. Some regard the words as a fragment of some ancient liturgy. Origen thought that they came from the 'Revelation of Elijah.' They were also to be found in the 'Ascension of Isaiah' (Jerome on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>). and they occur in the Talmud (Sanhedr. 99 a). In a curious fragment of Hegesippus (circ. <span class="date">A.D. 150</span>) preserved in Photius (Cod. 232.), that old writer indignantly repudiates this passage, saying that it is futile and "utterly belies (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the Holy Scriptures and the Lord, who says, 'Blessed are your eyes which see, and your ears which hear.'" Photius cannot understand why (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>) Hegesippus should speak thus. Routh ('Rel. Sacr.,' 253) hardly knows how to excuse him; but perhaps if we had the context of the fragment we should see that he is attacking, not the words themselves, but some perversion of them by heretics, like the Docetae. The phrase, "As it is written," decisively marks an intention to refer to Scripture. Neither have entered into the heart of man; literally, <span class="accented">things which have not set foot upon the heart.</span> The general thought is that God's revelations (for the immediate reference is to <span class="accented">these</span>, and <span class="accented">not</span> to future bliss) pass all understanding. The quotation of these words as referring to heaven is one of the numberless instances of texts inaccurately applied. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:6-9 Those who receive the doctrine of Christ as Divine, and, having been enlightened by the Holy Spirit, have looked well into it, see not only the plain history of Christ, and him crucified, but the deep and admirable designs of Divine wisdom therein. It is the mystery made manifest to the saints, Col 1:26, though formerly hid from the heathen world; it was only shown in dark types and distant prophecies, but now is revealed and made known by the Spirit of God. Jesus Christ is the Lord of glory; a title much too great for any creature. There are many things which people would not do, if they knew the wisdom of God in the great work of redemption. There are things God hath prepared for those that love him, and wait for him, which sense cannot discover, no teaching can convey to our ears, nor can it yet enter our hearts. We must take them as they stand in the Scriptures, as God hath been pleased to reveal them to us.</body></html>
