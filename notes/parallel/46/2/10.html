The Apostle gives two proofs that the Apostles have this knowledge, and that the Holy Spirit is the source of it: 1. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.">1Corinthians 2:10-11</a>), because the Holy Spirit alone is capable of imparting this knowledge; and 2. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.">1Corinthians 2:12-16</a>), because the Holy Spirit has been given to <span class= "ital">us</span> the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">Searcheth all things.</span>--The word "searcheth" here does not convey the idea of inquiry for the purpose of acquiring knowledge, but rather complete and accurate knowledge itself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm" title="And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.">Romans 8:27</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-1.htm" title="O lord, you have searched me, and known me.">Psalm 139:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But God hath revealed them unto us.</span> They are secret no longer, but are "mysteries which now it is given us to know" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By his Spirit.</span> The Spirit guides into all truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-16.htm">John 13:16</a>). In ch. 12:8-11 St. Paul attributes every gift of wisdom directly to him. <span class="cmt_word">Searcheth</span>. "How unsearchable are his judgments!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, the deep things of God.</span> This expression, "The depths of God," passed into the cant expression of the Gnostics, and it may be with reference to their misuse of it that St. John uses the phrase, "The depths of Satan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-24.htm">Revelation 2:24</a>). "Oh, the depth," etc.! (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 God has revealed true wisdom to us by his Spirit. Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.</body></html>
