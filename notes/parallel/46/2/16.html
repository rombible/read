The Apostle here identifies Christ with the Spirit, whom he has previously spoken of as the Teacher of spiritual things. He does not mean to assert that the Apostles knew all that the mind of Christ knew, but that all things which they did know were from Him and spiritual (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-15.htm" title="From now on I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.">John 15:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath known the mind of the Lord?</span> "The Lord" is Jehovah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13</a>, LXX.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a>). This is the <span class="accented">reason</span> why no one can judge the spiritual man in his spiritual life. To do so is like judging God. <span class="cmt_word">We have the mind of Christ.</span> So Christ himself had told the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>); and St. Paul always claimed to have been taught by direct revelation from Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>). They had the <span class="accented">Spirit</span> of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>), and therefore the <span class="accented">mind</span> of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 God has revealed true wisdom to us by his Spirit. Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.</body></html>
