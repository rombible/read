It may seem strange that the word "idolater" should be included in this category; for in what sense could a "brother" be a worshipper of idols? It is probable that the word "idolater" has involved in it the idea, not merely of worshipping an image, but of the sensuality which accompanied various forms of heathen worship, and of which evidently some of the Corinthian brethren were partakers. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>, where "idolatry" is identified with a vice kindred to lasciviousness.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now I have written unto you.</span> The tense used is, perhaps, the epistolary aorist, and is therefore equivalent to "but now I write to you;" otherwise the sense is, "but what I <span class="accented">meant</span> in my letter was," etc. The position of the words rather favours this view. St. Paul expressly tells them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-27.htm">1 Corinthians 10:27</a> that he never intended to forbid all intercourse with heathens. They were not to be "taken out of the world," but to be free from evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If any man that is called a brother.</span> The word "brother" was used before the name "Christian" was accepted by the members of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Or an idolater</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7, 14</a>). He might call himself a Christian, and yet be in reality an idolater (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With such a one no not to eat</span>.
