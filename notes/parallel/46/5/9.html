It has been suggested by some who adopt the latter view that these words may have been added as an interpolation after the completion of the Epistle, and be intended to intensify the remarks made by the Apostle on this subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?">1Corinthians 5:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,">1Corinthians 6:9-20</a>. Such an interpretation, however, seems rather strained. It is more natural to suppose that the reference is to an Epistle written to the Corinthians, probably from Ephesus, after a visit paid to Corinth of which we have no record, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.">2Corinthians 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.">2Corinthians 13:1</a>, we read of a third visit being contemplated, whereas only one previous one is recorded. (See also <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) The condition of the Church which caused the Apostle that "heaviness," which he connects with this visit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.">2Corinthians 2:1</a>, would naturally have given rise to an Epistle containing the kind of direction here referred to.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-13.</span> - <span class="accented">Correction of a mistaken inference which they had deduced from a former letter of St. Paul's.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In an Epistle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in</span> the <span class="accented">Epistle</span>; <span class="accented">in</span> some former letter to the Church, which is no longer extant (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>). The attempt to get rid of so plain a statement, in the supposed interests of some superstitious notion that every line which an apostle wrote to a Church must necessarily have been inspired and infallible, is at once unscriptural and grossly superstitious. The notion that "the Epistle" intended is <span class="accented">this</span> Epistle is an absurdity invented in the interests of the same fiction. The only hypothesis which could give the least plausibility to such a view is that which makes this paragraph a postscript or marginal addition after the letter was finished; but there is little or nothing in favour of such a view. <span class="cmt_word">Not to company with.</span> The Greek word is rather stronger: <span class="accented">not to be mingled up among</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:14</a>). The spirit of the injunction is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>, "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-13 Christians are to avoid familiar converse with all who disgrace the Christian name. Such are only fit companions for their brethren in sin, and to such company they should be left, whenever it is possible to do so. Alas, that there are many called Christians, whose conversation is more dangerous than that of heathens!</body></html>
