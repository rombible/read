(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.">1Corinthians 7:1</a>.) So long as there is that one bad person amongst you it gives a bad character to the whole community, as leaven, though it may not have pervaded the entire lump, still makes it not the unleavened bread which was necessary for the Paschal Feast. This Epistle being written shortly before Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm" title="But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.">1Corinthians 16:8</a>), it was very likely some time about or soon after Easter, hence the leaven and the Paschal Feast naturally suggest themselves as illustrations. The Apostle passes on rapidly from the mention of the leaven to the whole scene of the feast. As with the most minute and scrupulous care the Jew would remove every atom of leaven when the Paschal lamb was to be eaten, so our Paschal Lamb having been slain, we must take care that no moral leaven remains in the sacred household of the Church while she keeps her perpetual feast of prayer and thanksgiving.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your glorying;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the subject of your boasting, the point on which you glorify yourselves.</span> The Greek word does not mean the act of boasting, but the thing of which we boast. <span class="cmt_word">Not good</span>. The Greek word is not <span class="accented">agathon</span>, but <span class="accented">kalon</span>, an almost untranslatable word, which implies all moral beauty, and resembles the English word "fair" or "noble." When he says that it is "not good," he uses the figure called <span class="accented">litotes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he employs an expression intentionally too weak, that it may be corrected into a stronger one by the involuntary indignation of the reader; as when Virgil calls the cannibal tyrant Busiris "unpraised." Hence the clause is equivalent to "the thing of which you are boasting is detestable." <span class="cmt_word">Know ye not.</span> This clause is used by St. Paul in specially solemn appeals, and almost exclusively in these Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-16.htm">1 Corinthians 6:16, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>). The taint alluded to is not only the presence of the unpunished offender, but the general laxity and impurity displayed by their whole bearing in the matter (comp. the line of Menander quoted in ch. 15:33, and the "root of bitterness" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>). (For the word "lump," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm">Romans 11:16</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The apostle notices a flagrant abuse, winked at by the Corinthians. Party spirit, and a false notion of Christian liberty, seem to have saved the offender from censure. Grievous indeed is it that crimes should sometimes be committed by professors of the gospel, of which even heathens would be ashamed. Spiritual pride and false doctrines tend to bring in, and to spread such scandals. How dreadful the effects of sin! The devil reigns where Christ does not. And a man is in his kingdom, and under his power, when not in Christ. The bad example of a man of influence is very mischievous; it spreads far and wide. Corrupt principles and examples, if not corrected, would hurt the whole church. Believers must have new hearts, and lead new lives. Their common conversation and religious deeds must be holy. So far is the sacrifice of Christ our Passover for us, from rendering personal and public holiness unnecessary, that it furnishes powerful reasons and motives for it. Without holiness we can neither live by faith in him, nor join in his ordinances with comfort and profit.</body></html>
