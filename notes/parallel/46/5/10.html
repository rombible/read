It would have been almost impossible for the command to be literally obeyed without the Christian withdrawing altogether from the business of life, so the Apostle explains that it is the fair fame and purity of the Church which he is anxious to preserve. There are so many fornicators, and covetous, and idolaters in this world (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the heathen world) that men <span class= "ital">must</span> meet with them. But the Christian must tolerate no such sins among themselves; they must exclude from the social circle any brother who, bearing the name of Christ, indulges in the vices of the heathen world. The Church is to be the light of the world, and not the recipient of the world's darkness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet</span> <span class="cmt_word">not altogether.</span> The words correct a false inference, and mean, "I did not intend absolutely to prohibit all communication with Gentiles guilty of this sin under all circumstances." <span class="cmt_word">Of this world.</span> Those outside the pale of the Christian Church (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Or with the covetous.</span> St. Paul often uses the Greek word in immediate connection with sins of impurity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-10.htm">1 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-5.htm">2 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>), and, though it does not exclude the connotation of greed and avarice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>), it seems to have been used euphemistically of the deadliest form of heathen sensuality. The principle of selfishness may work equally in greed and in lust. <span class="cmt_word">Extortioners</span>. The word may also mean "ravishers," but there is no reason to abandon the sense of "rapacious." <span class="cmt_word">Idolaters</span>. This is the earliest instance of the use of this word, which does not occur in the LXX. No Christian could still be an open "idolater." So, unless we suppose that the expression has slipped in involuntarily, we must here give the word a metaphorical sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>. We must else be driven to suppose that there were some half and half Christians, like Constantine, who "feared the Lord, and served their own gods" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For then must ye needs go out of the world;</span> <span class="accented">for in that case</span> (as they had perhaps implied in their letter of questions to St. Paul) <span class="accented">ye would have been morally bound to leave the world altogether</span> and seek a new one. The Greek particle <span class="accented">ara</span> perhaps refers to the astonishment caused by their misapprehension of St. Paul's rule. The clause throws painful light on the condition of the heathen world. If all communication with "fornicators" was to be forbidden, the sin was so universal, especially at Corinth, that all intercourse with Gentiles would have be. come impossible. Even some who professed to be stern moralists among the heathen, like Cato and Cicero, looked on the sin as being, at the worst, quite venial, and even, under certain circumstances, commendable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-13 Christians are to avoid familiar converse with all who disgrace the Christian name. Such are only fit companions for their brethren in sin, and to such company they should be left, whenever it is possible to do so. Alas, that there are many called Christians, whose conversation is more dangerous than that of heathens!</body></html>
