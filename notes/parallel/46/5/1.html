The force of the statement is that the fornication was of such a kind (with a stepmother) as even the Gentile world, immoral as it was, regarded with disgust, and how infinitely worse, then, was it to find such tolerated amongst Christians, whose moral standard ought to be much higher.<p><span class= "bld">One should</span> <span class= "bld">have his</span> <span class= "bld">father's wife.</span>--The word "have" here used always implies in the New Testament actual marriage. It is, therefore, probable that she had been divorced from his father. The word for "his father's wife" is the Hebrew form of expression for stepmother. St. Chrysostom suggests "he said not his 'stepmother,' but 'his father's wife,' so as to strike much more severely;" but probably St. Paul used the Hebrew phrase instead of the ordinary Greek word for "stepmother," as it was in this phraseology that such a union was forbidden by the law of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-8.htm" title="The nakedness of your father's wife shall you not uncover: it is your father's nakedness.">Leviticus 18:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - <span class="accented">Excommunication of an incestuous offender.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is reported.</span> The abruptness with which the subject is introduced shows <span class="cmt_word">the</span> intensity of St. Paul's feelings, and his indignation that he should have been left to hear of this crime by common report. The news had come to him "from those of Chloe's household." But St. Paul was not acting on mere "report." The Greek phrase <span class="accented">implies</span>, "It is notorious that there is uncleanness among you." St. Paul must have felt it to be a bad feature in the character of the Corinthian Church that they had not mentioned this gross scandal in their letter. <span class="cmt_word">Commonly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">actually</span> or <span class="accented">absolutely</span>; Elsewhere in the New Testament the worn only occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-24.htm">Matthew 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-29.htm">1 Corinthians 15:29</a>. Tertullian renders it "in totum." St. Paul has no need in this instance to name his informants. Every one knew of this scandal. <span class="cmt_word">Fornication</span>; a general word for all kinds of impurity. <span class="cmt_word">And</span>. The word involves an indignant climax, "Yes, and uncleanness of such a kind that," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Is not so much as named.</span> The true reading is, <span class="accented">does not even exist.</span> This form of incest was, indeed, "named" among the Gentiles, for it forms the basis of the story of Hippolytus, the scene of which was in the neighbourhood of Corinth; but the feelings even of pagans were so shocked by it that Cicero alludes to such a crime in the words, "Oh, incredible wickedness, and except in this woman's case - unheard of in all experience!" ('Pro Cluent.,' 5). At this very epoch Nero deepened the general execration against himself by the generally accepted suspicion that he had been guilty of a yet more flagrant crime. <span class="cmt_word">Should have;</span> rather, that <span class="accented">a certain person has his father's wife.</span> Apparently this was some nominal Christian, who was living in open sin with his stepmother, and thereby braving the curse of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a>. We gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-12.htm">2 Corinthians 7:12</a> that the father was living, and had also joined the Christian community. From the complete silence as to the crime of the woman, it must be inferred that she was a heathen. Whether she had been divorced or not does not appear, nor whether the offender was nominally married to her or not. <span class="cmt_word">His father's wife.</span> He might have used the one Greek word for stepmother (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>), but the periphrasis might remind some of the heinousness of the sin, and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The apostle notices a flagrant abuse, winked at by the Corinthians. Party spirit, and a false notion of Christian liberty, seem to have saved the offender from censure. Grievous indeed is it that crimes should sometimes be committed by professors of the gospel, of which even heathens would be ashamed. Spiritual pride and false doctrines tend to bring in, and to spread such scandals. How dreadful the effects of sin! The devil reigns where Christ does not. And a man is in his kingdom, and under his power, when not in Christ. The bad example of a man of influence is very mischievous; it spreads far and wide. Corrupt principles and examples, if not corrected, would hurt the whole church. Believers must have new hearts, and lead new lives. Their common conversation and religious deeds must be holy. So far is the sacrifice of Christ our Passover for us, from rendering personal and public holiness unnecessary, that it furnishes powerful reasons and motives for it. Without holiness we can neither live by faith in him, nor join in his ordinances with comfort and profit.</body></html>
