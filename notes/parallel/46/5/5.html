By cutting off an offender from Church communion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:14, 15</a>), that is, from all the visible means of grace, he was for the time separated from spiritual influences, and was, therefore, so far handed over to Satan. The phrase is also applied to Hymenaeus and Alexander, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>. It is very doubtful whether it was necessarily meant to involve such physical inflictions as fell on Ananias, Sapphira, or Elymas. It is, however, important to observe that the intention of the sentence, like the true intention of excommunication, when exercised in a right spirit (see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3:1, &sect; 13), was not wrathful, but merciful. It was, as Calvin says, "medicinale remedium" - "not for destruction, but for edification" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>). Hymenaeus and Alexander were handed to Satan, not for their final ruin and damnation, but with a kind and remedial purpose, "that they may learn not to blaspheme" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>), and this offender with the express object ', that his spirit may be saved." Had these facts been more deeply studied, there would have been a very different tone and spirit in many of the mediaeval anathemas. <span class="accented">Such a one</span> (setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>).

So "such as she" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) is used of the adulteress in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For the destruction of the flesh;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that all <span class="accented">carnal influences</span> in him might be destroyed. It is not his "body" which is to be destroyed, but the , "flesh," the <span class="accented">jetzer hara</span>, or "evil impulse," as the Jews called it. When this was destroyed, the body might once more become a temple of the Holy Ghost. <span class="cmt_word">That the spirit may be saved.</span> The destruction of the lowest element of our human nature is the salvation of the highest; it is the cutting away of the dead corpse from the living soul. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of the Lord;</span> when the Lord should judge the quick and the dead. The merciful intention of St. Paul is clearly developed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-6.htm">2 Corinthians 2:6-11</a>. He looked on God's judgments as <span class="accented">remedial</span>, not as solely retributive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-29.htm">1 Corinthians 11:29-32</a>). Here, as Chrysostom finely says, the apostle lays down, as it were, his laws to the devil, telling him how far, and how far <span class="accented">only</span>, he can proceed. The object of excommunication is to save the offender, and not to do the devil's work by ensuring his eternal ruin. We can imagine how awful would be the solemnity of these words when they were first read aloud to the little Christian communities of Corinth. It was natural that they should produce an overwhelming excitement. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The apostle notices a flagrant abuse, winked at by the Corinthians. Party spirit, and a false notion of Christian liberty, seem to have saved the offender from censure. Grievous indeed is it that crimes should sometimes be committed by professors of the gospel, of which even heathens would be ashamed. Spiritual pride and false doctrines tend to bring in, and to spread such scandals. How dreadful the effects of sin! The devil reigns where Christ does not. And a man is in his kingdom, and under his power, when not in Christ. The bad example of a man of influence is very mischievous; it spreads far and wide. Corrupt principles and examples, if not corrected, would hurt the whole church. Believers must have new hearts, and lead new lives. Their common conversation and religious deeds must be holy. So far is the sacrifice of Christ our Passover for us, from rendering personal and public holiness unnecessary, that it furnishes powerful reasons and motives for it. Without holiness we can neither live by faith in him, nor join in his ordinances with comfort and profit.</body></html>
