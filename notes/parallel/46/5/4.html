Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>). In this sentence we recognise, not merely a formal excommunication from church-fellowship, but a more severe punishment, which could only be inflicted by apostolic authority and power. Satan was regarded as the origin of all physical evil--hence the afflicted woman, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-16.htm" title="And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, see, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?">Luke 13:16</a>, is spoken of as one "whom Satan hath bound these eighteen years." St. Paul's own bodily suffering is a "messenger of Satan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>). The blindness of Elymas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-8.htm" title="But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.">Acts 13:8</a>), and the death of Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-5.htm" title="And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.">Acts 5:5</a>), are instances of the infliction of bodily-suffering by the Apostles. The deliverance of an offender unto Satan would therefore mean the expulsion of such a one from the Christian communion, and if that failed the actual infliction of some bodily suffering such as would destroy the flesh (not the body, but the flesh, the source and origin of the evil). Explicit directions for the excommunication by the Church of an offender, are given in 1 Corinthians 7, but there is no direct instruction to inflict the further punishment spoken of here. It is, indeed, probable that the lesser punishment had the desired effect (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.">2Corinthians 2:6</a>), and we subsequently find St. Paul pleading for the loving re-admission of the offender into all the privileges of Christian communion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the Name of our Lord Jesus</span> Christ. The word "Christ" is probably <span class="cmt_word">an</span> addition. The clause may either be taken with "when ye are gathered together," or with "to deliver" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the power of our Lord Jesus.</span> Each clause adds solemnity to the scene in which St. Paul imagines himself as standing with them in the spirit, and joining with the assembly of the Church, and armed with the authority of Christ, while he pronounces on the offender the sentence on which he had already determined. That he could claim "the power of the Lord" resulted from his possession of the Holy Spirit. and the special commission to bind and to loose, to remit and to retain, on earth, which Christ had entrusted to the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The apostle notices a flagrant abuse, winked at by the Corinthians. Party spirit, and a false notion of Christian liberty, seem to have saved the offender from censure. Grievous indeed is it that crimes should sometimes be committed by professors of the gospel, of which even heathens would be ashamed. Spiritual pride and false doctrines tend to bring in, and to spread such scandals. How dreadful the effects of sin! The devil reigns where Christ does not. And a man is in his kingdom, and under his power, when not in Christ. The bad example of a man of influence is very mischievous; it spreads far and wide. Corrupt principles and examples, if not corrected, would hurt the whole church. Believers must have new hearts, and lead new lives. Their common conversation and religious deeds must be holy. So far is the sacrifice of Christ our Passover for us, from rendering personal and public holiness unnecessary, that it furnishes powerful reasons and motives for it. Without holiness we can neither live by faith in him, nor join in his ordinances with comfort and profit.</body></html>
