The word translated "sacrifice" is generally used in the New Testament in the sense simply of "slaying" or "killing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-4.htm" title="Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted calves are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage.">Matthew 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm" title="The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.">John 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm" title="There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,">Acts 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-13.htm" title="And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.">Acts 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-7.htm" title="And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.">Acts 11:7</a>); and in the similar expressions regarding our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-12.htm" title="Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.">Revelation 5:12</a>) the word is "wounded."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Purge out therefore.</span> The word "therefore" is absent from the best manuscripts, and the abruptness is more emphatic without it. No doubt the metaphor was suggested by the fact that St. Paul was writing about the time of the Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8</a>). The most essential requisite of the Jewish regulations, with which his whole training had made him so familiar, was the absolute putting away, and even destruction, of every trace of leaven, which was diligently sought for the day before the Passover began. The putting away of leaven was a type of sanctification. <span class="cmt_word">The old leaven</span>. "Old" as belonging to their unregenerate and unconverted condition; a remnant of the day when they had been Gentiles and Jews who had not known Christ. The least <span class="accented">willing</span> tolerance of the taint would cause it to work throughout the whole society. <span class="cmt_word">As ye are unleavened.</span> Leaven is the type of evil in its secret and corrupting workings. Ideally, Christians can only be addressed as "unleavened," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as "purged from their own old sins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm">2 Peter 1:9</a>); and it is the method of Scripture (indeed, it is the only possible method) to address Christians as being Christians <span class="accented">indeed</span>, and therefore in their <span class="accented">ideal</span> rather than their actual character. Some have taken these words to mean, "You are actually keeping the Passover, and therefore have no leaven among you;" but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the words cannot bear this meaning; nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> was St. Paul likely to appeal so prominently to a Jewish ordinance; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he is thinking of the Christian Easter, and only borrowing a casual illustration from the Jewish Passover. <span class="cmt_word">For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;</span> rather, in the true reading, for our <span class="accented">passover also was sacrificed - even Christ.</span> As Christians, the Gentile Corinthians certainly did not keep the Jewish Passover; but St. Paul reminds them that they too had a Passover - that for them, too a Paschal Victim had been offered, whose sacrificial blood had been shed for their redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>, "We have an altar.") <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The apostle notices a flagrant abuse, winked at by the Corinthians. Party spirit, and a false notion of Christian liberty, seem to have saved the offender from censure. Grievous indeed is it that crimes should sometimes be committed by professors of the gospel, of which even heathens would be ashamed. Spiritual pride and false doctrines tend to bring in, and to spread such scandals. How dreadful the effects of sin! The devil reigns where Christ does not. And a man is in his kingdom, and under his power, when not in Christ. The bad example of a man of influence is very mischievous; it spreads far and wide. Corrupt principles and examples, if not corrected, would hurt the whole church. Believers must have new hearts, and lead new lives. Their common conversation and religious deeds must be holy. So far is the sacrifice of Christ our Passover for us, from rendering personal and public holiness unnecessary, that it furnishes powerful reasons and motives for it. Without holiness we can neither live by faith in him, nor join in his ordinances with comfort and profit.</body></html>
