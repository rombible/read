But this word implies, in modern language, an abuse arising from misuse, and not, as in the original here, an abuse arising from over-much use. All the things mentioned in this series by the Apostle are right things; and the warning is against being in bondage to those things which are in themselves right and good, and not against any criminal use of them. Though they are not wrong in themselves, we are not to become slaves of them; we are to renounce them, "so as not to follow nor be led by them."<p><span class= "bld">For the fashion of this world passeth away.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for the outward form of this world is passing away</span> (the word translated "fashion" occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Philippians 2:8</a>). The allusion is not a merely general reference to the ephemeral nature of things temporal, but arises from the Apostle's conviction that the last days were already commencing, when the outward temporal form of things was being superseded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.">Revelation 21:1</a>). The word "for" does not introduce a reason for the immediately preceding injunction, but carries us back to the previous statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;">1Corinthians 7:29</a> : "the time is short," the intervening series of illustrative exhortations being parenthetical.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As not abusing it;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as not using it to the full</span> - not draining dry the cup of earthly advantages (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18</a>). Like Gideon's true heroes, we must not fling ourselves down to drink greedily of the river of earthly gifts, but drink them sparingly, and as it were with the palm of the hand. <span class="cmt_word">The fashion of this world passeth away.</span> So St. John says, "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof" (1 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>). It is but as the shifting scene of a theatre, or as a melting vapour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:25-35 Considering the distress of those times, the unmarried state was best. Notwithstanding, the apostle does not condemn marriage. How opposite are those to the apostle Paul who forbid many to marry, and entangle them with vows to remain single, whether they ought to do so or not! He exhorts all Christians to holy indifference toward the world. As to relations; they must not set their hearts on the comforts of the state. As to afflictions; they must not indulge the sorrow of the world: even in sorrow the heart may be joyful. As to worldly enjoyments; here is not their rest. As to worldly employment; those that prosper in trade, and increase in wealth, should hold their possessions as though they held them not. As to all worldly concerns; they must keep the world out of their hearts, that they may not abuse it when they have it in their hands. All worldly things are show; nothing solid. All will be quickly gone. Wise concern about worldly interests is a duty; but to be full of care, to have anxious and perplexing care, is a sin. By this maxim the apostle solves the case whether it were advisable to marry. That condition of life is best for every man, which is best for his soul, and keeps him most clear of the cares and snares of the world. Let us reflect on the advantages and snares of our own condition in life; that we may improve the one, and escape as far as possible all injury from the other. And whatever cares press upon the mind, let time still be kept for the things of the Lord.</body></html>
