"Calling" must not here be regarded in the modern sense of profession or condition in life; it is nowhere so used in the New Testament, but always signifies God's calling of us. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-29.htm" title="For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.">Romans 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>.) Continue to be Christians of the kind which God's call to Christianity made you. If you were circumcised--and so God's call into the Christian Church made you a circumcised Christian--continue so; don't do anything which would seem to imply that some other change in addition to your "call" was necessary to complete your admission to the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let every man abide in the same calling,</span> etc. In accordance with this general principle, which illustrates the distinction between Christianity and violent social revolutions, St. John the Baptist had not bidden publicans or soldiers to abandon their callings, but to do their duty in that state of life to which God had called them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-12.htm">Luke 3:12-14</a>). The "calling" alluded to is not what is described as "a vocation," a calling in life, but the condition in which we are when we are <span class="accented">called by God</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-24 The rules of Christianity reach every condition; and in every state a man may live so as to be a credit to it. It is the duty of every Christian to be content with his lot, and to conduct himself in his rank and place as becomes a Christian. Our comfort and happiness depend on what we are to Christ, not what we are in the world. No man should think to make his faith or religion, an argument to break through any natural or civil obligations. He should quietly and contentedly abide in the condition in which he is placed by Divine Providence.</body></html>
