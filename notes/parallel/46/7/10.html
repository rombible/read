In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-37.htm" title="If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.">1Corinthians 14:37</a> the Apostle expressly claims that all his commands as an Apostle should be regarded as "the commandments of the Lord," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a> the Apostle speaks of that knowledge into which he was guided by the Holy Spirit as given "by the word of the Lord." St. Paul must not therefore be regarded as here claiming for some of his instructions apostolic authority, and not claiming it for others. The real point of the contrast is between a subject on which our Lord Himself while on earth gave direct verbal instruction, and another subject on which He now gives His commands through His Apostle St. Paul. Christ had given directions regarding divorce (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-31.htm" title="It has been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce:">Matthew 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/19-3.htm" title="The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?">Matthew 19:3-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/10-2.htm" title="And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.">Mark 10:2-12</a>), and the Apostle here has only to reiterate what the Lord had already commanded.<p><span class= "bld">Let not the wife depart from her husband.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Let her not be separated.</span> The account of our Lord's words given here differs in two respects from the record given of them by St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her which is put away does commit adultery.">Matthew 19:9</a>), where the reference is, first and more prominently, to the man putting away his wife--not, as here, to the wife separating herself from her husband--and the exception made, "except it be because of fornication," is here omitted. The fact that St. Paul only knew from others what our Lord had said, and that the Evangelists wrote what they had heard themselves, would not sufficiently account for this difference; for surely these very Evangelists, or others who like them had heard the Lord's words, would have been St. Paul's informants. The reason of the variety in the two accounts is to be found, not in inaccurate knowledge on St. Paul's part, which we have no reason to suppose, but in the particular circumstances to which the Apostle was applying the teaching of Christ; and this verbal difference is an instructive indication to us of how the Apostles understood that even in the case of the Lord Himself it was the living spirit of His teaching, and not its merely verbal form, which was of abiding and universal obligation. There was no necessity here to introduce the one exceptional cause of divorce which Christ had allowed, for the subject under consideration is a separation voluntarily made, and not as the result of sin on the part of either husband or wife; so the mention here of that ground of exception would have been inapplicable, and have tended only to confuse.<p>The other point of difference--viz., the mention here of the woman more prominently as separating from the husband--does not in any way affect the principle of the teaching, and indeed our Lord probably did put the case in both ways. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-12.htm" title="And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.">Mark 10:12</a>.) It may be also that in the letter to which St. Paul was replying the doubt had been suggested by women, who were--as their sex is often still--more anxiously scrupulous about details of what they conceived to be religious duty; and the question having been asked concerning a woman's duty, the Apostle answers it accordingly, and adds the same instruction for the husband (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.">1Corinthians 7:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Unto the married;</span> to <span class="accented">Christians</span> who have already married. <span class="cmt_word">I command.</span> This is an injunction, not a mere permission as in ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">Not I,</span> <span class="cmt_word">but the Lord.</span> Because the rule had been laid down by Christ himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let not the wife depart.</span> By divorce or otherwise. The wife is mentioned, perhaps, because the Christian wife, in the new sense of dignity and sacredness which Christianity had bestowed upon her, might be led to claim this spurious freedom; or perhaps the Christian women of Corinth had been more impressed than their husbands by the Essene notions of purity. The exception of divorce being permissible in case of fornication is assumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-16 Man and wife must not separate for any other cause than what Christ allows. Divorce, at that time, was very common among both Jews and Gentiles, on very slight pretexts. Marriage is a Divine institution; and is an engagement for life, by God's appointment. We are bound, as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men, Ro 12:18, therefore to promote the peace and comfort of our nearest relatives, though unbelievers. It should be the labour and study of those who are married, to make each other as easy and happy as possible. Should a Christian desert a husband or wife, when there is opportunity to give the greatest proof of love? Stay, and labour heartily for the conversion of thy relative. In every state and relation the Lord has called us to peace; and every thing should be done to promote harmony, as far as truth and holiness will permit.</body></html>
