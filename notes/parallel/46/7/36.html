If any father thinks, by keeping his virgin daughter unmarried, he is acting in a way which may cause sin or scandal, then let him permit her to marry her suitor. The word "uncomeliness" is terribly illustrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>. (For "comely," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-35.htm">1 Corinthians 7:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-24.htm">1 Corinthians 12:24</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">His virgin.</span> Obviously a daughter or ward. <span class="cmt_word">Pass the flower of her age.</span> If she be more than twenty years old, which the ancients regarded as the <span class="accented">acme</span> of the woman's life. <span class="cmt_word">And need so require.</span> If there be some moral obligation or necessity in the case. <span class="cmt_word">Let them marry.</span> The "them" means the virgin and her unmarried lover. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:36-40 The apostle is thought to give advice here about the disposal of children in marriage. In this view, the general meaning is plain. Children should seek and follow the directions of their parents as to marriage. And parents should consult their children's wishes; and not reckon they have power to do with them, and dictate just as they please, without reason. The whole is closed with advice to widows. Second marriages are not unlawful, so that it is kept in mind, to marry in the Lord. In our choice of relations, and change of conditions, we should always be guided by the fear of God, and the laws of God, and act in dependence on the providence of God. Change of condition ought only to be made after careful consideration, and on probable grounds, that it will be to advantage in our spiritual concerns.</body></html>
