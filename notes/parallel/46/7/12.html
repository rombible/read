There still remains one class of marriages concerning which differences of opinion existed--viz., mixed marriages. In a church like Corinth there would have been, no doubt, many cases where one of the partners was a heathen and the other a Christian, arising from the subsequent conversion of only one of the married couple. This subject is treated of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12-16</a>. The words are emphatically, "If any man <span class= "ital">have already</span> a wife," &c. The case of a Christian marrying a heathen is not alluded to. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2Corinthians 6:14</a>, the marriage of a Christian to a heathen is forbidden.<p><span class= "bld">Speak I, not the Lord.</span>--The Apostle has no word of Christ's to quote on this point, it being one which did not arise during our Lord's life. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>.)<p>It is to be noticed that the Apostle, in giving his own apostolic instruction on this point, does not use the word "command," which he applied to our Lord's teaching, but the less authoritative "speak."<p><span class= "bld">A wife that believeth not.</span>--That is, a heathen. In some modern religious circles this whole passage has been used (as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2Corinthians 6:14</a>) as if by "unbeliever" St. Paul meant a careless Christian, or one who, in modern phraseology, was not "converted." The Apostle is referring under this designation to heathens, and the only case to which his teaching could now or ever apply would be when two heathens had been married, and subsequently only one had embraced the Christian faith. It is <span class= "ital">to</span> be noticed that both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="And the woman which has an husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.">1Corinthians 7:13</a> the being "pleased to dwell" is put only in reference to the partner who is a heathen, for the Apostle takes for granted that after the instructions he here gives to the Christian partner, no such desire for separation will arise on the part of a Christian.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Directions about mixed marriages.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the rest.</span> That is, to those who are married, but are heathen. They were the remaining class about whose duties the Corinthians had made inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">Not the Lord.</span> The Lord had made no express reference to such cases, since it had been no part of his mission to lay down minute details which would be duly settled from age to age by the wisdom taught by the Holy Ghost. <span class="cmt_word">She be pleased to dwell with him</span>. It is assumed that, if she did <span class="accented">not</span> please, the poor Christian convert would have no protection of his fights; pagan courts would regard conversion as a sufficient reason for breaking off marriages. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-16 Man and wife must not separate for any other cause than what Christ allows. Divorce, at that time, was very common among both Jews and Gentiles, on very slight pretexts. Marriage is a Divine institution; and is an engagement for life, by God's appointment. We are bound, as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men, Ro 12:18, therefore to promote the peace and comfort of our nearest relatives, though unbelievers. It should be the labour and study of those who are married, to make each other as easy and happy as possible. Should a Christian desert a husband or wife, when there is opportunity to give the greatest proof of love? Stay, and labour heartily for the conversion of thy relative. In every state and relation the Lord has called us to peace; and every thing should be done to promote harmony, as far as truth and holiness will permit.</body></html>
