If he be a slave, let him be cheered by remembering that he is a freedman belonging to Christ; and if he be a freeman, let him not despise the state of the one in servitude, realising that he himself is Christ's slave. A "freedman," as distinct from a "freeman," was one who had been in bondage but was now free.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is the Lord's freeman;</span> rather, <span class="accented">freedman.</span> Clearly the entire bearing of this verse favours the view which we have taken of the previous verse. <span class="cmt_word">Christ's servant.</span> The sharp antithesis of this verse was often present to the mind of the early Christians. They knew that the bondage of Satan was so crushing that mere earthly bondage was, in comparison, as nothing; and that the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, though it might seem to take the form of service, was the sole perfect freedom. The freedmen of sin are the most hopeless slaves; the servants of God alone are free (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:17-24 The rules of Christianity reach every condition; and in every state a man may live so as to be a credit to it. It is the duty of every Christian to be content with his lot, and to conduct himself in his rank and place as becomes a Christian. Our comfort and happiness depend on what we are to Christ, not what we are in the world. No man should think to make his faith or religion, an argument to break through any natural or civil obligations. He should quietly and contentedly abide in the condition in which he is placed by Divine Providence.</body></html>
