A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.">1Corinthians 7:15</a> as a general principle to be ever borne in mind, as limiting in practice the very broad liberty which the Apostle has given regarding separation in cases of mixed marriages. It is to be noticed that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.">1Corinthians 7:15</a> the unbelieving partner is the only one who is spoken of as taking an active part in the separation; the believer is, merely for the sake of peace, to acquiesce in it; he is never to cause or promote a separation, for he is to be guided by the great principle that we are to continue to walk in those social and political relations by which we were bound when God called us. Christianity does not destroy them, but purifies and exalts them, and thus makes them more binding on us than before. According as the Lord has divided to each man his portion in life, and as God has called each man, so in that condition let him continue to walk as a Christian. Let him not try to change it for another. The words "God" and "Lord" have been transposed by later copyists. The order in the English version is different from that in the older MSS. It is important to preserve the accurate reading here, for it speaks of Christ--"the Lord"--as the one who allots to men their natural condition in life, while "God" calls them from heathenism to the Christian faith.<p><span class= "bld">And so ordain I in all churches.</span>--This principle was of universal application, and the Apostle lays it down authoritatively for all Churches. The <span class= "ital">I</span> is emphatic, as the writer speaks with apostolic authority. It is noticeable that in some few later MSS. there is an attempt to weaken its force by the substitution of "I teach" for "I appoint or direct." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-24.</span> - <span class="accented">Corroborative instances of the duty of remaining in the state wherein each was called.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But;</span> literally, <span class="accented">if not.</span> The phrase introduces a caution.

It is the duty of every Christian to be content with his lot, and to conduct himself in his rank and place as becomes a Christian. Our comfort and happiness depend on what we are to Christ, not what we are in the world. No man should think to make his faith or religion, an argument to break through any natural or civil obligations. He should quietly and contentedly abide in the condition in which he is placed by Divine Providence.</body></html>
