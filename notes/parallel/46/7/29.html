Let us not for one moment think that this principle was evolved by St. Paul from a mistaken belief that the Second Advent was close at hand. This principle of life was taught by Christ Himself. He warned men against living carelessly because they thought "the Lord delayeth His coming." They were to be ever on the watch, as servants for the unexpected return of their master--as guests for the coming of the bridegroom. It was not the opinion that Christ would soon come which led St. Paul to hold and teach this principle of Christian life. Perhaps it was his intense realisation of this eternal truth which the Lord had taught, his assimilation of it as part of his very being, from which the conviction arose that the Advent was not only in theory always, but, as a matter of fact, then near at hand. Hope and belief mysteriously mingled together in one longing unity of feeling.<p>It may be asked, if the Apostles were mistaken on this point, may they not have been mistaken about other things also? The best answer to such a question, perhaps, is that this was just <span class= "ital">the</span> one point on which our Lord had said they <span class= "ital">should not</span> be informed, and it is the one point on which they <span class= "ital">were not</span> informed. "Times and seasons" were to be excluded from their knowledge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The time is short: it remaineth . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">The time that remains is shortened, so that both they that have wives,</span> &c. (the Greek word for "remain" (<span class= "ital">to loipon</span>) is used frequently by St. Paul in a sort of adverbial way, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Philippians 4:8</a>). The words "so that" do not introduce a series of apostolic exhortations based upon and growing out of the previous statement regarding the brevity of the remaining time, but they express what was God's intention in thus making the time short. St. Paul regards everything as having its place and purpose in the divine economy. If the time were long (and the teaching applies equally--for the principle is the same--to the brevity of life), then, indeed, men might live as having "much goods laid up for many years" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-19.htm" title="And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.">Luke 12:19</a>); but the time of life is short, that each may keep himself from being the slave of the external conditions and relationships of life. Such is the force of the series of striking contrasts with which the Apostle now illustrates the habit of life which God intended to follow from the shortening of the time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But this I say.</span> I will not dwell on those coming trials, but will only remind you that they are imminent, and that when they come all earthly distinctions will vanish into insignifiance. <span class="cmt_word">The time is short;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the season has been contracted</span>; in other words, "The end of all things is at hand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>). The word <span class="accented">sunestalmenos</span> cannot mean "disastrous." The verb is used for "folding up" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-6.htm">Acts 5:6</a>; "Tempus in collecto est" (Tertullian). It remaineth, that. The reading and punctuation are here uncertain. The best reading seems to be "The time has been shortened henceforth, in order that," etc. The very object of the hastened end is that Christians should sit loose to earthly interests. <span class="cmt_word">As though they had none.</span> They would thus be nearer to the condition of the "angels in heaven." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:25-35 Considering the distress of those times, the unmarried state was best. Notwithstanding, the apostle does not condemn marriage. How opposite are those to the apostle Paul who forbid many to marry, and entangle them with vows to remain single, whether they ought to do so or not! He exhorts all Christians to holy indifference toward the world. As to relations; they must not set their hearts on the comforts of the state. As to afflictions; they must not indulge the sorrow of the world: even in sorrow the heart may be joyful. As to worldly enjoyments; here is not their rest. As to worldly employment; those that prosper in trade, and increase in wealth, should hold their possessions as though they held them not. As to all worldly concerns; they must keep the world out of their hearts, that they may not abuse it when they have it in their hands. All worldly things are show; nothing solid. All will be quickly gone. Wise concern about worldly interests is a duty; but to be full of care, to have anxious and perplexing care, is a sin. By this maxim the apostle solves the case whether it were advisable to marry. That condition of life is best for every man, which is best for his soul, and keeps him most clear of the cares and snares of the world. Let us reflect on the advantages and snares of our own condition in life; that we may improve the one, and escape as far as possible all injury from the other. And whatever cares press upon the mind, let time still be kept for the things of the Lord.</body></html>
