What he does say is, that the foregoing instructions are not to be considered as absolute commands from him, but as general permissive instruction, to be applied by each individual according to circumstances.<p>It has been much discussed as to what part of the previous passage the word "this" refers. It is perhaps best to take it as referring to the leading thought of the whole passage, which is that marriage is allowable, expressed especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1Corinthians 7:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I speak this.</span> The "this" applies to his advice in general, but especially to the last verse. By permission. This phrase is generally misunderstood. It does not mean that <span class="accented">St. Paul was permitted</span> though not commanded to give this advice, but that his gentle advice was given "by way of permission" to Christians, not "by way of injunction." He means to say that he leaves the <span class="accented">details</span> of their lives, whether celibate or married, to their individual consciences, though with large hearted wisdom and charity he would emancipate them from human and unauthorized restrictions. The clause is not, therefore, a parallel to the restrictions on the authority of his utterances, such as we find in vers. 12, 29, 40, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The apostle tells the Corinthians that it was good, in that juncture of time, for Christians to keep themselves single. Yet he says that marriage, and the comforts of that state, are settled by Divine wisdom. Though none may break the law of God, yet that perfect rule leaves men at liberty to serve him in the way most suited to their powers and circumstances, of which others often are very unfit judges. All must determine for themselves, seeking counsel from God how they ought to act.</body></html>
