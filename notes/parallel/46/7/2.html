St. Paul gives a reason why those who wrote to him should marry, and the force of the argument does not extend beyond the immediate object in view. St. Paul's view of the higher aspects of matrimony are fully set forth when he treats of that subject generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless</span>. In this single word St. Paul practically refutes all the dangerous and unwarrantable inferences drawn by St. Jerome and others from the previous clause. St. Jerome argues: "If it is good for a man not to touch a woman, it must be bad to do so, and therefore celibacy is a holier state than marriage." He also says, "I suspect the goodness of a thing which the greatness of another evil enforces as a lesser evil." Such reasoning shows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The danger of pressing words to the full extent of the logical inferences which may be deduced from them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The errors which always arise from arguing upon isolated texts dissevered from their context, and from all consideration of the circumstances under which they were written. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The necessity of following the guidance of the Holy Spirit when he shows, by history and experience, the need for altering precepts with reference to altered conditions. There is in celibacy a moral beauty - it is <span class="accented">kalon</span>; there are cases in which it becomes a duty. But in most cases marriage, being no less a duty, as St. Paul proceeds to show, is even fairer and more excellent. Neither state, the wedded or the unwedded, is in itself more holy than the other. Each has its own honour and loveliness, and can only be judged of in connection with surrounding circumstances. Those who make St. Paul judge slightingly of marriage contradict his own express rules and statements (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-24.htm">Ephesians 5:24, 31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a>), and make him speak the current heathen language of heathen epicures, who, to the great injury of morals, treated marriage as a disagreeable necessity, which was, if possible, to be avoided. If the "it is a good thing" of St. Paul in ver. 1 were to be taken absolutely, it would have to be corrected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the example of Christ, who beautified with his presence the marriage at Cana (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1, 2</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the primeval law which said, "It is not good for man to be alone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the fact that marriage is the chosen analogue of the relation between Christ and his Church. But the very phrase he uses, as will be seen by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-21.htm">Romans 14:21</a>, etc., is a <span class="accented">relative</span> not an <span class="accented">absolute</span> one, and St. Paul uses it here concessively, but with the object of pointing out limitations which almost reversed it. To avoid <span class="cmt_word">fornication</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because o f fornication</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because of the many forms of impurity which were current every where, but especially at Corinth. Some have argued that St. Paul takes a "low" and "poor" view of marriage by regarding it only in the light of a remedy against fornication. The answer is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the reason which he assigns is a true reason in itself, and with reference to the masses of mankind; for which reason it is adopted by our Church in her Marriage Service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He is addressing those who were living in a corrupt and semi-heathen atmosphere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> He is not here speaking of the idealized and spiritual aspect of marriage, but only of large practical necessities. When he speaks of marriage as a high Christian mystery (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>), he adopts a very different tone. <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">every man have.</span> A rule, not a mere permission. He here implies the truth that married love bears no analogy whatever to the <span class="accented">vagae libidines</span> of those who live like "natural brute beasts." In marriage the sensuous impulse, by being controlled and placed under religious sanctions is refined and purified from a degradation into a sacrament. Instead of being any longer the source of untold curses to mankind, it becomes the condition of their continuance and an element in their peace, because it is then placed under the blessing of God and of his Church. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The apostle tells the Corinthians that it was good, in that juncture of time, for Christians to keep themselves single. Yet he says that marriage, and the comforts of that state, are settled by Divine wisdom. Though none may break the law of God, yet that perfect rule leaves men at liberty to serve him in the way most suited to their powers and circumstances, of which others often are very unfit judges.
