Even then it must not be from mere caprice, but for some religious purpose, such as a special season of prayer. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm" title="And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.">Exodus 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-4.htm" title="And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.">1Samuel 21:4</a>.) The alteration in the Greek text of the word "give<span class= "ital">"</span> into the present tense, so as to make the word "prayer" refer to daily devotions, and not to special and exceptional seasons, and the interpolation of the word "fasting"--not found in the older MSS.--are a striking example of how the ascetic tendencies of a particular ecclesiastical school of thought led to their "amending" the sacred text so as to make it be in harmony with their own views, instead of reverently regarding it as that by which those very views should be corrected.<p><span class= "bld">And come together again.</span>--Better (as in the best MSS.), <span class= "ital">and be together again.</span> This is still an explanation of the purpose of the separation, not to be a lasting one, but that we may again return to the state of union. The text here bears further traces of having been altered so as to make it seem that the Apostle meant that the return to matrimonial life should be only to a temporary union, and not to a continuous state of life. The proper reading implies the latter, the word "be" being used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm" title="And all that believed were together, and had all things common;">Acts 2:44</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For your incontinency.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">because of your incontinency;</span> the reference being, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1Corinthians 7:2</a>, to the moral condition surrounding them, and to the influence to which a man thus separated would be subject. The Corinthian Christians are here solemnly reminded that this sin, as all sin, is from Satan--because the Corinthians at large did not regard it as sin at all, but even mingled sensuality with worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Defraud ye not.</span> St. Paul purposely leaves the expression general. Primarily he is thinking of "the due" or "the power" which each has over the other, as is shown by the next verse; but he does not confine the expression to this. <span class="cmt_word">Except</span> it be; literally, <span class="accented">unless by chance.</span> The exception he regards as something possible, but not normal. <span class="cmt_word">For a time.</span> By this and the next words he disparages, by anticipation, the celibate and separate married lives which, in a corrupt age, were so much and so unwisely admired in the ascetic saints of the Middle Ages. Temporary separation for special reasons had been recognized from the earliest times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye may give yourselves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">ye may have leisure.</span> The verb is in the aorist, which shows that the "leisure" contemplated was for brief periods, not during continuous years. It was altered to the <span class="accented">present</span> by the officious copyists, who believed in external and mechanical rules of holiness. <span class="cmt_word">To fasting and prayer.</span> "Fasting" is an ascetic interpolation, not found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, D, F. On this interpolation, and perhaps on the analogy of the rule given by Moses at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>), rose the practice of married persons living apart at Lent (Stanley). <span class="cmt_word">Come together again.</span> The prepossessions of ascetic scribes have again tampered with the text. The true reading is, "be together again" (<span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), not "come together" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>For your incontinency;</span> rather, <span class="accented">because of.</span> Their past lives and their present temptations were a warning that they could not lay on themselves burdens which God did not require. They should not strive <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"...to wind themsleves to high<br />For sinful man beneath the sky."</span> Violent, unnatural, self tormenting, repressions beyond what God demands, and adopted without reference to the strength or the circumstances of individual natures, only tend, as all ascetics have confessed, to increase rather than to diminish the force of sensual temptations. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The apostle tells the Corinthians that it was good, in that juncture of time, for Christians to keep themselves single. Yet he says that marriage, and the comforts of that state, are settled by Divine wisdom. Though none may break the law of God, yet that perfect rule leaves men at liberty to serve him in the way most suited to their powers and circumstances, of which others often are very unfit judges. All must determine for themselves, seeking counsel from God how they ought to act.</body></html>
