Its derivation has been sought in Hebrew, Persian, Greek, and Sanskrit. The LXX. render <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>; Vulg., <span class= "ital">ferculum; </span>and it seems natural, with Gesenius, to trace the three words to the root common in <span class= "ital">parah, </span><span class= "greekheb">????</span><span class= "ital">, </span>fero, fahren, bear, and possibly the sign of such a common origin in the Sanskrit <span class= "ital">pargana = a saddle </span>(Hitzig). At all events, <span class= "ital">appiryon </span>must be a <span class= "ital">palanquin, </span>or <span class= "ital">litter, </span>both from the context, which describes the approach of a royal cortege, and from the description given of it, where the word translated <span class= "ital">covering </span>suggests the notion of a movable litter, rather than of a State bed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon. He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the seats of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, from the daughters of Jerusalem.</span> The palanquin is described, that the attention may be kept fixed awhile on the bridal procession, which, of course, forms the kernel of the whole poem, as representing the perfect union of the bride and bridegroom. The Greek versions translate <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ferculum.</span> We read in Athenaeus (5:13) that the philosopher and tyrant Athemon showed himself on "a silver-legged <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> with purple coverlet." There probably is some connection between the Hebrew <span class="accented">appiryon</span> and the Greek <span class="accented">phoreion</span>, but it is exceedingly doubtful if the Hebrew is merely a lengthened form of the Greek. Delitzsch derives the Hebrew from a root <span class="accented">parah</span>, "to cut or carve" anything of wood. The Greek would seem to be connected with the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, "to bear," "carry." The resemblance may be a mere coincidence. The rabbinical tradition is that the Hebrew word means "couch, or litter." Hitzig connects it with the Sanscrit <span class="accented">paryana</span>, meaning "saddle," "riding saddle," with which we may compare the Indian <span class="accented">paryang.</span> "bed." Others find a Chaldee root for the word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, "to run," as <span class="accented">currus</span> in Latin, or from a root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, "to shine," <span class="accented">i.e."</span> to be adorned." At all events, it would not be safe to argue the late date of the book from such a word as <span class="accented">appiryon</span>, on account of its resemblance to a Greek word. The "wood of Lebanon" is, of course, the cedar or cypress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>, etc.). There may be a covert allusion intended to the decoration of the temple as the place where the honour of the Lord dwelleth, and where he meets his people. The frame of the palanquin was of wood, the ornaments of silver. The references to the high value set upon silver, while gold is spoken of as though it was abundant, are indications of the age in which the poem was composed, which must have been nearly contemporaneous with the Homeric poems, in which gold is spoken of similarly. Recent discoveries of the tomb of Agamemnon, etc., confirm the literary argument. The palanquins of India are also highly decorated. The daughters of Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the ladies of the court, in their affection for King Solomon, have procured a costly tapestry, or several such, which they have spread over the purple cushion. Thus it is paved, or covered over, with the tokens of love - while all love is but a preparation for this supreme love. (For the purple coverings of the seat, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>.) The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> in the last clause is rendered differently by some, but there can be no doubt that the meaning is "on the part of," that is, coming from. The typical interpreter certainly finds a firm ground here. Whether we think of the individual believer or of the Church of God, the metaphor is very apt and beautiful - we are borne along towards the perfection of our peace and blessedness in a chariot of love. All that surrounds us speaks to us of the Saviour's love and of his royal magnificence, as he is adored by all the pure and lovely spirits in whose companionship he delights. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-11 A wilderness is an emblem of the world; the believer comes out of it when he is delivered from the love of its sinful pleasures and pursuits, and refuses to comply with its customs and fashions, to seek happiness in communion with the Saviour. A poor soul shall come up, at last, under the conduct of the Comforter; like a cloud of incense ascending from the altar, or the smoke of the burnt-offerings. This signifies pious and devout affections, and the mounting of the soul heaven-ward. The believer is filled with the graces of God's Spirit; his devotions now are very lively. These graces and comforts are from the heavenly Canaan. He, who is the Peace of his people, the King of the heavenly Zion, has provided for the safe conveyance of his redeemed through the wilderness of this world. The bed, or palanquin, was contrived for rest and easy conveyance, but its beauty and magnificence showed the quality of its owner. The church is well guarded; more are with her than are against her: believers, when they repose in Christ, and with him, though they have their fears in the night, are yet safe. The chariot here denotes the covenant of redemption, the way of our salvation. This is that work of Christ, which makes him loved and admired in the eyes of believers. It is framed and contrived, both for the glory of Christ, and for the comfort of believers; it is well ordered in all things and sure. The blood of the covenant, that rich purple, is the cover of this chariot, by which believers are sheltered from the wind and storms of Divine wrath, and the troubles of this world; but the midst of it is that love of Christ which passes knowledge, this is for believers to repose upon. Christ, in his gospel, manifests himself. Take special notice of his crown. Applying this to Christ, it speaks the honour put upon him, and his power and dominion.</body></html>
