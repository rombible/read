It seems possible that a portion of the bride's speech may have dropped out - "My beloved is mine" - or she may wish to adopt the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, and represent herself as a true wife, whose husband is wrapt up in her love. By "desire" is intended the impulse of love, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from a root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, "to move or impel." The thought seems to be this - As my beloved is full of worshipping affection, and I am wholly his, let his love have free course, and let us retire together away from all the distractions and artificiality of the town life to the simplicity and congenial enjoyments of the country, which are so much more to my taste. The more real and fervent the religious emotions of the soul and the spiritual life of the Church, the more natural and simple will be their expression. We do not require any profuse ceremonies, any extravagant decorations, any complicated and costly religions services, in order to draw forth in the Christian Church the highest realization of the Saviour's fellowship. We want the Christianity we profess to take possession of us, body and soul. And so it will be as Christians learn more of Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-13 The church, the believing soul, triumphs in its relation to Christ, and interest in him. She humbly desires communion with him. Let us walk together, that I may receive counsel, instruction, and comfort from thee; and may make known my wants and my grievances to thee, with freedom, and without interruption. Communion with Christ is what all that are made holy earnestly breathe after. And those who would converse with Christ, must go forth from the world. Wherever we are, we may keep up communion with God. Nor should we go where we cannot in faith ask him to go with us. Those who would go abroad with Christ, must begin early in the morning of their days; must begin every day with him, seek him early, seek him diligently. A gracious soul can reconcile itself to the poorest places, if it may have communion with God in them; but the most delightful fields will not satisfy, unless the Beloved is there. Let us not think to be satisfied with any earthly object. Our own souls are our vineyards; they should be planted with useful trees. We should often search whether we are fruitful in righteousness. Christ's presence will make the vine flourish, and the tender grapes appear, as the returning sun revives the gardens. If we can appeal to him, Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee; if his Spirit witness with our spirit, that our souls prosper, it is enough. And we must beg of him to search and try us, to discover us to ourselves. The fruits and exercises of graces are pleasant to the Lord Jesus. These must be laid up, and always ready; that by our bringing forth much fruit, he may be glorified. It is all from him, therefore it is fit it should be all for him.</body></html>
