This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. I said, I will climb up into the palm tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy breath like apples; and thy mouth like the best wine, that goeth down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips of them that are asleep.</span> The abstract "love" is plainly here used for the concrete, "O loved one." It is just possible that the meaning may be - How delightful is the enjoyment of love! but the bodily description which follows suggests that the words are addressed directly to Shulamith. We certainly have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, an apostolic apostrophe to love, which Delitzsch calls the Apostle Paul's spiritual song of songs. But it would be somewhat irrelevant here. The king is deeply moved as he watches the beautiful figure before him, and delights in the thought that so lovely a creature is his own. The rapture which he pours out may be taken either as a recollection of how he was captivated in the past, or the past may be used for the present, as it frequently is in Hebrew. The meaning is the same in both cases. The palm tree may be selected on account of its elegance, but it is commonly employed in Eastern poetry as the emblem of love. The mystical writers use it to denote the Divine manifestation. The comparison of the breasts to clusters of grapes is quite natural, but no doubt reference is intended to the fruit as luscious and refreshing. Both the palm and the vine in the East are remarkable for the abundance and beauty of their fruits. In the case of the palm - "dark brown or golden-yellow clusters, which crown the summit of the stem and impart a wonderful beauty to the tree, especially when seen in the evening twilight." The palm and the vine are both employed in Scripture in close connection with the Church. "The righteous shall flourish as the palm tree;" "The vine brought out of Egypt" (Ps <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>.), and the "vineyard of the beloved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>.), and the "true vine," to which the Lord Jesus Christ compares himself, remind us that the illustration was perfectly familiar among the Jews; and we can scarcely doubt that the reference in this case would be understood. The Lord delighteth in those "fruits of righteousness" which come forth from the life and love of his people. They are the true adornment of the Church. The people of God are never so beautiful in the eyes of their Saviour as when they are covered with gifts and graces in their active expression in the world. Then it is that he himself fills his Church with his presence. The ninth verse is somewhat difficult to explain. The words are no doubt still in the lips of the king. There is no change of speaker until ver. 10, when Shulamith replies to the king's adoring address. Ginsburg says, "Her voice is not merely compared to wine because it is sweet to everybody, but to such wine as would be sweet to a friend, and on that account is more valuable and pleasant." The Authorized Version is supported by some critics as the best, "causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak." Delitzsch adheres to this. The LXX. renders it thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "accommodating itself to my lips and teeth." So Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Jerome, <span class="accented">Labiisque et dentibus illius ad ruminandum.</span> Luther strangely renders, "which to my friend goes smoothly down and speaks of the previous year" (pointing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). Another rendering is, "which comes unawares upon the lips of the sleepers." Some think it refers to the smacking of the lips after wine. "Generous wine is a figure of the love responses of the beloved, sipped in, as it were, with pleasing satisfaction, which hover around the sleepers in delightful dreams, and fill them with hallucinations." Another reading substitutes "the ancient" for "them that are asleep." The general meaning must be wine that is very good and easily taken, or which one who is a good judge of wine will praise. It is possible that there is some slight corruption in the text. The passage is not to be rendered with absolute certainty. Delitzsch and others think that it is an interruption of the bride's, but they have little support for that view. The bride begins to speak at ver. 10. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The similitudes here are different from what they were before, and in the original refer to glorious and splendid clothing. Such honour have all his saints; and having put on Christ, they are distinguished by their beautiful and glorious apparel. They adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Consistent believers honour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners. The church resembles the stately and spreading palm; while her love for Christ, and the obedience resulting therefrom, are precious fruit of the true Vine. The King is held in the galleries. Christ takes delight in the assemblies and ordinances of his people; and admires the fruit of his grace in them. When applied to the church and to each faithful Christian, all this denotes that beauty of holiness, in which they shall be presented to their heavenly Bridegroom.</body></html>
