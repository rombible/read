The Marg., instead of <span class= "ital">yesheynim, </span>sleepers, reads <span class= "ital">yeshanim, </span>the ancient, which Luther adopts, translating "of the previous year." <span class= "ital">Ledodi, </span>for my beloved, is evidently either an accidental insertion of the copyist, the eye having caught <span class= "ital">dodi </span>in the next verse, or more probably is wrongly vowelled.

It is the old figure, comparing kisses to wine (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-2.htm" title="Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for your love is better than wine.">Song of Solomon 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-4.htm" title="He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.">Song of Solomon 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-1.htm" title="I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>).

Such honour have all his saints; and having put on Christ, they are distinguished by their beautiful and glorious apparel. They adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Consistent believers honour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners. The church resembles the stately and spreading palm; while her love for Christ, and the obedience resulting therefrom, are precious fruit of the true Vine. The King is held in the galleries. Christ takes delight in the assemblies and ordinances of his people; and admires the fruit of his grace in them. When applied to the church and to each faithful Christian, all this denotes that beauty of holiness, in which they shall be presented to their heavenly Bridegroom.</body></html>
