See end of <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>III.<p><span class= "bld">O prince's daughter</span>!--Heb. <span class= "ital">Bath-nadib </span>(the LXX. keep <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>)--evidently again suggested by <span class= "ital">Amminadib, </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-12.htm" title="Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.">Song of Solomon 6:12</a>. But as the allusion there cannot be recovered, nothing relating to the rank of the heroine can be deduced from the recurrence of <span class= "ital">nadib </span>(<span class= "ital">= </span>noble) here. The reference may be to character rather than descent, just as in the opposite expression, "daughter of Belial" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-16.htm" title="Count not your handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken till now.">1Samuel 1:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Joints.</span>--Heb. <span class= "ital">cham-k, </span>from <span class= "ital">chamah--</span>went away, probably refers to the rapid movements in dancing, and the image is suggested by the graceful curves formed by a chain or pendulous ornament when in motion. Or the reference may be to the contour of the person.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</span> To the ladies who are looking on the bride appears simply noble and royal. The word <span class="accented">naudhib</span> which is used, translated "prince's daughter," means "noble in disposition," and so in birth and rank, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113-8.htm">Psalm 113:8</a>; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-12.htm">Song of Solomon 6:12</a>, "the princely people." The description, which is perfectly chaste, is intended to bring before the eye the lithe and beautiful movements of an elegant dancer; the bendings of the body, full of activity and grace, are compared to the swinging to and fro of jewelled ornaments made in chains. The cunning workman or artist is one who is master of that which abides beautiful. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, like, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, "whose truthful work can be trusted." The description passes from the thighs or loins to the middle part of the body, because in the mode of dancing prevailing in the East the breast and the body, are raised, and the outlines of the form appear through the clothing, which is of a light texture. We must not expect to find a symbolical meaning for all the details of such a description. The general intention is to set forth the beauty and glory of the bride. The Church of Christ is most delightful in his sight when it is most full of activity and life, and every portion of it is called forth into manifest excellence. "<span class="accented">Arise</span>, <span class="accented">shine</span>," is the invitation addressed to the whole Church, "shake thyself from the dust," "put on thy beautiful garments," be ready for thy Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The similitudes here are different from what they were before, and in the original refer to glorious and splendid clothing. Such honour have all his saints; and having put on Christ, they are distinguished by their beautiful and glorious apparel. They adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Consistent believers honour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners. The church resembles the stately and spreading palm; while her love for Christ, and the obedience resulting therefrom, are precious fruit of the true Vine. The King is held in the galleries. Christ takes delight in the assemblies and ordinances of his people; and admires the fruit of his grace in them. When applied to the church and to each faithful Christian, all this denotes that beauty of holiness, in which they shall be presented to their heavenly Bridegroom.</body></html>
