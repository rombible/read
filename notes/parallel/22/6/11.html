But the connection between military sports and dancing has always been close in the East, and the custom now existing of performing a <span class= "ital">sword-dance </span>at weddings possibly gives the clue to this curious passage.<p>Some conjectural interpretations will be found in the <span class= "ital">Excursus, </span>but the whole passage is hopelessly obscure.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS III.--ON THE PASSAGE,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/6-11.htm" title="I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.">Song of Solomon 6:11-13</a>.<p>Translated word for word this passage runs as follows:--"Into the garden of nuts I descended to see the verdure of the valley, to see if the vine was shooting, if the pomegranates flourished. I did not know,--my soul,--put me,--chariots of my people--noble. Come back, come back the Shulamite. Come back, come back, in order that we may see thee. What do you see in Shulamite? Like the dance of two camps."<p><span class= "bld">This the LXX. translate:</span>--"Into the garden of nuts I descended to see among the vegetation of the torrent bed, to see if the vine flourished, if the pomegranate sprouted, <span class= "ital">there I will give thee my breasts. </span>My soul did not know, the chariots of Amminadab put me--return, return, Shunamite, return, return, and we will contemplate thee. What will you see in the Shunamite? She that cometh like choruses of the camps."<p>The Vulgate does not insert the promise of love, and reads: "and I did not know, my soul troubled me on account of the four-horsed chariots of Amminadab. Return, return, Shulamite, that we may look at thee. What wilt thou see in the Shulamite; if not the chorus of camps."<p>A comparison of the above seems to show--<p>(1) That the Hebrew text has not come down to us in its integrity.<p>(2) That the Greek translators had before their eyes another text.<p>(3) That neither they nor St. Jerome understood the text which came to them already incomplete.<p>Yet this impossible passage, "the rags of a text irremediably corrupt," has become for many scholars the key to the entire book. <span class= "ital">The heroine in</span> <span class= "ital">a moment of bewilderment strays into the midst of a cortege of King Solomon, who instantly falls in love with her; or perhaps into the midst of a detachment of his troops, who capture her for the royal harem, after a comparison of her simple country style of dancing with that of the trained court ladies. </span>This, or some similar device, is resorted to by most of those who construct an elaborate drama out of this series of love-lyrics, the whole structure falling to pieces when we see that on this, the centre, the only passage giving a possible incident on which to hang the rest, no reliance whatever can be placed, since it is so obviously corrupt.<p>The following are a few of various suggested translations of this piece:--<p>"My heart led me--I know not how--far from the troop of my noble people. Come back, come back, they cry, that we may see thee, Shulamite. What do you see in me, a poor Shulamite?"<p>"My desire made of me, so to speak, a chariot of my noble people," &c.<p>"My desire brought me to a chariot, a noble one," &c.<p><span class= "ital">"</span>Suddenly I was seized with fright,--chariots of my people the Prince!"<p>As to "the dance of Mahanaim," even if by itself intelligible, as a, reference to an old national dance, as we say "Polonaise," "Scotch dance," or as a dance performed by two choirs or bands (see Note <span class= "ital">ad loc.</span>) the connection with the context is almost inexplicable. The only suggestion which seems worthy of consideration, connects the words not with what precedes but with what immediately follows. If a word or words leading to the comparison, "like," &c, have dropped out, or if "like a dance of Mahanaim" may be taken as a kind of stage direction, to introduce the choric scene, the passage will become clear in the light thrown on it by the analogy of the modern Syrian marriage customs.<p>The question, "What do you see in Shulamite?" may be understood as a challenge to the poet to sing the customary "wasf" or eulogy on the bride's beauty, which accordingly follows in the next chapter. But before it began, a dance after the manner of the sword dance that forms at present a customary part of a Syrian wedding, would in due course have to be performed, and the words "(dance) like the dance of Mahanaim" would be a direction for its performance. See end of <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>II. on the form of the Poem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I went down into the garden of nuts to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded and the pomegranates were in flower. Or ever I was aware, my soul set me among the chariots of my princely people.</span> There cannot he much doubt as to the meaning of these words. Taking them as put into the lips of the bride, and as intended to be a response to the lavish praises of the bridegroom, we may regard them as a modest confession that she had lost her heart immediately that she had seen King Solomon. She went down into her quiet garden life to occupy herself as usual with rustic labours and enjoyments, but the moment that her beloved approached she was carried away - her soul was as in a swift chariot. Delitzsch thinks that the words refer to what occurred after marriage. He supposes that on some occasion the king Look his bride with him on an excursion in his chariot to a plain called Etam. He refers to a description of such a place to be found in Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:07, 3, but the explanation is far fetched and improbable. The nut or walnut tree (<span class="accented">Juglans regia</span>, Linn.) came originally from Persia. The name is very similar in the Persian, AEthiopic, Arabic, and Syriac. One cannot help comparing the lovely simplicity of the bride's description with the tender beauty of Goethe's 'Herman and Dorothea.' The main point is this, that she is not the mere captive of the king, taken, as was too often the case with Eastern monarchs, by violence into his harem; she was subdued by the power of love. It was love that raised her to the royal chariots of her people. She beholds in King Solomon the concentration and the acme of her people's glory. He is the true Israel; she is the glory of him who is the glory of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:11-13 In retirement and in meditation the Christian character is formed and perfected. But not in the retirement of the idle, the self-indulgent, or the trifler. When the Christian is released from the discharge of his duties in life, the world has no attractions for him. His prayer is, that all things belonging to the Spirit may live and grow within him, and around him. Such are the interesting cares and employments of him whom the world wrongly deems unhappy, and lost to his true interests. In humility and self-abasement, the humble Christian would turn away from the sight of all; but the Lord delights to honour him. Chiefly, however, may the reference be to the ministering angels who shall be sent for the soul of the Christian. Their approach may startle, but the departing soul shall find the Lord its strength and its portion for ever. The church is called the Shulamite: the word signifies perfection and peace; not in herself, but in Christ, in whom she is complete, through his righteousness; and has peace, which he made for her through his blood, and gives unto her by his Spirit.</body></html>
