I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth his flock among the lilies.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5, 6</a> Solomon says, "I planted me vineyards; I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> it is said, "The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall be their Shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of water of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes." We can scarcely doubt that the meaning is - The bridegroom is not gone far; he is where he is congenially employed; where his pure and lovely nature finds that which is like itself - beauty and fragrance and innocence. It is his resort, and it corresponds with his perfection. Delitzsch thinks "thoughtfulness and depth of feeling are intended" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-5.htm">Psalm 92:5</a>). "His thoughts are very deep." But it would seem more fitting, in the lips of the bride, that she should dwell on the aspects of her beloved which correspond with her own feelings. She is one of the lilies. The king is coming into his garden, and I am ready to receive him. The shepherd among his flock. They are all like lilies, pure and beautiful. The bride has nothing but chaste thoughts of her husband: because she knows that he is hers, and she is his. Surely such language is not inaptly applied to spiritual uses. Tennyson's lovely poem, 'St. Agnes' Eve,' has caught the spirit of Shulamith. A few of his lines will illustrate this - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The shadows of the convent towers<br />Slant down the snowy sward,<br />Still creeping with the creeping hours<br />That lead me to my Lord.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Make thou my spirit pure and clear<br />As are the frosty skies,<br />Or this first snowdrop of the year<br />That in my bosom lies.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">He lifts me to the golden doors;<br />The flashes come and go;<br />All Heaven bursts her starry floors,<br />And strews her lights below,</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">And deepens on and up! the gates<br />Roll back, and far within<br />For me the heavenly Bridegroom waits,<br />To make me pure of sin.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">The sabbaths of eternity,<br />One sabbath deep and wide,<br />A light upon the shining sea -<br />The Bridegroom with his bride."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:2,3 Christ's church is a garden, enclosed, and separated from the world; he takes care of it, delights in it, and visits it. Those who would find Christ, must attend him in his ordinances, the word, sacraments, and prayer. When Christ comes to his church, it is to entertain his friends. And to take believers to himself: he picks the lilies one by one; and at the great day he will send forth his angels to gather all his lilies, that he may be for ever admired in them. The death of a believer is not more than the owner of a garden plucking a favourite flower; and He will preserve it from withering, yea, cause it to flourish for ever, with increasing beauty. If our own hearts can witness for us that we are Christ's, question not his being ours, for the covenant never breaks on his side. It is the comfort of the church, that he feeds among the lilies, that he takes delight in his people.</body></html>
