Probably the latter marks a later form of the traditions of the grand scale on which everything at the court of the monarch was conducted, and this, though a poetic, is a truer version of the story of his loves.

My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</span> The account given us of Solomon's harem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a> represents the number as much larger. Is not that because the time referred to in the poem was early in the reign? The words are an echo of what we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>. Perhaps the general meaning is merely to celebrate the surpassing beauty of the new bride. But there certainly is a special stress laid on her purity and innocence. There is no necessity to seek for any exact interpretation of the queens and concubines. They represent female beauty in its variety. The true Church is in closer relation to the Bridegroom than all the rest of the world. Even in the heathen and unconverted world there is a revelation of the Word, or, as the ancient Fathers of the Church said, a <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. He was then as light, though the darkness comprehended him not. The perfection of the true bride of the Lamb will be acknowledged even by those who are not professedly Christian. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:4-10 All the real excellence and holiness on earth centre in the church. Christ goes forth subduing his enemies, while his followers gain victories over the world, the flesh, and the devil. He shows the tenderness of a Redeemer, the delight he takes in his redeemed people, and the workings of his own grace in them. True believers alone can possess the beauty of holiness. And when their real character is known, it will be commended. Both the church and believers, at their first conversion, look forth as the morning, their light being small, but increasing. As to their sanctification, they are fair as the moon, deriving all their light, grace, and holiness from Christ; and as to justification, clear as the sun, clothed with Christ, the Sun of righteousness, and fighting the good fight of faith, under the banners of Christ, against all spiritual enemies.</body></html>
