The word rendered "looketh forth" is literally "bendeth forward," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in order to look out or forth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>), LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> Venet., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>, "stooping down and looking into the Word as into well"). The idea seems to be that of a rising luminary, looking forth from the background, breaking through the shades of the garden, like the morning star appearing above the horizon (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Venetian) (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>, where the morning star is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>). The moon is generally <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;</span>, "yellow," but here <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "white," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> pale and sweet, as the lesser light, with true womanly delicacy and fairness; but the rest of the description, which plainly is added for the sake of the symbolical suggestiveness of the figures, removes all idea of mere weakness. <span class="accented">Clear</span> (or, <span class="accented">bright</span>) <span class="accented">as the sun.</span> And the word for "sun" is not, as usual, <span class="accented">shemesh</span>, but <span class="accented">chammah</span>, "heat," the warming light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>). The fierce rays of the Eastern sun are terrible to those who encounter them. The glory of the Church is a glory overwhelming as against all that opposes it. The description is pure hyperbole as applied to a fair bride, referring to the blazing beauty of her face and adornments, but symbolically it has always been felt a precious contribution to religious language. Perhaps no sentence in the Old Testament has been more frequently on the lips of devout men, especially when they have been speaking of the victories of the truth and the glowing prospects of the Saviour's kingdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:4-10 All the real excellence and holiness on earth centre in the church. Christ goes forth subduing his enemies, while his followers gain victories over the world, the flesh, and the devil. He shows the tenderness of a Redeemer, the delight he takes in his redeemed people, and the workings of his own grace in them. True believers alone can possess the beauty of holiness. And when their real character is known, it will be commended. Both the church and believers, at their first conversion, look forth as the morning, their light being small, but increasing. As to their sanctification, they are fair as the moon, deriving all their light, grace, and holiness from Christ; and as to justification, clear as the sun, clothed with Christ, the Sun of righteousness, and fighting the good fight of faith, under the banners of Christ, against all spiritual enemies.</body></html>
