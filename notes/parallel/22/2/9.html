The young hart, or chamois, is probably so called from the covering of young hair (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-5.htm">Proverbs 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>). Shulamith represents herself as within the house, waiting for her friend. Her beloved is standing behind the wall, outside before the house; he is playfully looking through the windows, now through one and now through another, seeking her with peering eyes of love. Both the words employed, convey, the meaning of searching and moving quickly. The <span class="accented">windows</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the openings</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a window broken through a wall, or the meaning may be a lattice window, a pierced wooden structure. The word is not the common word for a window, which is <span class="accented">shevaka</span> (now <span class="accented">shabbaka</span>), from a root meaning "to twist," "to make a lattice." Spiritually, we may see an allusion to the glimpses of truth and tastes of the goodness of religion, which precede the real fellowship of the soul with God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-13 The church pleases herself with thoughts of further communion with Christ. None besides can speak to the heart. She sees him come. This may be applied to the prospect the Old Testament saints had of Christ's coming in the flesh. He comes as pleased with his own undertaking. He comes speedily. Even when Christ seems to forsake, it is but for a moment; he will soon return with everlasting loving-kindness. The saints of old saw him, appearing through the sacrifices and ceremonial institutions. We see him through a glass darkly, as he manifests himself through the lattices. Christ invites the new convert to arise from sloth and despondency, and to leave sin and worldly vanities, for union and communion with him. The winter may mean years passed in ignorance and sin, unfruitful and miserable, or storms and tempests that accompanied his conviction of guilt and danger. Even the unripe fruits of holiness are pleasant unto Him whose grace has produced them. All these encouraging tokens and evidences of Divine favour, are motives to the soul to follow Christ more fully. Arise then, and come away from the world and the flesh, come into fellowship with Christ. This blessed change is owing wholly to the approaches and influences of the Sun of righteousness.</body></html>
