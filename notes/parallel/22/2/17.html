Some have seen in such words a clear indication of a clandestine interview, and would find in them a confirmation of their hypothesis that the poem is founded on a romantic story of Solomon's attempt to draw a shepherdess from her shepherd. But there is no necessity to disturb the flow of the bride's loving recollections by such a fancy. She is recalling the visit of her lover. How, at first, she declined his invitation to go forth with him to the vineyards, but with professions of love appealed to him to return to the mountains, and in the evening come once more and rejoice in her love. But the words may be rendered, "during the whole day, and until the evening comes, turn thyself to me," which is the view taken by some critics. The language may be general; that is, "Turn, and I will follow." "The mountains of Bether" are the rugged mountains; <span class="accented">Bether</span>, from a root "to divide," "to cut," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> divided by ravines; or the word may be the abstract for the concrete - "the mountains of separation" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the mountains which separate. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "decussated mountains." The Syriac and Theodotion take the word as for <span class="accented">beshamim, i.e.</span> offerings of incense (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). There is no such geographical name known, though there is Bithron, east of Jordan, near Mahauaim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-29.htm">2 Samuel 2:29</a>). The Chaldee, Ibn-Ezra, Rashi, and many others render it "separation" (cf. Luther's <span class="accented">scheideberge</span>). Bochart says, "Montes scissionis ita dicti propter <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> et <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>." The meaning has been thus set forth: "The request of Shulamith that he should return to the mountains breathes self-denying humility, patient modesty, inward joy in the joy of her beloved. She will not claim him for herself till he have accomplished his work. But when he associates with her in the evening, as with the Emmaus disciples, she will rejoice if he becomes her guide through the newborn world of spring. Perhaps we may say the Parousia ot the Lord is here referred to in the evening of the world" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>.). On the whole, it seems most in harmony with the context to take the words as preparing us for what follows - the account of the maiden's distress when she woke up and found not her beloved. We must not expect to be able to explain the language as though it were a clear historical composition, relating facts and incidents. The real line of thought is the underlying connection of spiritual meaning. There is a separation of the lovers. The soul wakes up to feel that its object of delight is gone. Then it complains. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:14-17 The church is Christ's dove; she returns to him, as her Noah. Christ is the Rock, in whom alone she can think herself safe, and find herself easy, as a dove in the hole of a rock, when struck at by the birds of prey. Christ calls her to come boldly to the throne of grace, having a great High Priest there, to tell what her request is. Speak freely, fear not a slight or a repulse. The voice of prayer is sweet and acceptable to God; those who are sanctified have the best comeliness. The first risings of sinful thoughts and desires, the beginnings of trifling pursuits which waste the time, trifling visits, small departures from truth, whatever would admit some conformity to the world; all these, and many more, are little foxes which must be removed. This is a charge to believers to mortify their sinful appetites and passions, which are as little foxes, that destroy their graces and comforts, and crush good beginnings. Whatever we find a hinderance to us in that which is good, we must put away. He feedeth among the lilies; this shows Christ's gracious presence among believers. He is kind to all his people. It becomes them to believe this, when under desertion and absence, and so to ward off temptations. The shadows of the Jewish dispensation were dispelled by the dawning of the gospel day. And a day of comfort will come after a night of desertion. Come over the mountains of Bether, the mountains that divide, looking forward to that day of light and love. Christ will come over every separating mountain to take us home to himself.</body></html>
