Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span> Winter; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the cloudy stormy time (<span class="accented">sethauv</span>). The Jews in Jerusalem to this day call rain <span class="accented">shataa.</span> The rain; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the showers. The flowers, or the flowery time, corresponding with the singing time. Several versions, as the LXX. and other Greek, Jerome in the Latin, and the Targum and Venetian, render, "the time of pruning," taking the <span class="accented">zamir</span> from a root <span class="accented">zamar</span>, "to prune the vine." It is, however, regarded by most critics as an onomatopoetic word meaning "song," "music," like <span class="accented">zimrah</span>, "singing." The reference to the voice of the turtledove, the cooing note which is so sweet and attractive among the woods, shows that the time of spring is intended. Ginsburg says wherever <span class="accented">zamir</span> occurs, either in the singular or plural, it means "singing" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>). The form of the word conveys the idea of the time of the action, as we see in the words for "harvest" (<span class="accented">asiph</span>) and "ploughing time" (<span class="accented">charish</span>). The fig tree and the vine were both employed as symbols of prosperity and peace, as the fig and grape were so much used as food (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>). The little fruits of the fig tree begin, when the spring commences, to change colour from green to red (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-13.htm">Mark 11:13</a>, where the Passover time is referred to). The word "to ripen" is literally, "to grow red or sweet." The blossoming vines give forth a very delicate and attractive fragrance. The description is acknowledged by all to be very beautiful. The invitation is to fellowship in the midst of the pure loveliness of nature, when all was adapted to meet and sustain the feelings of awakened love. The emotions of the soul are blended easily with the sensations derived from the outward world. When we carefully avoid extravagance, and put the soul first and not second, then the delights of the senses may help the heart to realize the deepest experience of Divine communion. But the bridegroom first solicits the bride. We reverse the true spiritual order when we place too much dependence on the influence of external objects or sensuous pleasures. Art may assist religion to its expression, but it must never be made so prominent that the artistic pleasure swallows up the religious emotion. Love of nature is not love of Christ. Love of music is not love of Christ. Yet the soul that seeks him may rejoice in art and music, because they blend their attractions with its devotion, and help it to be a joy and a passion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-13 The church pleases herself with thoughts of further communion with Christ. None besides can speak to the heart. She sees him come. This may be applied to the prospect the Old Testament saints had of Christ's coming in the flesh. He comes as pleased with his own undertaking. He comes speedily. Even when Christ seems to forsake, it is but for a moment; he will soon return with everlasting loving-kindness. The saints of old saw him, appearing through the sacrifices and ceremonial institutions. We see him through a glass darkly, as he manifests himself through the lattices. Christ invites the new convert to arise from sloth and despondency, and to leave sin and worldly vanities, for union and communion with him. The winter may mean years passed in ignorance and sin, unfruitful and miserable, or storms and tempests that accompanied his conviction of guilt and danger. Even the unripe fruits of holiness are pleasant unto Him whose grace has produced them. All these encouraging tokens and evidences of Divine favour, are motives to the soul to follow Christ more fully. Arise then, and come away from the world and the flesh, come into fellowship with Christ. This blessed change is owing wholly to the approaches and influences of the Sun of righteousness.</body></html>
