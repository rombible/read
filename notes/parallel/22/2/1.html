From its derivation, it should be a bulbous plant (<span class= "ital">batsal</span>--a bulb), and it happens that the flower which for other reasons best satisfies the requirements is of this kind, viz., the Sweet-scented Narcissus (<span class= "ital">Narcissus tazetta</span>)<span class= "ital">. "</span>Others have suggested the crocus, of which there are many species very common, but they are deficient in perfume, and there is no bulb more fragrant than the narcissus; it is, besides, one of which the Orientals arc passionately fond. While it is in flower it is to be seen in all the bazaars, and the men as well as the women always carry two or three blossoms, at which they are continually smelling" (Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of Bible, </span>p. 477). Dr. Thomson prefers the <span class= "ital">mallow, </span>from the fact that the Arabs call it khubbazey. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm" title="The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.">Isaiah 35:1</a>, the only other place where <span class= "ital">chabatseleth </span>occurs, the LXX., Vulg., and Chaldee render "lily," and many eminent moderns "autumn crocus." Here the LXX. and the Vulg. have <span class= "ital">flower.</span><p><span class= "bld">Of Sharon.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">of the plain, </span>as in the LXX. Here (as invariably except <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-16.htm" title="And they dwelled in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, on their borders.">1Chronicles 5:16</a>) the Hebrew has the article before <span class= "ital">sharon, </span>but without definite local allusion to the district north of Philistia. The verse is by many taken as a snatch of a song into which the heroine breaks in answer to the eulogies on her beauty. It is certainly spoken with modest and lowly intention: "I am a mere flower of the plain, a lily of the valley;" by no means like Tennyson's "Queen lily and rose in one."<p><span class= "bld">Lily.</span>--So the LXX. and Vulg.; Heb., <span class= "ital">shoshanath </span>(fem. of <span class= "ital">shoshan, </span>or <span class= "ital">sh-shan; </span>comp. name <span class= "ital">Susan</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>a word occurring seven times in the poem, three times in 1 Kings 7, and in the headings to Psalms 45, 60, 69, 80. The Arabs have the word, and apply it to any brilliantly coloured flower, as the tulip, anemone, ranunculus. Although many plants of the lily tribe flourish in Palestine, none of them give a predominant character to the flora. There are, however, many other plants which would in popular language be called lilies. Of these, the <span class= "ital">Irises </span>may claim the first mention; and Dr. Thomson (<span class= "ital">Land and Book, </span>p. 256) unhesitatingly fixes on one, which he calls <span class= "ital">Huleh Lily, </span>or the Lily of the Gospel and of the Song of Songs. "Our flower," he says, "delights most in the valleys, but it is also found in the mountains. It grows among thorns, and I have sadly lacerated my hands while extricating it from them. . . . Gazelles still delight to feed among them, and you can scarcely ride through the woods north of Tabor, where these lilies abound, without frightening them from their flowery pasture." Tristram, however, prefers the Anemone (<span class= "ital">A. coronaria</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>"the most gorgeously painted, the most conspicuous in spring, and the most universally spread of all the treasures of the Holy Land" (<span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of Bible, </span>p. 464).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 Believers are beautiful, as clothed in the righteousness of Christ; and fragrant, as adorned with the graces of his Spirit; and they thrive under the refreshing beams of the Sun of righteousness. The lily is a very noble plant in the East; it grows to a considerable height, but has a weak stem. The church is weak in herself, yet is strong in Him that supports her. The wicked, the daughters of this world, who have no love to Christ, are as thorns, worthless and useless, noxious and hurtful. Corruptions are thorns in the flesh; but the lily now among thorns, shall be transplanted into that paradise where there is no brier or thorn. The world is a barren tree to the soul; but Christ is a fruitful one. And when poor souls are parched with convictions of sin, with the terrors of the law, or the troubles of this world, weary and heavy laden, they may find rest in Christ. It is not enough to pass by this shadow, but we must sit down under it. Believers have tasted that the Lord Jesus is gracious; his fruits are all the precious privileges of the new covenant, purchased by his blood, and communicated by his Spirit; promises are sweet to a believer, and precepts also. Pardons are sweet, and peace of conscience sweet. If our mouths are out of taste for the pleasures of sin, Divine consolations will be sweet to us. Christ brings the soul to seek and to find comforts through his ordinances, which are as a banqueting-house where his saints feast with him. The love of Christ, manifested by his death, and by his word, is the banner he displays, and believers resort to it. How much better is it with the soul when sick from love to Christ, than when surfeited with the love of this world! And though Christ seemed to have withdrawn, yet he was even then a very present help. All his saints are in his hand, which tenderly holds their aching heads. Finding Christ thus nigh to her, the soul is in great care that her communion with him is not interrupted. We easily grieve the Spirit by wrong tempers. Let those who have comfort, fear sinning it away.</body></html>
