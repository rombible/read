Some, offended at the comparison of female beauty to that of a horse, think the rich trappings of a royal equipage suggested it, while on the other hand, the mention of the caparisoned steed may have suggested the reference to the lady's ornaments. But Anacreon (60) and Theocritus (Idyll xviii. 30, 31), and also Horace (Ode iii. 11), have compared female with equine beauty; and an Arab chief would not hesitate to prefer the points of his horse to the charms of his mistress.<p><span class= "bld">Chariots.</span>--The plural shows that the image is general, and with no reference to any one particular equipage. Pharaoh's teams are selected as pre-eminently fine by reputation. The supposition that there is a reference to some present from the Egyptian to the Israelite monarch is gratuitous. The kings of Israel bought their horses and chariots at a high price (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm" title="And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.">1Kings 10:29</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - (<span class="accented">Entrance of the bridegroom.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.</span> There can be no reasonable doubt that these words are put into the mouth of the king. The "steed" is in the feminine (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>); some would point the word with the plural vowels, that is, "to my horses," or a "body of horses." There is no necessity for that. The reference to a particular very lovely mare is more apt and pointed. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a> we read in the LXX. Version of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, which Solomon had for his chariots - fourteen hundred war chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. The Pharaoh chariots were those which the king had imported from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-28.htm">2 Chronicles 9:28</a>). It may be that the reference is to the splendid decoration of the trappings. Delitzsch very rightly sees in such a figure a confirmation of the view that Solomon himself was the author. The horses from Egypt were famed at that time as those of Arabia became afterwards. The names both of horses and chariots in the Egyptian language were borrowed from the Semitic, as they were probably first imported into Egypt by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings. Other examples of the same comparison are found in poetry, as in Horace, Anacreon, and Theocritus. In the last ('Idyl.,' 18:30, 31) occur the following lines, rendered into English verse: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"As towers the cypress 'mid the garden's bloom,<br />As in the chariot proud Thessalian steed,<br />Thus graceful, rose-complexioned Helen moves."</span> The idea is that of stately beauty and graceful movements. The old commentators see the Divine love of espousals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>), as in the wilderness of the Exodus, and afterwards in the wilderness of the world. The Bible is full of the expression of Divine tenderness and regard for man. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-17 The Bridegroom gives high praises of his spouse. In the sight of Christ believers are the excellent of the earth, fitted to be instruments for promoting his glory. The spiritual gifts and graces which Christ bestows on every true believer, are described by the ornaments then in use, ver. 10,11. The graces of the saints are many, but there is dependence upon each other. He who is the Author, will be the Finisher of the good work. The grace received from Christ's fulness, springs forth into lively exercises of faith, affection, and gratitude. Yet Christ, not his gifts, is most precious to them. The word translated camphire, signifies atonement or propitiation. Christ is dear to all believers, because he is the propitiation for their sins. No pretender must have his place in the soul. They resolved to lodge him in their hearts all the night; during the continuance of the troubles of life. Christ takes delight in the good work which his grace has wrought on the souls of believers. This should engage all who are made holy, to be very thankful for that grace which has made those fair, who by nature were deformed. The spouse (the believer) has a humble, modest eye, discovering simplicity and godly sincerity; eyes enlightened and guided by the Holy Spirit, that blessed Dove. The church expresses her value for Christ. Thou art the great Original, but I am but a faint and imperfect copy. Many are fair to look at, yet their temper renders them unpleasant: but Christ is fair, yet pleasant. The believer, ver. 16, speaks with praise of those holy ordinances in which true believers have fellowship with Christ. Whether the believer is in the courts of the Lord, or in retirement; whether following his daily labours, or confined on the bed of sickness, or even in a dungeon, a sense of the Divine presence will turn the place into a paradise. Thus the soul, daily having fellowship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, enjoys a lively hope of an incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance above.</body></html>
