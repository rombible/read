It should be divided into three clauses, not into two only, as in the Authorised Version: "Because of their odour (or, with regard to their fragrance) thy ointments (are) sweet." There is no authority for taking <span class= "ital">riach = </span>sense of smell, or we should naturally translate "to the smell thy ointments are sweet." The rendering of the next clause, "thy name is (like) oil poured forth," is to be preferred, though it necessitates making either <span class= "ital">shemen </span>= oil, or <span class= "ital">shem = </span>name, feminine, for which there is no example, since the alternative, which takes <span class= "ital">t-rak </span>= poured forth, second masculine instead of third feminine, is harsh: "Thou art poured forth like oil with regard to thy name." The image is an obvious one (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm" title="A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>). There is a play on words in <span class= "ital">shemen </span>and <span class= "ital">shemka.</span><p><span class= "bld">Virgins</span>.--Heb., <span class= "ital">alamoth</span>;<span class= "ital"> young girls. </span>(See Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-8.htm" title="There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>.) Those who understand Solomon to be the object of the desire expressed in these verses understand by <span class= "ital">alamoth </span>"the ladies of the harem." In the original these three verses plainly form a stanza of five lines<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance; thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do the virgins love thee.</span> There is some slight difference among critics as to the rendering of this verse, but it does not affect the meaning. Lovely and delightful thou art. As thy perfumes are so precious, so is thy name; the more it is spread, the more delight is found in it. The idea is that the person is the sweetest, and that his communications are elevating and inspiring. The "virgins" may be taken generally, "Those who are full of the sensibility of youth appreciate thy attractions." The word <span class="accented">almah</span> is much disputed about, but the meaning is simply that of "young woman," whether virgin or married. "Thou art the delight of all the young." Mason Good renders the verse - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Rich thy perfumes; but richer far than they<br />The countless charms that round thy person play;<br />Thy name alone, more fragrant than the rose,<br />Glads every maid, where'er its fragrance flows."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:2-6 The church, or rather the believer, speaks here in the character of the spouse of the King, the Messiah. The kisses of his mouth mean those assurances of pardon with which believers are favoured, filling them with peace and joy in believing, and causing them to abound in hope by the power of the Holy Ghost. Gracious souls take most pleasure in loving Christ, and being loved of him. Christ's love is more valuable and desirable than the best this world can give. The name of Christ is not now like ointment sealed up, but like ointment poured forth; which denotes the freeness and fulness of the setting forth of his grace by the gospel. Those whom he has redeemed and sanctified, are here the virgins that love Jesus Christ, and follow him whithersoever he goes, Re 14:4. They entreat him to draw them by the quickening influences of his Spirit. The more clearly we discern Christ's glory, the more sensible shall we be that we are unable to follow him suitably, and at the same time be more desirous of doing it. Observe the speedy answer given to this prayer. Those who wait at Wisdom's gate, shall be led into truth and comfort. And being brought into this chamber, our griefs will vanish. We have no joy but in Christ, and for this we are indebted to him. We will remember to give thanks for thy love; it shall make more lasting impressions upon us than any thing in this world. Nor is any love acceptable to Christ but love in sincerity, Eph 6:24. The daughters of Jerusalem may mean professors not yet established in the faith. The spouse was black as the tents of the wandering Arabs, but comely as the magnificent curtains in the palaces of Solomon. The believer is black, as being defiled and sinful by nature, but comely, as renewed by Divine grace to the holy image of God. He is still deformed with remains of sin, but comely as accepted in Christ. He is often base and contemptible in the esteem of men, but excellent in the sight of God. The blackness was owing to the hard usage that had been suffered. The children of the church, her mother, but not of God, her Father, were angry with her. They had made her suffer hardships, which caused her to neglect the care of her soul. Thus, under the emblem of a poor female, made the chosen partner of a prince, we are led to consider the circumstances in which the love of Christ is accustomed to find its objects. They were wretched slaves of sin, in toil, or in sorrow, weary and heavy laden, but how great the change when the love of Christ is manifested to their souls!</body></html>
