The beams of our house are cedars, and our rafters are firs. I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley.</span> We take these three verses together as being, in all probability, the address of the bride to her royal husband. This was the view taken by the Masoretic editors and preserved in our present pointing of the Hebrew, as we see in the masculine form of the first word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, which replies to the feminine form in ver. 15, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span>. The seventeenth verse is apparently abrupt. Why should the bride pass so suddenly from the general address of affection, "Thou art fair, thou art pleasant," to a particular description of a rural scene? The explanation suggested by some of the critics is not farfetched, that Solomon whispers to her that she shall go back with him to her country life if she pleases, or she reminds him of his promise made at some other time. Undoubtedly the point of Shulamith's response lies in ch. 2:1, "I am not at ease in this palatial splendour; I am by nature a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley. Take me to the green couch, and let me lie under the cedars and the firs." The couch is the divan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>), from a root "to cover over" (like "canopy" in Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, so called from its protecting the person under it from the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, or "gnats). It is not that the nuptial bed is particularly intended, or even the bridal bower, but the home itself as a bowery resting place. "Our home is a sweet country home; take me, there, beloved one." The word "green" is very suggestive in the Hebrew. It is said to "combine in itself the ideas of softness and juicy freshness, perhaps of bending and elasticity, of looseness and thus of overhanging ramification, like weeping willow." <span class="accented">Beams</span>, from a root "to meet," "to lay crosswise," "to hold together." But the meaning depends upon the idea of the whole description. Some would render "fretted ceilings," or "galleries;" but Dr. Ginsburg gives it, "our bower is of cedar arches," which excludes the idea of a formal structure made of cedar beams. The same meaning is conveyed in the last clause, "our rafters are firs." The word rendered "rafters" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;</span>) literally signifies "a place upon which one runs" (like <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, a "street"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a charming or pleasant spot. The <span class="accented">beroth</span> is the cypress tree, an Aramaic word, or one used in the north of Palestine. The meaning is, "our pleasant retreat is cypresses" - is beautiful and fragrant with the cypress tree. Delitzsch, however, and others would take it differently as describing the panels or hollows of a wainscoted ceiling, like <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="accented">lacunae</span>, <span class="accented">lacunaria</span>, and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>: Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>: Jerome, <span class="accented">laquearii</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>). But the concluding words would then be unfitting. The bride is not describing a splendid palace, but a country home. "I am a tender maiden," she says, "who has been brought up in retirement; take me to a forest palace and to the green, fragrant surroundings, where the meadow flower, the valley lily will be happy." We are so accustomed to the rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-1.htm">Song of Solomon 2:1</a>, which our Revised Version has adopted from the Authorized, that it would be wrong to destroy the effect which it borrows from long familiarity unless it were absolutely necessary. The word <span class="accented">chavatseleth</span>, however, has been differently translated; it is literally any wild flower - rose, saffron crocus (<span class="accented">Colchieum autumnale</span>), tulip, narcissus, lily. The crocus is, perhaps, nearest . to the meaning, as the name is probably derived from a root "to form bulbs" or bulbous knolls. It occurs only once again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>, where it is rendered "rose" in the Authorized Version; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">flos</span>. Some derive it from the root <span class="accented">chavaz</span>, "to be bright," with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> as termination. <span class="accented">Sharon</span> may be here a general denomination of the open field or plain, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, "to be straight, plain." There was a district called Sharon on the coast from Joppa to Caesarea. There was another Sharon beyond the Jordan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>). According to Eusebius and Jerome, there was yet another, between Tabor and Tiberias, and this, as being in the north, may be referred to. Aquila renders "a rosebud of Sharon." The lily (<span class="accented">shoshannah</span>) is only found as here in the feminine form in the Apocrypha. The red and white lily were both known. Some would derive the word from the numeral (<span class="accented">shesh</span>) "six," because the liliaceae are six-leaved, while the rosaceae are five-leaved; but it is probably akin to <span class="accented">shesh</span>, "byssus," <span class="accented">shayish</span>, "white marbles" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>, "He shall bloom as a lily"). Our Lord's reference to "the lilies of the field" reminds us that they were in Palestine both very beautiful and very abundant. Zockler thinks it is not the strongly scented white lily (<span class="accented">Lilium candidam</span>) to which reference is made, but the red lily (<span class="accented">Lilium rubens</span>); but either will convey the same idea of a flower of the field which is meant. "My beauty is the beauty of nature - artless and pure." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-17 The Bridegroom gives high praises of his spouse. In the sight of Christ believers are the excellent of the earth, fitted to be instruments for promoting his glory. The spiritual gifts and graces which Christ bestows on every true believer, are described by the ornaments then in use, ver. 10,11. The graces of the saints are many, but there is dependence upon each other. He who is the Author, will be the Finisher of the good work. The grace received from Christ's fulness, springs forth into lively exercises of faith, affection, and gratitude. Yet Christ, not his gifts, is most precious to them. The word translated camphire, signifies atonement or propitiation. Christ is dear to all believers, because he is the propitiation for their sins. No pretender must have his place in the soul. They resolved to lodge him in their hearts all the night; during the continuance of the troubles of life. Christ takes delight in the good work which his grace has wrought on the souls of believers. This should engage all who are made holy, to be very thankful for that grace which has made those fair, who by nature were deformed. The spouse (the believer) has a humble, modest eye, discovering simplicity and godly sincerity; eyes enlightened and guided by the Holy Spirit, that blessed Dove. The church expresses her value for Christ. Thou art the great Original, but I am but a faint and imperfect copy. Many are fair to look at, yet their temper renders them unpleasant: but Christ is fair, yet pleasant. The believer, ver. 16, speaks with praise of those holy ordinances in which true believers have fellowship with Christ. Whether the believer is in the courts of the Lord, or in retirement; whether following his daily labours, or confined on the bed of sickness, or even in a dungeon, a sense of the Divine presence will turn the place into a paradise. Thus the soul, daily having fellowship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, enjoys a lively hope of an incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance above.</body></html>
