We understand it as a repetition, in another form, of the protestation of love made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/1-1.htm" title="The song of songs, which is Solomon's.">Song of Solomon 1:1-3</a>. Like them, it forms a stanza of five lines. The clause, "the king hath brought," &c, is--in accordance with a common Hebrew idiom, where an hypothesis is expressed by a simple perfect or future without a particle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-29.htm" title="See you a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.">Proverbs 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-16.htm" title="Have you found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled therewith, and vomit it.">Proverbs 25:16</a>)--to be understood, "Even should the king have brought me into his chambers, yet our transport and our joys are for <span class= "ital">thee </span>alone; even then we would recall thy caresses, those caresses which are sweeter than wine."<p><span class= "bld">The upright love thee.</span>--Marg., <span class= "ital">they love thee uprightly; </span>Heb., <span class= "ital">meysharim, </span>used in other places either (1) in the abstract, "righteousness," &c, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-2.htm" title="Let my sentence come forth from your presence; let your eyes behold the things that are equal.">Psalm 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-4.htm" title="The king's strength also loves judgment; you do establish equity, you execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob.">Psalm 99:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-6.htm" title="Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.">Proverbs 8:6</a> (so LXX. here); or (2) adverbially, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm" title="Yes, in heart you work wickedness; you weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm" title="The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.">Psalm 75:3</a> (and <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-9.htm" title="And the roof of your mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goes down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.">Song of Solomon 7:9</a> below; but there the <span class= "ital">Lamed </span>prefixed fixes the adverbial use). The Authorised Version follows the Vulg., <span class= "ital">Recti diligunt te, </span>and is to be preferred, as bringing the clause into parallelism with the concluding clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-3.htm" title="Because of the smell of your good ointments your name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love you.">Song of Solomon 1:3</a> : "Thou who hast won the love of all maidens by thy personal attractions, hast gained that of the sincere and upright ones by thy character and thy great name."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will make mention of thy love more than of wine: rightly do they love thee.</span> This is best taken as all spoken by the bride. It is the language of the purest affection and adoring admiration. "I drew them," God says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a>), "with cords of a man, with bands of love." "The Lord appeared of old unto me," says Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>), "saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee." In the same sense the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is used by our Lord himself of the Father <span class="accented">drawing</span> to the Son, and of the Son, uplifted on the cross, "drawing" all men unto him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>). If the spiritual meaning of the whole poem is admitted, such language is quite natural. The king's chambers are the king's own rooms in the palace, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his sleeping, rooms and sitting rooms - the <span class="accented">penetralia regis.</span> We may take the preterite as equivalent to the present; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "The king is bringing me into closest fellowship with himself, not merely as a member of his household, but as his chosen bride." The concluding words have caused much discussion. The meaning, however, is the same whether we say, "The upright love thee," or "Thou art rightly loved." The intention is to set forth the object of love as perfect. The plural, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, is used to signify the abstract of the word, thought, or act; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "righteous," for "rightly" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>); but the best critics think it could not be the abstract for the concrete plural, as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Recti diligunt re.</span> The same use of the word is seen in eh. 7:9, "The best wine that teeth down <span class="accented">smoothly</span> for my beloved" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-31.htm">Proverbs 23:31</a>). Before going further in the song, it is well to observe how chaste, pure, and delicate is the language of love; and yet, as Delitzsch has pointed out, there is a mystical, cloudy brightness. We seem to be in the region of the ideal. It is not a mere love song, though it may have been the commemoration of an actual past. The Eastern form of the words may be less suited to our taste than it would be to those who first embraced Christianity, and to the nineteenth century than to the first; but the loving rapture of the Church in fellowship with the Saviour is certainly seeking a more vivid expression in song, and there are many of the most simple-minded and devoted Christians whose joy in Christ pours itself out freely in strains not much less fervid and almost as sensuous as anything to be found in Solomon's Song. Some are beginning to remonstrate against this freedom of devotional language, but the instinct of the Church seems to justify it as the demand of the heart under the influence of the Word of God itself. Perhaps there is a state of religious feeling coming into the experience of Christians which will remove the veil from such a book as the Song of Songs, and we shall yet find that its language is needful and is not extravagant. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:2-6 The church, or rather the believer, speaks here in the character of the spouse of the King, the Messiah. The kisses of his mouth mean those assurances of pardon with which believers are favoured, filling them with peace and joy in believing, and causing them to abound in hope by the power of the Holy Ghost. Gracious souls take most pleasure in loving Christ, and being loved of him. Christ's love is more valuable and desirable than the best this world can give. The name of Christ is not now like ointment sealed up, but like ointment poured forth; which denotes the freeness and fulness of the setting forth of his grace by the gospel. Those whom he has redeemed and sanctified, are here the virgins that love Jesus Christ, and follow him whithersoever he goes, Re 14:4. They entreat him to draw them by the quickening influences of his Spirit. The more clearly we discern Christ's glory, the more sensible shall we be that we are unable to follow him suitably, and at the same time be more desirous of doing it. Observe the speedy answer given to this prayer. Those who wait at Wisdom's gate, shall be led into truth and comfort. And being brought into this chamber, our griefs will vanish. We have no joy but in Christ, and for this we are indebted to him. We will remember to give thanks for thy love; it shall make more lasting impressions upon us than any thing in this world. Nor is any love acceptable to Christ but love in sincerity, Eph 6:24. The daughters of Jerusalem may mean professors not yet established in the faith. The spouse was black as the tents of the wandering Arabs, but comely as the magnificent curtains in the palaces of Solomon. The believer is black, as being defiled and sinful by nature, but comely, as renewed by Divine grace to the holy image of God. He is still deformed with remains of sin, but comely as accepted in Christ. He is often base and contemptible in the esteem of men, but excellent in the sight of God. The blackness was owing to the hard usage that had been suffered. The children of the church, her mother, but not of God, her Father, were angry with her. They had made her suffer hardships, which caused her to neglect the care of her soul. Thus, under the emblem of a poor female, made the chosen partner of a prince, we are led to consider the circumstances in which the love of Christ is accustomed to find its objects. They were wretched slaves of sin, in toil, or in sorrow, weary and heavy laden, but how great the change when the love of Christ is manifested to their souls!</body></html>
