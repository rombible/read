But when in Hebrew a compound idea is to be expressed definitely, the article is prefixed to the word in the genitive. So here not merely <span class= "ital">"a </span>song of songs" (comp. holy of holies), <span class= "ital">i.e., "</span>a very excellent song," but "<span class= "ital">The </span>song of songs," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the most excellent or surpassing song. For the question of authorship and date of poem, see <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>I.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The song of songs, which is Solomon's.</span> This is certainly the title of the book which follows, although in our present Hebrew Bible it is the first verse of the book preceded by the shorter form, 'The Song of Songs.' The Septuagint has simply the title <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, So that our English title in the Authorized Version, 'The Song of Solomon,' has no ancient authority. It is well altered in the Revised Version to 'The Song of Songs.' The word "song" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) does not necessarily convey the meaning. composed to be sung to music. If the performance of the words were chiefly in view, the word would have been <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">carmen</span>, "lyric poem," "hymn," or "ode." The Greek <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the Latin of the Vulgate<span class="accented">, Canticum canticorum</span>, accord with the Hebrew in representing the work as taking a high place either in the esteem of the Church or, on account of the subject, in the esteem of the writer. Luther expresses the same idea in the title he attaches to it, 'Das Hohelied,' that is, the chief or finest of songs. The reference may be to the excellence of the literary form, but probably that which suggested the title was the supreme beauty of the love which prompted the songs. The title may be regarded as applied to the whole book, or to the first portion of it giving the name to the whole. If it be a collection of separate songs strung together, as some think) by mere resemblance in style and subject, then the words, "which is Solomon's" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) apply to the first song alone. But the unity which is clearly to be traced through the book to the end makes it probable that the title is meant to ascribe the work to the authorship of Solomon. This is the opinion of the majority of critics. It must have come either from the wise king himself, or from some one of his contemporaries or immediate successors. The preposition is the <span class="accented">lamedh auctoris.</span> If the meaning were "referring to," another preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) would have been employed. It has been remarked by Delitzsch that the absence of any description of Solomon as "King of Israel" or "son of David," as in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, confirms the view that Solomon himself was the sole author. Some have argued against the authenticity of the title on the ground that the longer form of the relative, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, is used in it, whereas in the book itself the shorter form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;</span>, is found, but no dependence, can be placed on that argument regarded by itself, for the same writer employs both forms, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jeremiah, who uses the longer form in his prophecies and the shorter in Lamentations. The shorter form is, in fact, the elder, being Old Canaanitish or Phoenician, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which is a lengthened form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and afterwards became <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>. One writer, however Fleischer), holds that the relative pronoun as a substantive origin, and compares it with the Arabic <span class="accented">ithe</span> and the Assyrian <span class="accented">asar</span>, meaning "track" or "place," like the German <span class="accented">welcher</span>, which comes from <span class="accented">wo.</span> But whether this be so or not, it is certainly unsafe to date any book by the form found in it of the, relative pronoun. We know that in poetry the abbreviated form is common. It was probably a North Palestine provincialism, as we see in the Book of Kings. It became common in prose writings after the Captivity because of the degradation of Hebrew, but it was not unknown before that time either in prose or poetry. With regard to the exact description of the poetic form of the Song of Songs, the difference among critics is considerable, but the question is scarcely worth discussing. There undoubtedly is unity of conception in the songs which are brought together, but it cannot be of importance to prove that there is dramatic unity strictly speaking; there is no dramatic procedure, nor can we suppose that there is any ultimate aim at dramatic representation. But the Exposition which follows will suffice to show that there are facts of history in the background of the poem; if the suggestions of the language and scenery be followed, the facts are very beautiful and even romantic - the love of the great king for one of his own subjects, a lovely northern maiden, whose simplicity and purity of character are a great attraction and lend much force to the religious sentiment of the song. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-12.htm">1 Kings 5:12</a> we read that "the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him." That divinely inspired wisdom enabled him, notwithstanding his own personal errors, to idealize and sanctify the lovely episode of his lifo which lies at the foundation of his poem. And the Church of God in every age has appreciated, more or less widely, the inspiration, both of matter and of form, which breathed in it. We are told that Solomon composed one thousand and five songs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-32.htm">1 Kings 4:32</a>); whether this is a part of that collection or not we cannot certainly say, but that it is a mere <span class="accented">fasciculus</span>, or collection of separate songs, strung together by their general erotic character, is what we cannot believe. No doubt, as Dr. Mason Good has observed, the Arabian poets were accustomed to arrange their poems in what they compared to a string of pearls, but we can scarcely carry such a fact into the Bible, and deal with sacred books as mere literary remains. There must be a deep religious meaning in such language, and it is in accordance with Eastern usage that amatory songs should be so employed. What the meaning is we must persistently ask, and however much has been wrongly said in the past, while we believe in the Divine authority of the Old Testament we must not renounce the endeavour to find the Song of Songs worthy of its title and its place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1 This is the Song of songs, excellent above any others, for it is wholly taken up with describing the excellences of Christ, and the love between him and his redeemed people.</body></html>
