For why should I be . . .</span>?--The marginal reading, <span class= "ital">that is veiled, </span>follows the LXX. in rendering the Hebrew literally. But it has been found somewhat difficult to assign a meaning to a literal translation. The su<span class= "ital">ggestions=unknown </span>(Ewald), <span class= "ital">veiled as a harlot </span>(Delitzsch, &c; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-15.htm" title="When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.">Genesis 38:15</a>), <span class= "ital">fainting </span>(Gesenius), seem all wide of the mark, since the question only refers to the danger of missing her beloved through ignorance of his whereabouts. A transposition of two letters would give a word with a sense required = <span class= "ital">erring, wandering about, </span>a sense, indeed, which old Rabbinical commentators gave to this word itself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-16.htm" title="What have you here? and whom have you here, that you have hewed you out a sepulcher here, as he that hews him out a sepulcher on high, and that engraves an habitation for himself in a rock?">Isaiah 22:16</a> (Authorised Version, <span class= "ital">cover</span>); and probably the idea involved is the obvious one that a person with the head muffled up would not find her way easily, as we might say, "Why should I go about blindfold?"<p>The Rabbinical interpretation of this verse is a good instance of the fanciful treatment the book has received: "When the time came for Moses to depart, he said to the Lord, 'It is revealed to me that this people will sin and go into captivity; show me how they shall be governed and dwell among the nations whose decrees <span class= "ital">are oppressive as the heat; </span>and wherefore is it they shall wander among the flocks of Esau and Ishmael, who make <span class= "ital">them idols equal to thee as thy companions?'"</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest thy flock, where thou makest it to rest at noon: for why should I he as one that is veiled beside the flock of thy companions?</span> These words carry on the associations suggested by the previous verse. The bride is longing for the bridegroom; but she cannot think of him yet in any other light than as a companion of her simple country life - he is a shepherd, and she a shepherdess. "Take me into closer fellowship with thyself; let me not remain still only one amongst the many." Perhaps there is intended to be an allusion to the common metaphor - the king as the shepherd and the people as his flock; but the uppermost thought of the bride is separation unto her husband. The soul which longs for the enjoyment of fellowship with God desires to be carried away out of all distractions, out of all restraints, lifted above reserve and above doubt into the closest and most loving union. The idea of the veil may be either the veil of mourning or the veil of modesty and reserve. Probably the latter is the true reference. The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. There is some difference of opinion among critics. Ewald thinks it refers to strangeness - "like one unknown," and therefore veiled; Gesenius says, "one fainting;" others connect the word with the root "to <span class="accented">roam</span>," "to <span class="accented">wander"</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-17.htm">Isaiah 22:17</a>), which is confirmed by Symmachus, the Vulgate, the Syriac, the Chaldee, Jerome, Venetian, and Luther. The simplest explanation is that the bride compares herself, in her absence from her lord, among the ladies of the court, to a veiled woman travelling beside the flocks of the shepherds, seeking her friend, but not yet brought to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7,8 Observe the title given to Christ, O Thou whom my soul loveth. Those that do so, may come to him boldly, and may humbly plead with him. Is it with God's people a noon-time of outward troubles, inward conflicts? Christ has rest for them. Those whose souls love Jesus Christ, earnestly desire to share in the privileges of his flock. Turning aside from Christ is what gracious souls dread more than anything else. God is ready to answer prayer. Follow the track, ask for the good old way, observe the footsteps of the flock, look what has been the practice of godly people. Sit under the direction of good ministers; beside the tents of the under shepherds. Bring thy charge with thee, they shall all be welcome. It will be the earnest desire and prayer of the Christian, that God would so direct him in his worldly business, and so order his situation and employment, that he may have his Lord and Saviour always before him.</body></html>
