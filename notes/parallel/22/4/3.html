"The pomegranate brings to my mind the blushes of my beloved, when her cheeks are covered with a modest resentment" (Persian Ode, quoted by Ginsburg from Sir Wm. Jones). For the pomegranate see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-34.htm" title="A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, on the hem of the robe round about.">Exodus 28:34</a>.

"Her cheeks like apples which the sun hath rudded" (Spenser).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy mouth is comely; thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.</span> <span class="accented">Scarlet</span>; that is, shining, glistening red colour. <span class="accented">Thy mouth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span>). Thy mouth as speaking. So the LXX., Jerome, and Venetian, "thy speech," <span class="accented">eloquium</span>, conversation. But this is questioned, as it should then be <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span>. The word <span class="accented">midhbar</span> undoubtedly means "the mouth," from <span class="accented">davar</span>, "to speak," with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> preformative, as the name of the instrument. It is the preterite for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span>, but perhaps as referring specially to speech. <span class="accented">Thy temples</span>; Latin <span class="accented">tempora</span>, from the adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, "weak," meaning the thin, piece of skull on each side of the eyes, like the German <span class="accented">schlafe</span>, from <span class="accented">schlaff</span>, "slack." The inside of the pomegranate is of a red colour mixed and tempered with the ruby colour. Ginsburg, however, thinks that the cheeks are intended, and that the comparison is with the outside of the pomegranate, in which the vermilion colour is mingled with brown, and resembles the round cheek; but then why say, "<span class="accented">piece</span> of a pomegranate"? <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, from the root "to cut fruit" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4.htm">1 Kings 4</a>:39), certainly must refer to the cut fruit and the appearance of the inside. The meaning may be a segment, that is, so as to represent the roundness of the cheek. Possibly the reference may be to blushes on the bride's cheek, or to ornaments which appeared through the veil. We can scarcely expect to make out every particular in an Eastern description. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 If each of these comparisons has a meaning applicable to the graces of the church, or of the faithful Christian, they are not clearly known; and great mistakes are made by fanciful guesses. The mountain of myrrh appears to mean the mountain Moriah, on which the temple was built, where the incense was burned, and the people worshipped the Lord. This was his residence till the shadows of the law given to Moses were dispersed by the breaking of the gospel day, and the rising of the Sun of righteousness. And though, in respect of his human nature, Christ is absent from his church on earth, and will continue to be so till the heavenly day break, yet he is spiritually present in his ordinances, and with his people. How fair and comely are believers, when justified in Christ's righteousness, and adorned with spiritual graces! when their thoughts, words, and deeds, though imperfect, are pure, manifesting a heart nourished by the gospel!</body></html>
