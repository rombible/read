The literal, "thou hast <span class= "ital">hearted </span>(<span class= "ital">libabtini</span>) me," if we can so say, may mean either; the language of love would approve either <span class= "ital">stolen my heart </span>or <span class= "ital">given me thine. </span>But the reference to "chain"--<span class= "ital">anak </span>(a form occurring also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm" title="And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.">Judges 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm" title="For they shall be an ornament of grace to your head, and chains about your neck.">Proverbs 1:9</a>) seems to confirm the rendering of the Authorised Version. His heart has been caught, the poet playfully says, by the neck-chain. Tennyson's<p>"Thy rose lips and full-blown eyes<p>Take the heart from out my breast,"<p>gives the feeling of the passage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</span> The bridegroom still continues his address of love, which we must not, of course, press too closely, though it is noticeable that the language becomes somewhat more sober in tone, as though the writer were conscious of the higher application to which it would be put. Some translators take the first clause as though the word "ravished" should be rendered "emboldened." Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, literally, "heartened," may mean, as in Aramaic, "make courageous." Love in the beginning overpowers, <span class="accented">unhearts</span>, but the general idea must be that of "smitten" or "captured." So the LXX., Venetian, and Jerome, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">vulnerasti cor meum</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>). <span class="accented">My sister, my bride</span>, is, of course, the same as "my sisterly bride," a step beyond "my betrothed." Gesenius thinks that "one of thine eyes" should be "one look of thine;" but may it not refer to the eye appearing through the veil, as again one chain of the neck may glitter and attract all the more that the whole ornamentation did not appear in view? If but a portion of her beauty so overpowers, what will be the effect of the whole blaze of her perfection? As the Church advances in her likeness to her Lord, she becomes more and more the object of his delight, and as the soul receives more and more grace, so is her fellowship with Christ more and more assured and joyful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-15 Observe the gracious call Christ gives to the church. It is, 1. A precept; so this is Christ's call to his church to come off from the world. These hills seem pleasant, but there are in them lions' dens; they are mountains of the leopards. 2. As a promise; many shall be brought as members of the church, from every point. The church shall be delivered from her persecutors in due time, though now she dwells among lions, Ps 57:4. Christ's heart is upon his church; his treasure is therein; and he delights in the affection she has for him; its working in the heart, and its works in the life. The odours wherewith the spouse is perfumed, are as the gifts and graces of the Spirit. Love and obedience to God are more pleasing to Christ than sacrifice or incense. Christ having put upon his spouse the white raiment of his own righteousness, and the righteousness of saints, and perfumed it with holy joy and comfort, he is well pleased with it. And Christ walks in his garden unseen. A hedge of protection is made around, which all the powers of darkness cannot break through. The souls of believers are as gardens enclosed, where is a well of living water, Joh 4:14; 7:38, the influences of the Holy Spirit. The world knows not these wells of salvation, nor can any opposer corrupt this fountain. Saints in the church, and graces in the saints, are fitly compared to fruits and spices. They are planted, and do not grow of themselves. They are precious; they are the blessings of this earth. They will be kept to good purpose when flowers are withered. Grace, when ended in glory, will last for ever. Christ is the source which makes these gardens fruitful; even a well of living waters.</body></html>
