But this may either be "to produce twins," as in the text, or "to make pairs," or "to occur in pairs," a rendering which gives far better sense. The perfect and regular rows of teeth are exactly paired, upper to lower, like the sheep coming two and two from the washing, not one being bereaved of its fellow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn, which are come up from the washing; whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them.</span> The simile is very apt and beautiful Thy teeth are perfectly smooth, regular, and white; the upper set corresponding exactly to the lower set, like twin births in which there is no break (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-6.htm">Song of Solomon 6:6</a>). The moisture of the <span class="accented">saliva dentium</span>, heightening the glance of the teeth, is frequently mentioned in love songs. The whiteness of wool is often used as a comparison (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>; Book of Enoch 46:1). Some think that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. should not be rendered "newly shorn," but "periodically shorn" (see Ginsburg) - a poetical epithet for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The newly shorn would be washed first, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, "to be double,....to be pairs," in the hiph. is "to make double," "to make pairs," "to appear paired." Perhaps the reference is to the sheep being washed in pairs, and going up side by side from the water. This would seem almost more exact than the idea of twin lambs, because the difference in size between the ewe and the lamb would suggest irregularity. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, "deprived," "bereaved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>), may point merely to the loneliness of the single sheep going up by itself, suggesting one tooth without its fellow. Ginsburg says, "all of which are paired." Each keeps to its mate as they come up from the pool. This is a decided improvement on the Authorized Version. But the figure is clear with either rendering, and is very striking and suggestive of the pleasant country life to which the bride was accustomed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 If each of these comparisons has a meaning applicable to the graces of the church, or of the faithful Christian, they are not clearly known; and great mistakes are made by fanciful guesses. The mountain of myrrh appears to mean the mountain Moriah, on which the temple was built, where the incense was burned, and the people worshipped the Lord. This was his residence till the shadows of the law given to Moses were dispersed by the breaking of the gospel day, and the rising of the Sun of righteousness. And though, in respect of his human nature, Christ is absent from his church on earth, and will continue to be so till the heavenly day break, yet he is spiritually present in his ordinances, and with his people. How fair and comely are believers, when justified in Christ's righteousness, and adorned with spiritual graces! when their thoughts, words, and deeds, though imperfect, are pure, manifesting a heart nourished by the gospel!</body></html>
