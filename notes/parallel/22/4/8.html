so Vulg. and Luther, reading <span class= "ital">athi, </span>imperative of <span class= "ital">athah, </span>instead of <span class= "ital">itti =</span> <span class= "ital">with me, </span>or more properly, <span class= "ital">as regards me. </span>The reading involved only a difference of vowel points, and is to be preferred. We have here another reminiscence of the obstacles which had attended the union of the pair under another figure. The course of true love, which never yet, in East or West, ran smooth, is beset here by tremendous difficulties, symbolised by the rocks and snows of the range of Lebanon, which shut in the poet's northern home, and the wild beasts that haunted these regions. Like Tennyson's shepherd, he believes that "love is of the valleys," and calls to her to come down to him from her inaccessible heights. The word <span class= "ital">Sh-r </span>translated in English Version <span class= "ital">look, </span>has properly in the LXX. its primitive meaning, <span class= "ital">come. </span>To suppose a literal journey, as some do, to these peaks of the mountain chain one after another, is absurd. They are named as emblems of height and difficulty. <span class= "ital">Shenir </span>(Senir, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm" title="And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelled in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baalhermon and Senir, and to mount Hermon.">1Chronicles 5:23</a>) is one of the peaks of Hermon. <span class= "ital">Amana </span>has been conjectured to be a name for the district of Anti-Libanus in which the Abana (<span class= "ital">Barada</span>) has its source, but nothing is certain about it. The appellative <span class= "ital">spouse </span>first occurs in this verse. In Hebrew it is <span class= "ital">khallah, </span>and is translated in the Authorised Version either "daughter-in-law," or "bride," or "spouse," according as the relationship, now made complete by marriage, is regarded from the point of view of the parents of the bridegroom or of himself (<span class= "ital">e.g., daughter-in-law, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-11.htm" title="Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at your father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brothers did. And Tamar went and dwelled in her father's house.">Genesis 38:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-22.htm" title="You shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, where I bring you to dwell therein, spew you not out.">Leviticus 20:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-6.htm" title="For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.">Micah 7:6</a>, &c; <span class= "ital">bride, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm" title="Lift up your eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, said the LORD, you shall surely clothe you with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on you, as a bride does.">Isaiah 49:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm" title="I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-5.htm" title="For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you: and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.">Isaiah 62:5</a>, &c.). Its use does not by itself prove that the pair were united in wedlock, because in the next verse the word <span class= "ital">sister </span>is joined to <span class= "ital">spouse, </span>and it may, therefore, be only a stronger term of endearment, and in any case, when put into the lover's mouth while describing the difficulties in the way of union, it is <span class= "ital">proleptic</span>; but its presence strongly confirms the impression produced by the whole poem, that it describes over and over again the courtship and marriage of the same couple. For <span class= "ital">lion </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm" title="Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?">Genesis 49:9</a>. The <span class= "ital">leopard </span>was formerly very common in Palestine, as the name <span class= "ital">Bethnimrah, i.e., house of leopards </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-36.htm" title="And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.">Numbers 32:36</a>) shows. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm" title="Why a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goes out there shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.">Jeremiah 5:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-7.htm" title="Therefore I will be to them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:">Hosea 13:7</a>.) Nor is it rare now. "In the forest of Gilead it is still so numerous as to be a pest to the herdsmen" (Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of Bibl., </span>p. 113).<p>The LXX. translate <span class= "ital">amana </span>by <span class= "greekheb">??????</span><span class= "ital">, </span>and this has been turned into an argument for the allegorical treatment of the book. But it is a very common error of the LXX. to translate proper names. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-4.htm" title="You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.">Song of Solomon 6:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</span> This seems to be simply the bridegroom rejoicing over the bride, the meaning being, "Give thyself up to me" - thou art mine; look away from the past, and delight thyself in the future. Delitzsch, however, thinks that the bridegroom seeks the bride to go with him up the steep heights of Lebanon, and to descend with him from thence; for while ascending the mountain one has no view before him, but when descending he has the whole panorama of the surrounding region lying at his feet. It is stretching poetical language too far to take it so literally and topically; there is no necessity to think of either the lover or his beloved as actually on the mountains, the idea is simply that of the mountainous region - Turn thy back upon it, look away from it. This is clearly seen from the fact that the names connected with Lebanon - Amana, Senir, Hermon - could have no reference to the bride's being in them. as they represent Anti-Libanus, separated from Lebanon by the Coelo-Syrian valley, stretching from the Banias northwards to the plain of Hamath (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-12.htm">2 Kings 5:12</a>, where Amana is Abana, overlooking Damascus, now the Basadia). Shenir, or Senir, and Hermon are neighbouring peaks or mountains, or possibly different names for the same (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a> they are mentioned as districts. Hermon is the chief mountain of the range of Anti-Libanus on the northeast border of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-12.htm">Psalm 89:12</a>). The wild beasts abounded in that district, especially lions and panthers. They were found in the clefts and defiles of the rocks. Lions, however, have now altogether disappeared. In the name <span class="accented">Amana</span> some think there is an allusion to truth (<span class="accented">amen</span>) (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-22.htm">Hosea 2:22</a>); but that would be too obscure. The general intention of the passage is simple and plain - Leave the rough places, and come to my palace. The words "with me" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) are taken by the LXX. and Vulgate as though written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, the imperative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to come," as a word of invitation, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;</span>. The use of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, "thou shalt come," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou hast come and be content, renders it improbable that such should be the reading, whereas the preposition with the pronoun is quite in place. The spiritual meaning is not far to seek. The life that we live without Christ is at best a life among the wild, untamed impulses of nature, and in the rough and dangerous places of the world. He invites us to go with him to the place which he has prepared for us. And so the Church will leave its crude thoughts and undeveloped life, and seek, in the love of Christ and in the gifts of his Spirit, a truer reflection of his nature and will (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-16</a>). The Apocalypse is based upon the same idea, the advancement of the kingdom of Christ from the place of lions and panthers to the new Jerusalem, with its perfection of beauty and its eternal peace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-15 Observe the gracious call Christ gives to the church. It is, 1. A precept; so this is Christ's call to his church to come off from the world. These hills seem pleasant, but there are in them lions' dens; they are mountains of the leopards. 2. As a promise; many shall be brought as members of the church, from every point. The church shall be delivered from her persecutors in due time, though now she dwells among lions, Ps 57:4. Christ's heart is upon his church; his treasure is therein; and he delights in the affection she has for him; its working in the heart, and its works in the life. The odours wherewith the spouse is perfumed, are as the gifts and graces of the Spirit. Love and obedience to God are more pleasing to Christ than sacrifice or incense. Christ having put upon his spouse the white raiment of his own righteousness, and the righteousness of saints, and perfumed it with holy joy and comfort, he is well pleased with it. And Christ walks in his garden unseen. A hedge of protection is made around, which all the powers of darkness cannot break through. The souls of believers are as gardens enclosed, where is a well of living water, Joh 4:14; 7:38, the influences of the Holy Spirit. The world knows not these wells of salvation, nor can any opposer corrupt this fountain. Saints in the church, and graces in the saints, are fitly compared to fruits and spices. They are planted, and do not grow of themselves. They are precious; they are the blessings of this earth. They will be kept to good purpose when flowers are withered. Grace, when ended in glory, will last for ever. Christ is the source which makes these gardens fruitful; even a well of living waters.</body></html>
