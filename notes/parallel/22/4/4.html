The structure at the north-west angle, known since the Crusades as the "Tower of David," is Herodian. No clue would be given by the words in the text, "builded for an armoury," even were it certain that this is their right rendering. The LXX. regard the Heb. <span class= "ital">thalpioth </span>as a proper name. Rabbinical authority is in favour of "as a model for architects," but most modern commentators, though differing as to the etymology, agree in giving the sense of the English Version, which the context seems to require. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-11.htm" title="The men of Arvad with your army were on your walls round about, and the Gammadims were in your towers: they hanged their shields on your walls round about; they have made your beauty perfect.">Ezekiel 27:11</a> : "They hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.") The shields and targets made by Solomon for the house in the forest of Lebanon may have suggested this addition to an image which is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-7.htm" title="This your stature is like to a palm tree, and your breasts to clusters of grapes.">Song of Solomon 7:7</a>, and, indeed, is too common to need remark. "Her snowy neck like a marble tower" (Spenser). "Her neck is like a stately tower" (Lodge).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy neck is like the tower of David, builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all the shields of the mighty men.</span> There is an evident change here in the character of the similitudes. The royal bridegroom does not forget to praise the majesty of his bride. The description now suits a royal queen. She is full of dignity and grace in her bearing. The tower referred to was no doubt that which was sometimes called "The tower of the flock" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>), that from which David surveyed the flock of his people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16, 25</a>) - the government building erected on Mount Zion which served as a court of justice. The word <span class="accented">talpiyoth</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;</span>, as if a proper name. Hengstenberg would render it "built for hanging swords," supposing it composed of two words - <span class="accented">tal</span>, from a root "to hang," and <span class="accented">piyoth</span>, "swords." But the word <span class="accented">piyoth</span> does not mean "swords," but the "double edges" of the swords. Kimchi renders. "an erection of sharp-cornered stones." Gesenius takes it from two roots, "to perish" and "to go," that is, <span class="accented">exitialibus armis</span>, which is very doubtful. Ewald's explanation seems the best, "built for close troops, so that many hundreds or thousands find room therein," taking it from a root, connected with the Arabic, meaning, "to wrap together." Delitzsch, however, observes that both in Aramaic and Talmudic Hebrew words occur, like this, in the sense of "enclosure," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> joining together, one working into the other, so that it may be taken as meaning, "in ranks together." This view is supported by Doderlein, Meier, Aquila, Jerome, Vulgate (<span class="accented">propugnacula</span>), and Venetian (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). If this be accepted, it may mean "terraced," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> built in stories one above another. This would convey the appearance of the tall, straight neck better than any. Surrounded with ornaments, the neck would so appear. There is another suggestion, supported by Ginsburg and taken from Rashi and Rashbun, Jewish writers, that the word is a contraction for a noun meaning "instruction," and means "the model tower" - the tower built for an architect's model. It would be rendered, "built for the builder's model." The meaning "armoury" takes it as composed of two words, <span class="accented">tael</span>," a hill," and <span class="accented">piyoth</span>," swords." It was decorated with a thousand shields, which was a customary adornment of towers and castles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>). <span class="accented">All the</span> <span class="accented">shields of heroes.</span> We can scarcely doubt the reference in such words to the time of Solomon, and therefore to his authorship, as the allusion to heroes, or mighty men of valour, would be customary soon after the time of David. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 If each of these comparisons has a meaning applicable to the graces of the church, or of the faithful Christian, they are not clearly known; and great mistakes are made by fanciful guesses. The mountain of myrrh appears to mean the mountain Moriah, on which the temple was built, where the incense was burned, and the people worshipped the Lord. This was his residence till the shadows of the law given to Moses were dispersed by the breaking of the gospel day, and the rising of the Sun of righteousness. And though, in respect of his human nature, Christ is absent from his church on earth, and will continue to be so till the heavenly day break, yet he is spiritually present in his ordinances, and with his people. How fair and comely are believers, when justified in Christ's righteousness, and adorned with spiritual graces! when their thoughts, words, and deeds, though imperfect, are pure, manifesting a heart nourished by the gospel!</body></html>
