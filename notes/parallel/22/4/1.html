The derivation, and the existence of cognate Arabic words, leave no doubt that it means <span class= "ital">veil. </span>So, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-2.htm" title="Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover your locks, make bore the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.">Isaiah 47:2</a>, the LXX. understood it, though here they have given the strange and meaningless translation, "out of thy silence," which the Vulg. has still further mystified into "from that which lies hid within," a rendering which has been a fruitful source of moral allusion to the more hidden beauties of the soul. If the veil was worn in ancient times in Palestine, as by Eastern ladies now, covering the lower part of the face, but allowing the eyes to be seen, the description is very appropriate.<p><span class= "bld">That appear.</span>--Marg., <span class= "ital">that eat of; </span>Heb., <span class= "ital">galash: </span>only here and in the corresponding passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-5.htm" title="Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me: your hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.">Song of Solomon 6:5</a>. The word has had a variety of most contradictory interpretations. The Authorised Version follows the LXX., and has the support of Ewald's great authority. The marginal <span class= "ital">eat of </span>rests only on the existence of cognates in Syriac and Arabic = <span class= "ital">obtained, collected </span>(see Lee's <span class= "ital">Heb. Dict.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which would rather point to such a rendering as, "which they obtain from mount Gilead." The Vulg., <span class= "ital">qu? ascenderunt, </span>is followed by some commentators, though the bulk give the exactly opposite: "come down," or "run down," or "hang down from." In such a difficulty only the context can decide, and any translation suggesting the dark hair flowing in masses round the shoulders is allowable. At the same time, from a tendency of the author to accumulate, and sometimes to confuse, his figures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-12.htm" title="A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-15.htm" title="A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/5-12.htm" title="His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.">Song of Solomon 5:12-13</a>), probably here it is the long, soft, delicate, generally black hair of the Oriental goat which is compared to that of the lady, as well as the general appearance presented by the whole flock suspended on the mountain side.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil; thine hair is as a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Mount Gilead.</span> We commence, at this verse, the loving converse of the bridegroom with the bride, which we must suppose is heard as they travel together in the bridal procession. The words of adoring affection are chiefly spoken by the bridegroom, as is natural in the circumstances, and the reference to the journey, and its consummation in ver. 8, make it certain that the intention is to carry us in thought to the palanquin and the breathings of first love in bridal joy. The poetry is exquisite and truly Eastern, while yet absolutely chaste and pure. The praise of the eyes is common in all erotic poetry. Her eyes gleam, in colour, motion, and lustre, like a pair of doves from behind the veil; showing that the bride is thought of as travelling. The bride was always deeply veiled (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>), as the Roman bride wore the <span class="accented">velum flamineum</span>. The LXX. have mistaken the meaning, rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>. The veil might typify silence or reserve, but the word is <span class="accented">tsammah</span>, which is from a root "to veil," and is righty rendered by Symmachus <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The hair was long and dark, and lay down the shoulders uncovered and free, which added much to the graceful attraction of the bride. In later times it was customary for the hair to be adorned with a wreath of myrtle or roses, or a golden ornament representing Jerusalem. The goats in Syria and the neighbouring countries are mostly black or dark brown, while the sheep are white. Delitzsch says, "A flock of goats encamped upon a mountain (rising up, to one looking from a distance, as in a steep slope and almost perpendicularly), and as if hanging down lengthwise on its sides, presents a lovely view adorning the landscape." It would be especially lovely amid the romantic scenery of Gilead. The, verb rendered "lie along" is otherwise taken by the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Vulgate <span class="accented">ascenderunt.</span> The rabbis differ from one another in their renderings. One says, "which, look, down;" another, "make bare," "quit," or "descend;" another, "are seen." The modern translators vary. Luther says, "shorn;" Houbigant, "hang down;" Kleuken and Ewald, "shows itself;" Gesenius and others, "lie down;" Ginsburg, "rolling down," "running down." Our Revised Version gives, <span class="accented">lie along</span>, which is a very probable meaning. The reference is to the luxuriance and rich colour of the hair. Gilead would be a recollection of the bride's native place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 If each of these comparisons has a meaning applicable to the graces of the church, or of the faithful Christian, they are not clearly known; and great mistakes are made by fanciful guesses. The mountain of myrrh appears to mean the mountain Moriah, on which the temple was built, where the incense was burned, and the people worshipped the Lord. This was his residence till the shadows of the law given to Moses were dispersed by the breaking of the gospel day, and the rising of the Sun of righteousness. And though, in respect of his human nature, Christ is absent from his church on earth, and will continue to be so till the heavenly day break, yet he is spiritually present in his ordinances, and with his people. How fair and comely are believers, when justified in Christ's righteousness, and adorned with spiritual graces! when their thoughts, words, and deeds, though imperfect, are pure, manifesting a heart nourished by the gospel!</body></html>
