The word <span class="accented">tsach</span>, from the root <span class="accented">tsahach</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>), means a bright, shining clearness; it is not the same as <span class="accented">lavan</span>, which would mean "dead white." So in Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> differs from <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The red <span class="accented">adhom</span>, from the root <span class="accented">dam</span>, which means "to condense," is dark red (<span class="accented">rouge puce</span>), no doubt as betokening health and vigour. The pure, delicate white among the Caucasians denotes high rank, superior training, hereditary nobility, as among ourselves the "aristocratic paleness" (cf. Hom., 'I1,' 4:141, "<span class="accented">ivory with purple</span>;" Virg., 'AEn.,' 12:65; Ovid, 'Am.,' 2; ' Eleg.,' 5:39; Hor., Od., 1:13, etc.; Tibull., 'Eleg.,' ext. 4, etc.). The chiefest, that is, the distinguished one, the chosen (so the Greek versions, Syriac, Jerome, Luther). The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">e cohorte selectus.</span> Another rendering is "bannered," furnished with a banner or pennon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) hence the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> as a past participle (so the Venetian <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The numeral (<span class="accented">revava</span>) "<span class="accented">ten thousand"</span> is simply used to represent an innumerable multitude; "myriad" is so used among ourselves (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Even those who have little acquaintance with Christ, cannot but see amiable beauty in others who bear his image. There are hopes of those who begin to inquire concerning Christ and his perfections. Christians, who are well acquainted with Christ themselves, should do all they can to make others know something of him. Divine glory makes him truly lovely in the eyes of all who are enlightened to discern spiritual things. He is white in the spotless innocence of his life, ruddy in the bleeding sufferings he went through at his death. This description of the person of the Beloved, would form, in the figurative language of those times, a portrait of beauty of person and of grace of manners; but the aptness of some of the allusions may not appear to us. He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all that believe. May his love constrain us to live to his glory.</body></html>
