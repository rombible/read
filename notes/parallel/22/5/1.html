The only difficulty lies in the invitation, "Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved" (Marg., <span class= "ital">and be drunken with loves</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Some suppose an invitation to an actual marriage feast; and if sung as an epithalamium, the song might have this double intention. But the margin, "be drunken with loves," suggests the right interpretation. The poet, it has been already said (Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-7.htm" title="I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.">Song of Solomon 2:7</a>), loves to invoke the sympathy of others with his joys, and the following lines of Shelley reproduce the very feeling of this passage. Here, as throughout the poem, it is the "new strong wine of love," and not the fruit of the grape, which is desired and drunk.<p>"Thou art the wine, whose drunkenness is all<p>We can desire, O Love! and happy souls,<p>Ere from thy vine the leaves of autumn fall,<p>Catch thee and feed, from thine o'erflowing bowls,<p>Thousands who thirst for thy ambrosial dew."<p><span class= "ital">Prince Athanase.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</span> <span class="accented">My myrrh with my balsam</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10</a>). There were celebrated plantations at Jericho. The Queen of Sheba brought "of spices very great store;" "There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon." Is there a reference to the conversion of the heathen nations in this? The wine and milk are what God offers to his people (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>) without money and without price. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> is what Chloe gives to Daphnis (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>). It would seem as though the writer intended us to follow the bridal procession to its destination in the royal palace. The bridal night intervenes. The joy of the king in his bride is complete. The climax is reached, and the rest of the song is an amplification. The call to the friends is to celebrate the marriage in a banquet on the second day (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-28.htm">Genesis 29:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a>; Tobit 11:18; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a> and Revelation 19:9). A parallel might be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-26.htm">Psalm 22:26</a>, where Messiah, at the close of his sufferings, salutes his friends, the poor, and as they eat at his table gives them his royal blessing, "Vivat cor vestrum in aeternum!" The perfect state of the Church is represented in Scripture, both in the Old Testament and in the New, as celebrated with universal joy - all tears wiped away from off all faces, and the loud harpings of innumerable harpers. Can we doubt that this wonderful book has tinged the whole of subsequent inspired Scripture? Can we read the descriptions of triumphant rejoicing in the Apocalypse and not believe that the apostolic seer was familiar with this idealized love song? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1 See how ready Christ is to accept the invitations of his people. What little good there is in us would be lost, if he did not preserve it to himself. He also invites his beloved people to eat and drink abundantly. The ordinances in which they honour him, are means of grace.</body></html>
