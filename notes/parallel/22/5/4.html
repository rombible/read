The hole is the aperture made in the door above the lock for the insertion of the hand with the key. The ancient lock was probably like the one in use in Palestine now. It consists of a <span class= "ital">hollow </span>bolt or bar, which passes through a staple fixed to the door and into the door-post. In the staple are a number of movable pins, which drop into corresponding holes in the bolt when it is pushed home, and the door is then locked. To unlock it, the key is slid into the hollow bolt, and the movable pins pushed back by other pins in it, corresponding in size and form, which fill up the holes, and so enable the bolt to be withdrawn. It is said that, in lieu of a proper key, the arm can be inserted into the hollow bolt and the pins be pushed up by the hand, if provided with some soft material, as lard or wax, to fill up the holes, and keep the pins from falling back again till the bolt is withdrawn. This offers one explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-5.htm" title="I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, on the handles of the lock.">Song of Solomon 5:5</a>. Coming to the door and having no key, the lover is supposed to make use of some myrrh, brought as a present, in trying to open the door, and, not succeeding, to go away. The <span class= "ital">sweet smelling </span>(Marg., <span class= "ital">passing, </span>or <span class= "ital">running about</span>) is the myrrh that drops from the tree naturally, before any incision is made in the bark, and is considered specially fine. Others explain <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-5.htm" title="I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, on the handles of the lock.">Song of Solomon 5:5</a> by comparison with the heathen custom alluded to in Lucretius iv. 1173:--<p>"At lacrimans exclusus amator limina saepe<p>Floribus et sertis operit posteisque superbos<p>Unguet amaricino, et foribus miser oscula figit."<p>(Comp. Tibullus, 1:2-14.) Perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-17.htm" title="I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.">Proverbs 7:17</a> makes the comparison allowable, but the first explanation is preferable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/songs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him.</span> The door hole is a part of the door pierced through at the upper part of the lock, or door bolt (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>), that is, by the opening from without to within, or through the opening, as if, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to open the door by pressing back the lock or bolt from within. There was some obstacle. He tailed to open it. It had not been left so that he could easily obtain admittance. The metaphor is very apt and beautiful. How much he loved her! How he tried to come to her! As applied to the Saviour, what infinite suggestiveness! He would be with us, and not only knocks at the door, but is impatient to enter; tries the lock, and too often finds it in vain; he is repelled, he is resisted, he is coldly excluded. <span class="accented">My heart was moved for him.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, "my inner being" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>, where the same word is used of God). It is often employed to express sympathy and affection, especially with tender regret. The later authorities, as the older translations, have "to him" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> over him, or on account of him, in the thought of his wounded heart. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:2-8 Churches and believers, by carelessness and security, provoke Christ to withdraw. We ought to notice our spiritual slumbers and distempers. Christ knocks to awaken us, knocks by his word and Spirit, knocks by afflictions and by our consciences; thus, Re 3:20. When we are unmindful of Christ, still he thinks of us. Christ's love to us should engage ours to him, even in the most self-denying instances; and we only can be gainers by it. Careless souls put slights on Jesus Christ. Another could not be sent to open the door. Christ calls to us, but we have no mind, or pretend we have no strength, or we have no time, and think we may be excused. Making excuses is making light of Christ. Those put contempt upon Christ, who cannot find in their hearts to bear a cold blast, or to leave a warm bed for him. See the powerful influences of Divine grace. He put in his hand to unbolt the door, as one weary of waiting. This betokens a work of the Spirit upon the soul. The believer's rising above self-indulgence, seeking by prayer for the consolations of Christ, and to remove every hinderance to communion with him; these actings of the soul are represented by the hands dropping sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the locks. But the Beloved was gone! By absenting himself, Christ will teach his people to value his gracious visits more highly. Observe, the soul still calls Christ her Beloved. Every desertion is not despair. Lord, I believe, though I must say, Lord, help my unbelief. His words melted me, yet, wretch that I was, I made excuses. The smothering and stifling of convictions will be very bitter to think of, when God opens our eyes. The soul went in pursuit of him; not only prayed, but used means, sought him in the ways wherein he used to be found. The watchmen wounded me. Some refer it to those who misapply the word to awakened consciences. The charge to the daughters of Jerusalem, seems to mean the distressed believer's desire of the prayers of the feeblest Christian. Awakened souls are more sensible of Christ's withdrawings than of any other trouble.</body></html>
