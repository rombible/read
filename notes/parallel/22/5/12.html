If the comparison were to the <span class= "ital">eyes </span>of the dove, this would be a sufficient interpretation, the image being perfect, owing to the ring of bright red skin round the eye of the turtle-dove. But there is no necessity to have recourse to the figure <span class= "ital">comparatio compendiana </span>here, since doves delight in bathing; and though there is a certain delicious haze of indistinctness in the image, the soft iridescence of the bird floating and glancing on the face of the stream might not too extravagantly suggest the quick loving glances of the eye. Keats has a somewhat similar figure:--<p>"To see such lovely eyes in <span class= "ital">swimming search</span><p>After some warm delight, that seems to perch<p><span class= "ital">Dove-like </span>in the dim cell lying beyond<p>Their upper lids;"<p>and Dr. Ginsburg aptly quotes from the <span class= "ital">Gitagovinda: </span>"The glances of her eyes played like a pair of <span class= "ital">water-birds </span>of azure plumage, that sport near a full-grown lotus in <span class= "ital">a pool </span>in the season of dew." The words w<span class= "ital">ashed in milk </span>refer to the white of the eye, which swells round the pupil like the <span class= "ital">fulness </span>of water, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the swelling wave round the dove. The parallelism is like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-5.htm" title="I am black, but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.">Song of Solomon 1:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/songs/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Even those who have little acquaintance with Christ, cannot but see amiable beauty in others who bear his image. There are hopes of those who begin to inquire concerning Christ and his perfections. Christians, who are well acquainted with Christ themselves, should do all they can to make others know something of him. Divine glory makes him truly lovely in the eyes of all who are enlightened to discern spiritual things. He is white in the spotless innocence of his life, ruddy in the bleeding sufferings he went through at his death. This description of the person of the Beloved, would form, in the figurative language of those times, a portrait of beauty of person and of grace of manners; but the aptness of some of the allusions may not appear to us. He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all that believe. May his love constrain us to live to his glory.</body></html>
