The Authorised Version has unfortunately rendered all the verbs in this section in the <span class= "ital">past</span> tense, thus obscuring the sense of the poem. They all refer to a scene really future, but brought by the grasp of faith into the immediate <span class= "ital">present.</span> In the Hebrew some of these verbs are in the future tense, others in the past used with the force of a present, the "prophetic perfect" as it is sometimes termed. Such a use of the Hebrew preterite is common in Biblical poetry, notably in the Book of Psalms. It is almost impossible to reproduce in English the slight distinction between these tenses. While, however, his eyes are thus fixed on a future deliverance, the basis of all Habakkuk's anticipations is God's doings in time past; the chief features in the portraiture are, in fact, borrowed from the Books of Exodus and Judges.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">God came</span>.--Render "<span class= "ital">God shall come from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran.

As he then came in glory to make a covenant with his people, so will he appear again in majesty to deliver them from the power of evil and to execute judgment. The verbs throughout are best rendered in the present. The prophet takes his stand in time preceding the action of the verb, and hence uses the future tense, thus also showing that he is prophesying of a great event to come, symbolized by these earlier manifestations. Habakkuk here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> trees the word <span class="accented">Eloah</span>, which is not found in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, or the other minor prophets; it occurs once in Isaiah, twice in Deuteronomy, and frequently in Job. There is no ground for the contention that its employment belongs to the latest stage of Hebrew. <span class="accented">Teman</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Edom; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ab Austro</span> (see notes on Amos 1:12 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9</a>). In Moses' song the Lord is said to come from Sinai. Habakkuk omits Sinai, says Pusey which was the emblem of the Law, and points to another Lawgiver, like unto Moses, telling how he who spake the Law, God. should come in the likeness of man. The Holy One.

They both lay south of Canaan; and there is propriety in representing the redeemer and deliverer appearing in the south, as the Chaldean invader comes from the north. The LXX. adds two translations of the word "Pharan," viz. "shady," "rough;" according to its etymology it might also mean "lovely." <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. This term occurs also in vers. 9, 13, and frequently in the Psalms, but nowhere else, and indicates some change in the music when the ode was sung in the temple service. What is the exact change is a matter of great uncertainty. Some take it to indicate "a pause;" others, connecting it with <span class="accented">salah</span>, "to lift up," render it "elevation," and suppose it means the raising of the voice, or the strengthening of the accompaniment, as by the blast of trumpets. The meaning must be left undetermined, though it must be added that it is always found at the end of a verse or hemistich, where there is a pause or break in the thought, or, as some say, some strongly accented words occur. <span class="cmt_word">His glory covered the heavens.</span> His majestic brightness spread over the heavens, dimming the gleam of sun and stars; or it may mean his boundless majesty fills the highest heavens and encompasses its inhabitants. His praise. This is usually explained to signify that the earth and all that dwell therein, at this glorious manifestion, utter their praise. But there is no allusion as yet to the manner in which the appearance is received, and in ver. 6 it produces fear and trembling; so it is best to take "praise" in the sense of "matter of praise," that glory "which was calculated to call forth universal adoration" (Henderson). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:3-15 God's people, when in distress, and ready to despair, seek help by considering the days of old, and the years of ancient times, and by pleading them with God in prayer. The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!</body></html>
