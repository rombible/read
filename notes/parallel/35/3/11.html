The rest of the verse is best rendered, <span class= "ital">at the light of Thine arrows which go abroad, at the bright glancing of Thy spear.</span> Apparently, the conception is that the surpassing brightness of the theophany shames the heavenly bodies, which accordingly cease to pursue their journey.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sun and moon stood still in their habitation;</span> or, <span class="accented">stand still, or withdraw into their habitation.</span> They hide themselves in the tabernacles whence they are said to emerge when they shine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a>, etc.). Overpowered with the splendour of God's presence, the heavenly luminaries hide their light in this day of the Lord (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2, 10, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-20.htm">Amos 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). The miracle of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>, etc.) may have suggested some of the language here, but the idea is quite different. <span class="cmt_word">At the light of thine arrows they went;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sun and moon fled away discomfited at the glory of God's weapons, his arrows gleaming with light. The idea may be that, in the absence of the sun and moon, the terrific scene was illuminated only by flashes of lightning. "Lightnings" are sometimes celled God's "arrows," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-17.htm">Psalm 77:17</a>, etc.; but the image here is rather of the arms of a warrior. Many supply the relative in the sentence, and render, "arrows which shoot along." This seems to be unnecessary, and is not supported by the versions. There is no special reference to the hailstorm at Beth-horon, which discomfited the Cananites, but enabled the Israelites to pass on to victory (Joshua, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>.). It is the terror of the judgment that is adumbrated, when the Lord shall come in flames of fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>), and the heavens shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:3-15 God's people, when in distress, and ready to despair, seek help by considering the days of old, and the years of ancient times, and by pleading them with God in prayer. The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!</body></html>
