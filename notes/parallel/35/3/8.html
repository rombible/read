The "horses" and "chariots" which are here the symbols of Divine might, come in the more fittingly in view of Exodus 14 (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm" title="You did strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.">Habakkuk 3:14</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> where Pharaoh, pursued with "horses and chariots," only to find Jehovah Himself arrayed against him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Interrupting his description of the theophany, the prophet asks the motive of this wrathful revelation. This is done, not with expectation of an answer, but giving life and vigour to the composition. Such sudden transitions are not uncommon (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-12.htm">Judges 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-19.htm">Psalm 78:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Was the Lord displeased against the rivers?</span> <span class="accented">Was it against the rivers, O Jehovah? was thy wrath kindled against the rivers?</span> Was God angry with inanimate nature, when he showed his power, for instance, in the Nile and the Jordan and the Red Sea? God meant more by these acts. He showed his supremacy over all creation, and his will to save his people and to crush all opposition to the execution of his great design (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">That thou didst ride upon thine horses.</span> The prophet speaks of the Lord as a Leader of a mighty host which came with chariots and horses to defend the Israelites and to crush their foes (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy chariots of salvation.</span> "And," which is not in the Hebrew, is better omitted, the clause being an explanation of "thine horses." <span class="cmt_word">The chariots come for the salvation</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the deliverance, of Israel (ver. 13).

The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!</body></html>
