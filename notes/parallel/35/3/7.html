A plausible theory, however, as old as the Targum, connects this verse with later episodes in Israel's history. "Cushan" is identified with that Mesopotamian oppressor, "Cushan-rishathaim," whom the judge Othniel overcame. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/3-8.htm" title="Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.">Judges 3:8-10</a>). And "Midian" is interpreted by Judges 6, which records how Gideon delivered Israel from Midianite oppression. Both names thus become typical instances of tyranny subdued by Jehovah's intervention. We prefer the other interpretation, because the prophet's eye is still fixed apparently on the earlier history (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm" title="Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was your anger against the rivers? was your wrath against the sea, that you did ride on your horses and your chariots of salvation?">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and a reference here to the time of the Judges would mar the elimactic symmetry of the composition. "Cushan," however, is never used elsewhere for "Cush," though the LXX. understood it in this meaning. "Curtains" in the second hemistich is merely a variation on "tents" in the first. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-5.htm" title="I am black, but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.">Song of Solomon 1:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - As God moves in his majesty the various nations are struck with fear, as of old were the peoples that heard of the Exodus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I saw</span>.

Ethiopia and Midian are named, as God is supposed to advance from the south. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:3-15 God's people, when in distress, and ready to despair, seek help by considering the days of old, and the years of ancient times, and by pleading them with God in prayer. The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!</body></html>
