He comes to avenge and judge, therefore <span class="cmt_word">before him went the pestilence.</span> Before him stalks plague, to punish his enemies and the disobedient, as in Egypt, in Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-9.htm">1 Samuel 5:9, 11</a>); and among his own people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-37.htm">Numbers 14:37</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>). For "pestilence" the LXX. reads "word." Burning coals went forth at his feet. "Fiery belts" followed his advance, "hailstones and coals of fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12, 13</a>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-8.htm">Psalm 97:8</a>, "A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies on every side." But, regarding the parallelisms of the hemistiches, it is better to take <span class="accented">resheph</span> in the sense of "fever heat," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>; scorching fever follows in his train. Jerome translates the word, <span class="accented">diabolus</span>, looking on the evil spirit as the agent of the Divine vengeance. The Jews, he says, had a tradition that Satan was called <span class="accented">Reseph</span>, from the speed of his movements. The LXX. has, "It (the word) shall go forth into the plains," which Jerome interprets, "shall make the crooked straight and the rough ways smooth." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:3-15 God's people, when in distress, and ready to despair, seek help by considering the days of old, and the years of ancient times, and by pleading them with God in prayer. The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!</body></html>
