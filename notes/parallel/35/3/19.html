The rubric may be interpreted either "To the precentor. (To be performed) on my stringed instruments," or, "To him who presides over my stringed instruments." The fact that the same direction occurs with the words in the same order in six Psalms perhaps favours the latter rendering in all cases. The preposition <span class= "ital">al</span> would, however, in this case be appropriate rather than <span class= "ital">b</span>' On the terms used, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-1.htm" title="Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: you have enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.">Psalm 4:1</a>. It has been inferred from the use of the possessive pronoun, "<span class= "ital">my</span> stringed instruments," that Habakkuk was a Levite, and therefore himself entitled to accompany the Temple music. But see Introduction, ? 1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God is my strength;</span> more accurately, J<span class="accented">ehovah, the Lord, is my strength</span>, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-32.htm">Psalm 18:32</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He will make my feet like hinds' feet</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-33.htm">Psalm 18:33</a>).

This is a musical direction, answering to the heading in ver. 1, and implies that the ode is committed to the conductor of the temple music, to be by him adapted for the public service to the accompaniment of stringed instruments. Such directions are elsewhere always found at the beginning, not the end, of psalms (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4.htm">Psalm 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6.htm">Psalm 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54.htm">Psalm 54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67.htm">Psalm 67</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76.htm">Psalm 76</a>.). It has been thought that the suffix of the first person, "my stringed instruments," denotes that Habakkuk had a right to take part in the temple service, and was therefore a Levite; but it is very doubtful whether this suffix is not a clerical error, as Kuenen and Ewald suppose, or merely paragogic. Certainly neither the Greek, Latin, nor Syriac Versions afford it any confirmation. These versions make the subscription part of the ode. Thus LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, He maketh me to mount upon the high places, that I may conquer by his song;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Super excelsa mea deducet me victor</span> (<span class="accented">victori</span>, Cod.

A good hope through grace is founded in holy fear. The prophet looked back upon the experiences of the church in former ages, and observed what great things God had done for them, and so was not only recovered, but filled with holy joy. He resolved to delight and triumph in the Lord; for when all is gone, his God is not gone. Destroy the vines and the fig-trees, and you make all the mirth of a carnal heart to cease. But those who, when full, enjoyed God in all, when emptied and poor, can enjoy all in God. They can sit down upon the heap of the ruins of their creature-comforts, and even then praise the Lord, as the God of their salvation, the salvation of the soul, and rejoice in him as such, in their greatest distresses. Joy in the Lord is especially seasonable when we meet with losses and crosses in the world. Even when provisions are cut off, to make it appear that man lives not by bread alone, we may be supplied by the graces and comforts of God's Spirit. Then we shall be strong for spiritual warfare and work, and with enlargement of heart may run the way of his commandments, and outrun our troubles. And we shall be successful in spiritual undertakings. Thus the prophet, who began his prayer with fear and trembling, ends it with joy and triumph. And thus faith in Christ prepares for every event. The name of Jesus, when we can speak of Him as ours, is balm for every wound, a cordial for every care. It is as ointment poured forth, shedding fragrance through the whole soul. In the hope of a heavenly crown, let us sit loose to earthly possessions and comforts, and cheerfully bear up under crosses. Yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry; and where he is, we shall be also.</body></html>
