" Jehovah's doings at the <span class= "ital">beginning</span> of the years are well known; the prophet seeks that they may be manifested again, now in the <span class= "ital">midst</span> of the years. The petition "in wrath remember mercy," is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm" title="Behold you among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which you will not believe, though it be told you.">Habakkuk 1:5</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> It implies--though Thy visitation be well deserved, yet mercifully limit its duration, as on former occasions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The proemium, in which the prophet expresses his fear at the coming judgment, and prays God in his wrath to</span> remember mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Thy speech;</span> or, <span class="accented">the report of thee</span>; the declaration made by God in the preceding chapters concerning the punishment of the Jews and the destruction of the Chaldeans. The LXX., regarding the ambiguity of the Hebrew, gives a double rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "I heard thy report," and "I considered thy works." Pusey considers that both meanings are intended, viz. both what God had lately declared, and all that might be heard of God, his greatness and his workings. <span class="cmt_word">Was afraid.</span> The revelation of God's interposition makes the prophet tremble. <span class="cmt_word">Revive thy work.</span> God's work is the twofold judgment spoken of above; and the prophet prays God to "quicken" and make it live, because, though it brings temporary distress upon his countrymen, it will also cause the destruction of their enemies, and re-establish the Jews and crown them with salvation, and make the glory of God known to all the earth. Dr. Briggs ('Messianic Prophecy,' p. 234) translates, "Jahveh, I have heard the report of thee; I fear, Jahveh, thy work. In the midst of the years revive him (Israel)." He explains God's "work" to be his acts in theophany - his judgment, especially as in ver. 16, the cause of fear to the psalmist. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the years.</span> The "years" are the period between the announcement of the judgment and its final accomplishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>); the prophet prays that God would manifest his power, not merely at the extreme limit of this epoch, but earlier, sooner. This overthrow of the world power forms, as it were, the central point of history, the beginning of a new age which shall culminate in the Messianic kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Make known.</span> Let all the earth know and acknowledge thy work. The LXX. have given two or more versions of this passage, one of which is remarkable. Thus they read, "In the midst of two animals (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) thou shalt be known; when the years draw nigh thou shalt be well known; when the time is come thou shalt be revealed." The rendering, "two animals," arises from a confusion of words but many of the Fathers, who were conversant with the Greek Scriptures, saw herein a reference to the incarnation of our blessed Lord, as lying in the stable at Bethlehem between the ox and the ass, which was the mystical explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>, "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib." Others interpreted the two animals of the two thieves between whom Christ was crucified; or of angels and men; or Jews and Gentiles; or the two Testaments; or Moses and Elias. Others again accented the word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> so as to understand "two lives," the present and the future, in the midst of which the Judge shall appear; or the life of Christ before his death and after his resurrection. There is a great truth underlying most of these interpretations, namely, that this magnificent hymn is concerned with the victories of Christ and his Church. In wrath remember mercy. When thine anger is displayed by sending the Chaldeans against us, remember thy mercy, and make a speedy end of our misery, and mitigate our enemies' cruelty (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>; and vers. 9, 13, 18, 19 of this chapter). The LXX. gives a double version, "In the troubling of my soul, in wrath, thou wilt remember mercy." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1,2 The word prayer seems used here for an act of devotion. The Lord would revive his work among the people in the midst of the years of adversity. This may be applied to every season when the church, or believers, suffer under afflictions and trials. Mercy is what we must flee to for refuge, and rely upon as our only plea. We must not say, Remember our merit, but, Lord, remember thy own mercy.</body></html>
