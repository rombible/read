His anxiety is, however, swept aside by a joyful and overpowering confidence in God. These verses are a kind of appendix to the preceding poem.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">That I might rest</span> . . .--Better, <span class= "ital">that I should be resting quiet in the day of trouble, when he cometh up against the people who is to oppress them.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - &sect; 4.

"I heard" the report of thee (vex. 2). The LXX. refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>, rendering, "I watched." If the former part is the paean of the congregation, the present is the prophet's own utterance expressive of his dismay at the prospect before him. <span class="cmt_word">My belly trembled.</span> My inmost part, my inward self, trembled with fear (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My lips quivered at the voice.</span> My lips quivered with fear at the voice of God that sounded in me (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), proclaiming these awful judgments. The word rendered" quivered" (<span class="accented">tsalal</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> applied to the tingling of the ears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a>), and implies that the prophet's lips so trembled that he was scarcely able to utter speech. The LXX. renders, "from the voice of the prayers of my lips." <span class="cmt_word">Rottenness entered into my bones.</span> This is an hyperbolical expression, denoting that the firmest, strongest parts of his body were relaxed and weakened with utter fear, as if his very bones were cankered and corrupted, and there was no marrow in them. <span class="cmt_word">And I trembled in myself.</span> The last word (<span class="accented">tachtai</span>) is rendered variously: "under me," according to the Greek and Latin Versions, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in my knees and feet, so that I reeled and stumbled; or, "in my place," on the spot where I stand (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-29.htm">Exodus 16:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I might rest in the day of trouble;</span> better, <span class="accented">I who shall rest in the day of tribulation.</span> The prophet suddenly expresses his confidence that he shall have rest in this affliction; amid this terror and awe he is sure that there remaineth a rest for the people of God. This sentiment leads naturally to the beautiful expression of hope in the concluding paragraph (ver. 17, etc.). Keil and others render, "tremble that I am to wait quietly for the day of tribulation;" that I am to sit still and await the day of affliction. But Pusey denies that the verb (<span class="accented">nuach</span>) ever means "to wait patiently for," or "to be silent about;" its uniform signification is "to rest" from labour or from trouble. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "I will rest in the day of affliction;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ut requiescam in die tribulationis. <span class="cmt_word"></span>When he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</span> This should be, <span class="accented">When he that invades with bands comes up against the people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the day when the Chaldeans attack the Israelites (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>, where the word "bands" is also used). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: "To go up against the people of my sojourning;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ut ascendam ad populum aecinctum nostrum</span>, which is thus explained: "I will bear all things patiently, even death itself, that I may attain to the happy company of those blessed heroes who fought for their country and their God." It is obvious to remark that this is a gloss, not on the original text, but on the erroneous version. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:16-19 When we see a day of trouble approach, it concerns us to prepare. A good hope through grace is founded in holy fear. The prophet looked back upon the experiences of the church in former ages, and observed what great things God had done for them, and so was not only recovered, but filled with holy joy. He resolved to delight and triumph in the Lord; for when all is gone, his God is not gone. Destroy the vines and the fig-trees, and you make all the mirth of a carnal heart to cease. But those who, when full, enjoyed God in all, when emptied and poor, can enjoy all in God. They can sit down upon the heap of the ruins of their creature-comforts, and even then praise the Lord, as the God of their salvation, the salvation of the soul, and rejoice in him as such, in their greatest distresses. Joy in the Lord is especially seasonable when we meet with losses and crosses in the world. Even when provisions are cut off, to make it appear that man lives not by bread alone, we may be supplied by the graces and comforts of God's Spirit. Then we shall be strong for spiritual warfare and work, and with enlargement of heart may run the way of his commandments, and outrun our troubles. And we shall be successful in spiritual undertakings. Thus the prophet, who began his prayer with fear and trembling, ends it with joy and triumph. And thus faith in Christ prepares for every event. The name of Jesus, when we can speak of Him as ours, is balm for every wound, a cordial for every care. It is as ointment poured forth, shedding fragrance through the whole soul. In the hope of a heavenly crown, let us sit loose to earthly possessions and comforts, and cheerfully bear up under crosses. Yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry; and where he is, we shall be also.</body></html>
