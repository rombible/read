In the Assyrian monuments the bow case forms part of the quiver, and holds only the lower half of the bow (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Mon.,' 2:55, edit. 1864). It was fastened to the side of the chariot or carried at the back of the archer. (For the general sense, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>.) In the Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>) he that sits on the white horse has a bow. <span class="cmt_word">According to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou doest all this to confirm the promises of deliverance and salvation made to the tribes of Israel This sense is satisfactory; but the Hebrew text is corrupt, and cannot be explained with any certainty. The Revised Version gives," The oaths to the tribes were a sure word;" in the margin, "Sworn were the chastisements (Hebrew, 'rods') of thy word." Thus Dr. Briggs: "Sworn are the rods of thy word." Orelli translates," Oaths, rods of the word," and explains the clause to mean that the Lord comes to execute the denounced punishment, which proceeds from his mouth like chastising rods. The word <span class="accented">mattoth</span> is translated "tribes" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2</a>) or "rods." Keil contends for the latter, as instruments of chastisement, rendering," Rods are sworn by word" Henderson, taking the words as a military signal, curiously translates, "'Sevens of spears' was the word." Pusey supports the Authorized Version, which, indeed. gives a good sense, and is probably correct It is virtually supported by Jerome, who has, "Suscitans suscitabis arcum tuum, juramenta tribubus quae locutus es," "Thou wilt awaken the oaths," which, so long as the evil prospered, seemed to be forgotten and sleeping. The LXX. emits the word rendered "oaths," and translates <span class="accented">mattoth</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Thou didst surely bend thy bow against sceptres." <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>. A pause ensues before the introduction of a new series of natural phenomena, accompanying the Lord's epiphany (see on ver. 3). The next clause would be more fitly joined with ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst cleave the earth with</span> (or, <span class="accented">into</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>rivers</span>. This refers to some catastrophe like that which happened at the Flood, when "the fountains of the great deep were broken up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16</a>). Others think that the allusion is to the miracles at the Red Sea, or Sinai, or Rephidim in the wilderness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74.htm">Psalm 74</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a>. But though the prophet glances at such particular circumstances, his scope is more general. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:3-15 God's people, when in distress, and ready to despair, seek help by considering the days of old, and the years of ancient times, and by pleading them with God in prayer. The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!</body></html>
