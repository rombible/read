It is impossible to give the English reader an idea of the rhythmical structure of this beautiful composition. We will only observe that it is independent of the arrangement in verses, and that the poem (except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/habakkuk/3-7.htm" title="I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.">Habakkuk 3:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm" title="You went forth for the salvation of your people, even for salvation with your anointed; you wounded the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation to the neck. Selah.">Habakkuk 3:13</a>, <span class= "ital">fin.</span>) consists of lines each containing exactly three words.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Upon Shigionoth.</span>--This term points, not to the contents of the composition, but either to its metrical structure or its musical setting. See on the Inscription of Psalms 7. Inasmuch as this ode is throughout an account of the deliverance anticipated by prayerful faith, it is called not a Psalm, <span class= "ital">mizmor,</span> but a Prayer, <span class= "ital">t</span>'<span class= "ital">philtah.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-19.</span> - Part II. PSALM OR PRAYER OF HABAKKUK. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - &sect; 1. <span class="accented">The title.</span> <span class="cmt_word">A prayer.</span> There is only one formal prayer in the ode, that in ver. 2; but the term is used of any devotional composition; and, indeed, the whole poem may be regarded as the development of the precatory sentences in the proemium (seethe inscriptions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17.htm">Psalm 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86.htm">Psalm 86</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142.htm">Psalm 142</a>; and the last verse of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>, the subscription of Book II.). (For other hymns in the prophetical books, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>, and 35; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19.htm">Ezekiel 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2.htm">Jonah 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6</a>, etc.; and as parallel to this ode, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a>, etc.; Psalms 77:13-20; 114; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11-14</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Of Habakkuk the prophet.</span> The name and title of the author are prefixed to show that this is no mere private effusion, but an outpouring of prophecy under Divine inspiration. <span class="cmt_word">Upon Shigionoth</span> (comp. title of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>.); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1fa0;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "with song;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">pro ignorantiis.</span> For this latter rendering Jerome had etymological ground, but did not sufficiently consider the use of <span class="accented">shiggayon</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>, where it indicates the style of poetry, nor, as Keil shows, the fact that all the headings of Psalms introduced, as the present, with <span class="accented">al</span>, refer either to the melody, or accompaniment, or style in which they were to be sung. The Revised Version gives, "set to Shigionoth;" and the expression is best explained to mean, in an impassioned or triumphal strain, with rapid change of emotion, a dithy rambic song - a description which admirably suits this ode. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1,2 The word prayer seems used here for an act of devotion. The Lord would revive his work among the people in the midst of the years of adversity. This may be applied to every season when the church, or believers, suffer under afflictions and trials. Mercy is what we must flee to for refuge, and rely upon as our only plea. We must not say, Remember our merit, but, Lord, remember thy own mercy.</body></html>
