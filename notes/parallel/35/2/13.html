Jeremiah adds the explanatory clauses, "the broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is it not of the Lord of hosts?</span> Hath not God ordained that this, about to be mentioned, should be the issue of all this evil splendour? <span class="cmt_word">That the people shall labour in the very fire;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that the peoples labour for the fire</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the Chaldees and such like nations expended all this toil on cities and fortresses only to supply food for fire, which, the prophet sees, will be their end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-16.htm">Isaiah 40:16</a>). Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-58.htm">Jeremiah 51:58</a>) applies these and the following words to the destruction of Babylon. This is indeed <span class="cmt_word">to weary themselves for very vanity</span>. Babylon, when it was finally taken, was given over to fire and sword (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-32.htm">Jeremiah 50:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-14 The prophet reads the doom of all proud and oppressive powers that bear hard upon God's people. The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.</body></html>
