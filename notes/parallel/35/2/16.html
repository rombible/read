Thou hast revelled in thy shameless conduct to the defencelses, but this redounds to thy dishonour, and will only add to the disgrace of thy fall The Septuagint joins this clause with part of the following: "Drink thou also fulness of shame for glory." Drink thou also the cup of wrath and retribution. <span class="cmt_word">Let thy foreskin be uncovered.</span> Be thou in turn treated with the same ignominy with which thou hast treated others, the figure in ver. 15 being here repeated (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>). It is otherwise translated, "Be thou," or "show thyself, uncircumcised." This, in a Jew's eyes, would be the very climax of degradation. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">consopire</span>, from a slightly different reading. The LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> "Be tossed, O my heart, and shaken." The present text is much more appropriate, though the Syriac and Arabic follow the Greek here. <span class="cmt_word">The cup of the Lord's right hand.</span> Retributive vengeance is often thus figured (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be turned unto thee.</span> God himself shall bring round the cup of suffering and vengeance to thee in thy turn, and thou shalt be made to drink it to the dregs, so that shameful spewing (<span class="accented">foul shame</span>) shall be on thy glory. The <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="accented">kikalon</span> is regarded as an intensive signifying "the utmost ignominy" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, Septuagint), or as two words, or a compound word, meaning <span class="accented">vomitus ignominiae</span> (Vulgate). It was probably used by the prophet to suggest both ideas. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-20 A severe woe is pronounced against drunkenness; it is very fearful against all who are guilty of drunkenness at any time, and in any place, from the stately palace to the paltry ale-house. To give one drink who is in want, who is thirsty and poor, or a weary traveller, or ready to perish, is charity; but to give a neighbour drink, that he may expose himself, may disclose secret concerns, or be drawn into a bad bargain, or for any such purpose, this is wickedness. To be guilty of this sin, to take pleasure in it, is to do what we can towards the murder both of soul and body. There is woe to him, and punishment answering to the sin. The folly of worshipping idols is exposed. The Lord is in his holy temple in heaven, where we have access to him in the way he has appointed. May we welcome his salvation, and worship him in his earthly temples, through Christ Jesus, and by the influence of the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
