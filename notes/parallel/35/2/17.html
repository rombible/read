All these outrages shall in due time be Avenged on himself. Some commentators, however, explain the expression as a bold synecdoche, Lebanon representing the Holy Land (of which it was the beauty), or even the Temple, both of which Nebuchadnezzar laid waste.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: <span class="accented">iniquitas Libani</span> (Vulgate). It would be plainer if translated, "the violence against," or "practised on, Lebanon," as the sentence refers to the devastation inflicted by the Chaldeans on the forests of Lebanon (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>). Jerome confines the expression in the text to the demolition of the temple at Jerusalem in the construction of which much cedar was employed; others take Lebanon as a figure for Palestine generally, or for Jerusalem itself; but it is best understood literally. The same devastation which the Chaldeans made in Lebanon shall "cover," overwhelm, and destroy them. <span class="cmt_word">And the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid.</span> The introduction of the relative is not required, and the passage may be better translated, <span class="accented">And the destruction of beasts made them</span> (others read "thee") <span class="accented">afraid.</span> Septuagint, "And the wretchedness of the beasts shall affright thee." Jerome, in his commentary, renders, "Et vastitas animalium opprimet te." The meaning is that the wholesale destruction of the wild animals of Lebanon, occasioned by the operations of the Chaldeans, shall be visited upon this people. They warred not only against men, but against the lower creatures too; and for this retributive punishment awaited them. <span class="cmt_word">Because of men's blood,</span> etc. The reason rendered in ver. 8 is here repeated. Of the land, etc., means "toward" or "against" the land. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-20 A severe woe is pronounced against drunkenness; it is very fearful against all who are guilty of drunkenness at any time, and in any place, from the stately palace to the paltry ale-house. To give one drink who is in want, who is thirsty and poor, or a weary traveller, or ready to perish, is charity; but to give a neighbour drink, that he may expose himself, may disclose secret concerns, or be drawn into a bad bargain, or for any such purpose, this is wickedness. To be guilty of this sin, to take pleasure in it, is to do what we can towards the murder both of soul and body. There is woe to him, and punishment answering to the sin. The folly of worshipping idols is exposed. The Lord is in his holy temple in heaven, where we have access to him in the way he has appointed. May we welcome his salvation, and worship him in his earthly temples, through Christ Jesus, and by the influence of the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
