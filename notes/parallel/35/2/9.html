The expression <span class= "ital">sets his nest on high</span> finds more than sufficient illustration in the exaggerated accounts of Babylon given by Herodotus and Ctesias. The former gives 337� feet, the latter 300 feet, as the height of its walls. The height of the towers was, according to Ctesias, 420 feet. There were 250 of these towers, irregularly disposed, to guard the weaker parts of the wall. The space included by these colossal outworks was, according to Herodotus, about 200 square miles.<p>The language of this verse recalls Jeremiah's rebuke of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm" title="Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;">Jeremiah 22:13</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> There, however, the sentence is on individual sin, here it is on that of a nation personified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - &sect; 9. <span class="accented">The second woe: for their avarice, violence, and cunning.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That coveteth an evil covetousness to his house;</span> better, <span class="accented">gaineth evil gains for his house.</span> The "house" is the royal family or dynasty, as in ver. 10; and the Chaldean is denounced for thinking to secure its stability and permanence by amassing godless gains. <span class="cmt_word">That he may set his nest on high</span>. This is a figurative expression, denoting security as well as pride and self-confidence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>), and denotes the various means which the Chaldeans employed to establish and secure their power (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-14.htm">Isaiah 14:14</a>). Some see in the words an allusion to the formidable fortifications raised by Nebuchadnezzar for the protection of Babylon, and the wonderful palace erected by him as a royal residence (see Rawlinson, 'Ant. Men.,' 3:340, etc., edit. 1865). It is certain that Nebuchadnezzar and other monarchs, after successful expeditions, turned their attention to building and enriching towns, temples, and palaces (see Josephus, 'Cont. Ap.,' 1:19, 7, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">From the power of evil;</span> <span class="accented">from the hand of evil</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from all calamity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-14 The prophet reads the doom of all proud and oppressive powers that bear hard upon God's people. The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.</body></html>
