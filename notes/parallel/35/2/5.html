Two more charges are thus added to the gravamen of <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm" title="Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.">Habakkuk 2:4</a>. Not only are the Chaldaeans arrogant, but drunkards, and insatiably covetous. The former charge is expressed in a kind of proverb, "(It is a known fact that) wine is treacherous." Perhaps the aphorisms of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-1.htm" title="Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whoever is deceived thereby is not wise.">Proverbs 20:1</a> are in Habakkuk's mind: "Wine is a mocker, strong drink is noisy." The other charge, that of rapacity, also recalls the Book of Proverbs, where the insatiable appetite of death and Hades is twice described. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm" title="Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.">Proverbs 27:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-16.htm" title="The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that said not, It is enough.">Proverbs 30:16</a>.) The charge of drunkenness is illustrated in Rawlinson, <span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies,</span> vol. 2, 504-507.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - &sect; 7. <span class="accented">The character of the Chaldeans in some particulars is intimated.</span> The general proposition in the former hemistich of ver. 4 is here applied to the Chaldeans, in striking contrast to the lot of the just in the latter clause. <span class="cmt_word">Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine.</span> This should be, <span class="accented">And moreover, wine is treacherous.</span> A kind of proverbial saying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quomodo vinum potantem decipit.</span> There is no word expressive of comparison in the original, though it may be supplied to complete the sense. The intemperate habits of the Babylonians are well attested (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-3.htm">Daniel 5:3, 4</a>; Quint. Curt., 5:1, "Babylonii maxime in vinum et quae ebrietatem sequuntur effusi sunt;" comp. Her., 1:191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:5. 15). They used beth the fermented sap of the palm tree as well as the juice of the grape, the latter chiefly imported from abroad. "The wealthy Babylonians were fond of drinking to excess; their banquets were magnificent, but generally ended in drunkenness" (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Men.,' 3:450, edit. 1865). Neither the Septuagint, nor the Syriac, nor the Coptic Version has any mention of wine in this passage. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "the arrogant and the scorner." <span class="cmt_word">He is a proud man, neither keepeth he at home;</span> <span class="accented">a haughty man, he resteth not.</span> His pride is always impelling him to new raids and conquests. This is quite the character of the later Chaldeans, and is consistent with the latter part of the verse. The comparison, then, is this: As wine raises the spirits and excites men to great efforts which in the end deceive them, so pride rouses these men to go on their insatiate course of conquest, which shall one day prove their ruin. The verb translated "keepeth at home" has the secondary sense of "being decorous;" hence the Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Sic</span> <span class="accented">erit vir superbus, et non decorabitur</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as wine first exhilarates and then makes a man contemptible, so pride, which begins by exalting a man, ends by bringing him to ignominy. Others take the verb in the sense of "continueth not," explaining that the destruction of Babylon is here intimated. But what follows makes against this interpretation. The LXX. gives, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, which Jerome, combining with it his own version, paraphrases, "Sic vir superbus non decorabitur, nec voluntatem suam perducet ad finem; et juxta Symmachum, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, hoc est, in rerum omnium erit penuria." <span class="cmt_word">Who enlargeth his desire as hell;</span> Hebrew, Sheol. Hell is called insatiable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-16.htm">Proverbs 30:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is as death,</span> which seizes all creatures and spares none. <span class="cmt_word">People</span>; <span class="accented">peoples.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-14 The prophet reads the doom of all proud and oppressive powers that bear hard upon God's people. The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.</body></html>
