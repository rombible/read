Compare another application of the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>. Jerome quotes Cicero, 'Orat. pro Marcello,' 10, "Parietes, medius fidius, ut mihi videntur, hujus curiae tibi gratias agere gestiunt, quod brevi tempore futura sit ilia auctoritas in his majorum suorum et suis sedibus" (comp. Eurip., 'Hippol.,' 418, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc7;</span>: Ovid, 'Metam.,' 2:696, "Tutus eas: lapis iste prius tua furta loquetur"). Wordsworth sees a literal fulfilment of these words in the appalling circumstance at Belshazzar's feast, when a hand wrote on the palace wall the doom of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</span> "The tie beam out of the timber work shall" take up the refrain, and "answer" the stone from the wall. The Hebrew word (<span class="accented">Kaphis</span>) rendered "beam" is an <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It is explained as above by St. Jerome, being referred to a verb meaning "to bind." Thus Symmachus and Theodotion translate it by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Henderson and others think it means "a half brick," and Aquila renders it by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span>, "something baked." But we have no evidence that the Babylonians in their sumptuous edifices interlaced timber and half bricks (see Pusey, p. 419, note 23). The LXX. gives, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, a beetle, a worm, from the wood. Hence, referring to Christ on the cross, St. Ambrose ('Orat. de Obit. Theod.,' 46) writes, "Adoravit ilium qui pependit in ligno, illum inquam qui sicut scarabaeus clamavit, ut persecutoribus suis peccata condonaret." St. Cyril argues that tie beams were called <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> from their clinging to and supporting wall or roof. Some reason for this supposition is gained by the fact that the word <span class="accented">canterius</span>, or <span class="accented">cantherius, is</span> used in Latin in the sense of "rafter." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-14 The prophet reads the doom of all proud and oppressive powers that bear hard upon God's people. The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.</body></html>
