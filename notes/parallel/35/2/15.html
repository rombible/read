But we much prefer to treat the language as figurative. The invader has made his neighbours drink the cup of his cruel anger till they have reached the depths of shameful degradation. He, too, shall drink "of the cup of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-8.htm" title="You did cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,">Psalm 76:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-26.htm" title="And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.">Jeremiah 25:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm" title="Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through to you: you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.">Lamentations 4:21</a>); and then foul shame, as of a man stupefied with drink, shall take the place of glory and dignity.<p><span class= "bld">Puttest thy bottle.</span>--It is possible to render, <span class= "ital">pourest out thy wrath,</span> and this makes the metaphor less obscure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - &sect; 11. <span class="accented">The fourth woe: for base and degrading treatment of subject nations. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Not only do the Chaldeans oppress and pillage the peoples, but they expose them to the vilest derision and contumely. The prophet uses figures taken from the conduct produced by intemperance. <span class="cmt_word">That giveth his neighbour drink.</span> The Chaldeans behaved to the conquered nations like one who gives his neighbour intoxicating drink to stupefy his faculties and expose him to shame (comp. ver. 5). The literal drunkenness of the Chaldeans is not the point here. <span class="cmt_word">That puttest thy bottle to him.</span> If this translation is received, the clause is merely a strengthened repetition of the preceding with a sudden change of person. But it may be rendered, "pouring out, or mixing, thy fury," or, as Jerome, "mittens fel suum," "adding thy poison thereto." This last version seems most suitable, introducing a kind of climax, the "poison" being some drug added to increase the intoxicating power. Thus: he gives his neighbour drink, and this drugged, and in the end makes him drunken also. For the second clause the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span>, <span class="accented">subversione turbida</span> and the versions collected by Jerome are only unanimous in differing from one another That thou mayest look on their nakedness. There seems to be an allusion to the case of Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>, etc.); but the figure is meant to show the abject state to which the conquered nations were reduced, when, prostrated by fraud and treachery, they were mocked and spurned and covered with ignominy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5, 11</a>). So the mystic Babylon is said to have made the nations drink of her cup (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-20 A severe woe is pronounced against drunkenness; it is very fearful against all who are guilty of drunkenness at any time, and in any place, from the stately palace to the paltry ale-house. To give one drink who is in want, who is thirsty and poor, or a weary traveller, or ready to perish, is charity; but to give a neighbour drink, that he may expose himself, may disclose secret concerns, or be drawn into a bad bargain, or for any such purpose, this is wickedness. To be guilty of this sin, to take pleasure in it, is to do what we can towards the murder both of soul and body. There is woe to him, and punishment answering to the sin. The folly of worshipping idols is exposed. The Lord is in his holy temple in heaven, where we have access to him in the way he has appointed. May we welcome his salvation, and worship him in his earthly temples, through Christ Jesus, and by the influence of the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
