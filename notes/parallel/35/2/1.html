(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm" title="And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?">2Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm" title="And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.">2Samuel 18:24</a>.) In a yet bolder metaphor Isaiah represents himself as appointing a watchman, who brings reports from his tower. We need not suppose that Habakkuk literally betook himself to a solitary height to wait for a revelation. Balaam, the heathen soothsayer, did so (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatever he shows me I will tell you. And he went to an high place.">Numbers 23:3</a>), but his conduct throws no light on the customs of the Jewish prophets.<p><span class= "bld">What he will say unto me.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">what He will say in me, and what answer I shall make to my complaint: i.e.,</span> of what solution of the perplexities I am deploring, Jehovah shall make me the mouthpiece.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - &sect; 5. <span class="accented">The prophet, waiting for an answer to his expostulation, is bidden to write the oracle in plain characters, because its fulfilment is certain.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Habakkuk speaks with himself, and, mindful of his office, waits for the communication which he confidently ex-poets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will stand upon my watch</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6, 8</a>). As a watchman goes to a high place to see all around and discern what is coming, so the prophet places himself apart from men, perhaps in some secluded height, in readiness to hear the voice of God and seize the meaning of the coming event. Prophets are called "watchmen" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The tower;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> watch tower, either literally or metaphorically, as in the first clause. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "rook." <span class="cmt_word">What he will say unto me;</span> <span class="accented">quid dicatur mihi</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, "what he will speak in me" (Septuagint). He watches for the inward revelation which God makes to his soul (but see note on Zechariah 2:0). <span class="cmt_word">When I am reproved;</span> <span class="accented">ad arguentem me</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Septuagint); rather, <span class="accented">to my complaint</span>, referring to his complaint concerning the impunity of sinners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1.htm">Habakkuk 1</a>:18-17). He waits till he hears God's voice within him what answer he shall make to his own complaint, the expostulation which he had offered to God. There is no question here concerning the reproofs which others levelled against him, or concerning any rebuke conveyed to him by God - an impression given by the Anglican Version. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 When tossed and perplexed with doubts about the methods of Providence, we must watch against temptations to be impatient. When we have poured out complaints and requests before God, we must observe the answers God gives by his word, his Spirit, and providences; what the Lord will say to our case. God will not disappoint the believing expectations of those who wait to hear what he will say unto them. All are concerned in the truths of God's word. Though the promised favour be deferred long, it will come at last, and abundantly recompense us for waiting. The humble, broken-hearted, repenting sinner, alone seeks to obtain an interest in this salvation. He will rest his soul on the promise, and on Christ, in and through whom it is given. Thus he walks and works, as well as lives by faith, perseveres to the end, and is exalted to glory; while those who distrust or despise God's all-sufficiency will not walk uprightly with him. The just shall live by faith in these precious promises, while the performance of them is deferred. Only those made just by faith, shall live, shall be happy here and for ever.</body></html>
