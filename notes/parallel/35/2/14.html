This is cue of the passages which attests "the community of testimony," as it is called, among the prophets. To take a few out of many cases that offer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-22</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a> (Ladd, 'Doctrine of Scripture,' 1:145). All the earth is to be filled with, and to recognize, the glory of God as manifested in the overthrow of ungodliness; and therefore Babylon, and the world power of which she is a type, must be subdued and perish. This announcement looks forward to the establishment of Messiah's kingdom, which "shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and shall stand forever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). We must remember how intimately in the minds of Eastern heathens the prosperity of a nation was connected with its local deities. Nothing in their eyes could show more perfectly the impotence of a god than his failing to protect his worshippers from destruction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33</a>, etc.). The glory of Jehovah and his sovereignty over the earth would be seen and acknowledged in the overthrow of Babylon, the powerful, victorious nation. As the waters cover the sea. As the waters fill the basin of the sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-22.htm">Genesis 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>, where the great vessel of ablution is called "the sea"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-14 The prophet reads the doom of all proud and oppressive powers that bear hard upon God's people. The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.</body></html>
