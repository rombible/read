It is therefore unsound and distorted. Habakkuk leaves the inference "and therefore it shall die" to be imagined, and hastens to the antithesis, "<span class= "ital">But the righteous man shall live by his faith.</span>" The word <span class= "ital">live</span> is emphatic. The reward promised to patient waitings on God is <span class= "ital">life</span>--deliverance from destruction. How far the promise extends, and whether it includes that aspiration after future life which is plainly expressed by many Hebrew poets and prophets, we cannot determine. The student must be cautioned against such renderings as "he that is righteous-by-faith shall live," or, "he that is justified-by-faith shall live," which have been suggested by the Pauline quotations <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a>. If the adjective could be taken in this close collocation with the substantive, "he that is consistent in-his-confidence shall live" would be the only possible rendering. Thus whatever force we assign to St. Paul's citation, here, at least, the words have no doctrinal significance. Their ethical importance is, however, undeniable. (See Introduction 4)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - &sect; 6. <span class="accented">The great principle is taught that the proud shall not continue, but the just shall live by faith.</span> The prophecy commences with a fundamental thought, applicable to all God's dealings with man. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him;</span> literally, <span class="accented">behold, puffed up, his soul is not upright in him.</span> This is a description of an evil character (especially of the Chaldean) in opposition to the character delineated in the following hemistich. One who is proud, presumptuous, thinks much of himself, despising others, and is not straightforward and upright before God, shall not live, shall not have a happy, safe life; he carries in himself the seeds of destruction. The result is not expressed in the first hemistich, but may be supplied from the next clause, and, as Knabenbauer suggests, may be inferred from the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38, 39</a>, where, after quoting the Septuagint rendering of this passage, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, the writer adds, "But we are not of them that shrink back (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) unto perdition." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ecce</span>, <span class="accented">qui incredulus est, non erit recta anima ejus in semetipso</span>, which seems to confine the statement to the case of one who doubts God's word. <span class="cmt_word">But the just shall live by his faith.</span> The "faith" here spoken of is a loving trust in God, confidence in his promises, resulting in due performance of his will. This hemistich is the antithesis to the former. The proud and perverse, those who wish to be independent of God, shall perish; but, on the other hand, the righteous shall live and be saved through his faith, on the condition that he puts his trust in God. The Hebrew accents forbid the union, "the just by faith," though, of course, no one can be just, righteous, without faith. The passage may be emphasized by rendering, "As to the just, through his faith he shall live." This famous sentence, which St. Paul has used as the basis of his great argument (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>), in its literal and contextual application implies that the righteous man will have perfect trust in God's promises and will be rewarded by being safe in the day of tribulation, with reference to the coming trouble at the hands of the Chaldeans. When the proud, greedy kingdom shall have sunk in ruin, the faithful people shall live secure. But the application is not confined to this circumstance. The promise looks beyond the temporal future of the Chaldeans and Israelites, and unto a reward that is eternal. We see how naturally the principle here enunciated is applied by the apostle to teach the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ. The LXX. gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x2c;&#x3b5;&#x2e;</span> "by faith in me." The Speaker is God. St. Paul omits <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Habakkuk gathers into one sentence the whole principle of the Law, and indeed all true religion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 When tossed and perplexed with doubts about the methods of Providence, we must watch against temptations to be impatient. When we have poured out complaints and requests before God, we must observe the answers God gives by his word, his Spirit, and providences; what the Lord will say to our case. God will not disappoint the believing expectations of those who wait to hear what he will say unto them. All are concerned in the truths of God's word. Though the promised favour be deferred long, it will come at last, and abundantly recompense us for waiting. The humble, broken-hearted, repenting sinner, alone seeks to obtain an interest in this salvation. He will rest his soul on the promise, and on Christ, in and through whom it is given. Thus he walks and works, as well as lives by faith, perseveres to the end, and is exalted to glory; while those who distrust or despise God's all-sufficiency will not walk uprightly with him. The just shall live by faith in these precious promises, while the performance of them is deferred. Only those made just by faith, shall live, shall be happy here and for ever.</body></html>
