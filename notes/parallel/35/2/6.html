It is now plainly foretold in a denunciatory song, put into the mouths of the invader's victims. In this song there are five strophes, of three verses each, 6-8; 9-11; 12-14; 15-17; 18-20.<p>(6-8) Woe on the reckless rapacity which has spared neither life nor property.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">How long?</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> how long shall this continual annexation be witnessed?<p><span class= "bld">That ladeth himself with thick clay.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">That accumulates to himself usury.</span> So the Targum. The rendering "thick clay" originates in a false etymology of the word <span class= "ital">abtet,</span> which the student will find in Rashi's <span class= "ital">Commentary.</span> For the true derivation see Frst's Lexicon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - &sect; 8. The <span class="accented">destruction of the Babylonians is announced by the mouth of the vanquished nations, who utter five woes against their oppressor. The first woe: for their rapacity.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All these.</span> All the nations and peoples who have been subjugated and barbarously treated by the Babylonians (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A parable.</span> A sententious song (see note on Micah 2:4). <span class="cmt_word">A taunting proverb</span>. The Anglican Version combines the two Hebrew words, which stand unconnected, into one notion. So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">loquelam aenigmatum.</span> The latter of the two generally means "riddle," "enigma;" the other word (<span class="accented">melitzah</span>) is by some translated, "a derisive satirical song," or "an obscure, dark saying;" but, as Keil and Delitzsch have shown, is better understood of a bright, clear, brilliant speech. So the two terms signify "a speech containing enigmas," or a song which has double or ambiguous meanings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-6.htm">Proverbs 1:6</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Woe</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>). This is the first of the five "woes," which consist of three verses each, arranged in strophical form. Increaseth that which is not his. He continues to add to his conquests and possessions, which are not his, because they are acquired by injustice and violence. This is the first denunciation of the Chaldeans for their insatiable rapacity. <span class="cmt_word">How long?</span> The question comes in interjectionally - How long is this state of things to continue unpunished (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-3.htm">Psalm 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">That ladeth himself with thick clay;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, "who loadeth his yoke heavily;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">aggravat contra se densum lutum.</span> The renderings of the Anglican and Latin Versions signify that the riches and spoils with which the conquerors load themselves are no more than burdens of clay, which are in themselves worthless, and only harass the bearers. The Greek Version seems to point to the weight of the yoke imposed by the Chaldeans on them; but Jerome explains it differently, "Ad hoc tantum saevit ut devoret et iniquitatis et praedarum onere quasi gravissima torque se deprimat." The difficulty lies in the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;</span>, which forms an enigma, or dark saying, because, taken as two words, it might pass current for "thick clay," or "a mass of dirt," while regarded as one word it means "a mass of pledges," "many pledges." That the latter is the signification primarily intended is the view of many modern commentators, who explain the clause thus: The quantity of treasure and booty amassed by the Chaldeans is regarded as a mass of pledges taken from the conquered nations a burden of debt to be discharged one day with heavy retribution. Pusey, "He does in truth <span class="accented">increase against himself a strong pledge</span>, whereby not others are debtors to him, but he is a debtor to Almighty God, who careth for the oppressed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>)." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:5-14 The prophet reads the doom of all proud and oppressive powers that bear hard upon God's people. The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.</body></html>
