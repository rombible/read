Heb. <span class= "ital">amal,</span> associated again with <span class= "ital">aven,</span> a term of similar import, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-7.htm" title="His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.">Psalm 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-11.htm" title="Wickedness is in the middle thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.">Psalm 55:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why dost thou show me</span> - <span class="accented">Why dost thou let me see</span> daily with my own eyes - iniquity abounding, the very evil which Balaam says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a>) the Lord had not found in Israel? <span class="cmt_word">Cause me to behold grievance.</span> This should be, <span class="accented">Dost thou look upon perverseness?</span> He asks how God can look on this evil and leave it unpunished. The LXX. and the Vulgate translate the word <span class="accented">amal</span> "trouble," or "labour;" Keil, "distress." In this case it means the trouble and distress which a man inflicts on others, as wrong doing seems to be generally spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">Spoiling and violence are before me.</span> "Spoiling" is robbery that causes desolation. "Violence" is conduct that wrongs one's neighbour. The two words are often joined; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>. Vulgate, <span class="accented">praedam et injustitiam.</span> These are continually coming before the prophet's eyes. <span class="cmt_word">There are that raise up strife and contention;</span> better, <span class="accented">there is strife, and contention is raised.</span> This refers to the abuse of the Law by grasping, quarrelsome nobles. Septuagint, "Against me judgment hath gone, and the judge receiveth bribes." So the Syriac and Arabic. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Factum est judicium, et contradictio potentior</span>, where <span class="accented">judicium</span> is used in a bad sense. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness and violence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. The closing words give a glimpse of comfort.</body></html>
