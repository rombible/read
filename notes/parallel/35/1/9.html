If the word <span class= "ital">kadimah</span> could be translated "east wind," the invading Chaldaean host would be compared to a blast from the east, passing over the land, and leaving it scorched and blighted. The captives ("captivity," Authorised Version) whom the invader carries off would then be likened to the cloud of dust, sand, &c., which accompanies this withering blast. This gives a good sense. Unfortunately, however, according to all analogy, <span class= "ital">kadimah</span> must mean either "eastwards" or "forwards." The meaning of <span class= "ital">m</span>'<span class= "ital">gammath</span> (used here only) is probably either "crowd" or "eager desire." Two plausible renderings are thus presented for our choice--"There is a crowd of their faces pressing forwards;" "Their faces turn eagerly forwards." For other interpretations, we must refer the Hebrew student to the critical commentaries.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall come all for violence.</span> All, every one of the invaders, come for violence - to repay that violence of which Habakkuk complained (ver. 2). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "An end shall come upon the impious;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Omnes ad praedam venient. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Their faces shall sup up as the east wind.</span> The word translated "shall sup up" occasions perplexity, being an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The Anglican rendering is virtually supported by other versions, e.g. Symmachus, Chaldee, and Syriac. The Vulgate, too, gives, <span class="accented">facies eorum ventus urens</span>, which Jerome explains, "As at the blast of a burning wind all green things dry up, so at the sight of these men all shall be wasted." This is the meaning of the Anglican Version, which, however, might be improved thus: <span class="accented">The aspect of their faces is as the east wind.</span> The Revisers have, <span class="accented">Their faces are set eagerly as the east wind</span>, which does not seem very intelligible. Other renderings are, "the endeavour," or "desire of their faces is directed to the east," or "forwards." (This rendering has the support of Orelli and others.) "The crowd of their faces," as equivalent to "the multitude of the army" which is not a Hebrew phrase found elsewhere. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (agreeing with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in the first clause) <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "resisting with their adverse front." The effects of the east wind are often noted in Scripture; e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-6.htm">Genesis 41:6, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They shall gather the captivity as the sand.</span> "He collects the captives as sand" - a hyperbolical expression to denote the numbers of captives and the quantity of booty taken. The mention of the east wind brings the thought of the terrible simoom, with its columns of sand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness and violence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. The closing words give a glimpse of comfort.</body></html>
