The rest of the verse runs literally, <span class= "ital">Jehovah, for judgment hast Thou appointed him, and O Rock, for chastisement hast Thou founded him.</span> "Him," means, of course, the Chaldaean invader, whom Habakkuk regards as raised up only to be God's instrument of correction. The term "<span class= "ital">Rock</span>" has been paraphrased in the Authorised Version. Used absolutely, it occurs as a Divine title in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>.

An affirmative answer is expected. This is one ground of confidence in the corrective nature of the chastisement. God is Jehovah, the covenant God, who has been in personal relation to Israel from time immemorial, and is himself eternal. <span class="cmt_word">Mine Holy One</span>. He speaks in the person of the righteous people, and he refers to God's holiness as a second ground of hope, because, although God must punish sin, he will not let the sacred nation, the chosen guardian of the faith, perish utterly. And then he expresses this confidence: <span class="cmt_word">We shall not die.</span> We shall be chastened, but not killed. The Masorites assert that the present reading is a correction of the scribes for "thou wilt not die," which the prophet wrote originally, and which was altered for reverence' sake. But this is a mere assumption, incapable of proof. Its adoption would be an omission of the very consolation to which the prophet's confidence leads. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast ordained them</span> (<span class="accented">him</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for judgment.</span> Thou hast appointed the Chaldean to execute thy corrective punishment on Israel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-28.htm">Jeremiah 46:28</a>).

Thou appointedst the Chaldean, or madest him strong, in order to correct thy people. He is, like the Assyrian, the rod of God's anger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>).

This, says St. Jerome, is spoken in the person of the prophet announcing his call and office. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-17 However matters may be, yet God is the Lord our God, our Holy One. We are an offending people, he is an offended God, yet we will not entertain hard thoughts of him, or of his service. It is great comfort that, whatever mischief men design, the Lord designs good, and we are sure that his counsel shall stand. Though wickedness may prosper a while, yet God is holy, and does not approve the wickedness. As he cannot do iniquity himself, so he is of purer eyes than to behold it with any approval. By this principle we must abide, though the dispensations of his providence may for a time, in some cases, seem to us not to agree with it. The prophet complains that God's patience was abused; and because sentence against these evil works and workers was not executed speedily, their hearts were the more fully set in them to do evil. Some they take up as with the angle, one by one; others they catch in shoals, as in their net, and gather them in their drag, their enclosing net. They admire their own cleverness and contrivance: there is great proneness in us to take the glory of outward prosperity to ourselves. This is idolizing ourselves, sacrificing to the drag-net because it is our own. God will soon end successful and splendid robberies. Death and judgment shall make men cease to prey on others, and they shall be preyed on themselves. Let us remember, whatever advantages we possess, we must give all the glory to God.</body></html>
