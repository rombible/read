Compare Nebuchadnezzar's treatment of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-6.htm">2 Chronicles 36:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>) and Jehoiachin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall deride every strong hold.</span> The strongest fortress is no impediment to them. <span class="cmt_word">They shall heap dust.</span> This refers to the raising of a mound or embankment for the purpose of attacking a city (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>). In the Assyrian monuments one often sees representations of these mounds, or of inclined planes constructed to facilitate the approach of the battering ram (see Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Palaces,' pp. 181, 188, etc.; Layard, 'Nineveh,' etc., 2:369). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness and violence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. The closing words give a glimpse of comfort.</body></html>
