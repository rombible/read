The appearance, character, and operations of these invaders are described.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Among the heathen.</span>--These words are emphatic. They imply--Jehovah will no longer manifest Himself among His chosen people, but among the Gentiles. Let them look abroad, and they shall see Him using the Chaldaeans as His instrument for their own chastisement. They are to "wonder," not at God's choice of an agent, but at the consequences of the visitation, which resulted in the sack of the Temple, and the deportation of 10,000 captives; a work which the Jews might well not have credited, though it were told them. The words "among the heathen" (<span class= "ital">bag-goyim</span>) were, probably, misread by the LXX. translators <span class= "ital">bog</span>'<span class= "ital">dim.</span> Hence the translation, <span class= "greekheb">????????????</span>, "ye despisers." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-41.htm" title="Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it to you.">Acts 13:41</a> St. Paul is represented as citing the verse in its LXX. form, as a warning to his Jewish hearers at Antioch. This citation, of course, gives no authority whatever to the variant. Nor is it certain that St. Paul did not actually quote the Hebrew form of the verse, which would seem more appropriate to the circumstances than the other. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-42.htm" title="And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles sought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.">Acts 13:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> That St. Luke should substitute the Greek variant is intelligible enough.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-11.</span> - &sect; 3. <span class="accented">To this appeal answers that he will send the Chaldeans to punish the evil doers with a terrible vengeance</span>; <span class="accented">but rinse, his instruments, shall themselves offend by pride and impiety.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold ye among the heathen;</span> <span class="accented">the nations</span>. God, in answer, bids the prophet and his people look among the nations for those who shall punish the iniquities of which he complains. I will use a heathen nation, he says, as my instrument to chastise the sinners in Judaea; and you shall see that I have not disregarded the evil that is rife among you. Some commentators suppose that the impious are addressed; but Habakkuk spoke in the name and person of the righteous, and to them the answer must be directed.

St. Paul quotes the Greek Version, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-41.htm">Acts 13:41</a>, in his sermon at Antioch in the Jewish synagogue, warning those who despised the gospel This was sufficiently close to the Hebrew for his purpose. <span class="cmt_word">And regard, and wonder marvellously.</span> They are to wonder because the work is as terrible as it is unexpected. The LXX. (quoted by St. Paul, <span class="accented">loc</span>. <span class="accented">cit.</span>) adds, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "and perish," or rather, "be stupefied by astonishment," die of amazement. <span class="cmt_word">I will work;</span> <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">work.</span> The pronoun is not expressed, but must be supplied from ver. 6. It is God who sends the avengers. <span class="cmt_word">In your days. T</span>he prophet had asked (ver. 2), "How long?" The answer is that those now living should see the chastisement (see Introduction, &sect; III.). <span class="cmt_word">Which ye will not believe.</span> If ye heard of it as happening elsewhere, ye would not give credit to it; the punishment itself and its executors are both unexpected (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness and violence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. The closing words give a glimpse of comfort.</body></html>
