The ideas intended are those of activity and ferocity, both prompted by hunger. The evening wolf coming out of his lair to find prey is elsewhere an illustration of ravenous greediness. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm" title="Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.">Zephaniah 3:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm" title="Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, does hear?">Psalm 59:7</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm" title="Why a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goes out there shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.">Jeremiah 5:6</a> God's punishment is likened to "a wolf of the evening," "a lion out of the forest." <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-13.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! for we are spoiled.">Jeremiah 4:13</a> "his chariots shall be as a whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles," is similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm" title="Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, but it is not necessary to regard it either as its original or its echo. Both passages are to some extent based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm" title="Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.">2Samuel 1:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their horses,</span> etc. Jeremiah (Jeremiah 4:13) compares their horses to eagles (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19</a>, etc.). The punishment predicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, etc., is to come upon the Jews. We often read of the cavalry and chariots of the Chaldeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-23.htm">Jeremiah 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23, 24</a>). Evening wolves. Wolves that prowl for food in the evening, and are then fiercest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>). Septuagint (with a different pointing), "wolves of Arabia." Their horsemen shall spread themselves. The verb is also rendered, "bear themselves proudly," or "gallop." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Anglican Version seems correct implying that the cavalry, like Cossacks or Uhlans, swept the whole country for plunder. The verbs throughout vers. 8-11 should be rendered in the present tense. <span class="cmt_word">From far</span>. From Babylonia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3</a>). The preceding clause was of general import; the present one refers to the invasion of Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">As the eagle.</span> This is a favourite comparison of Jeremiah, as quoted above (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness and violence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. The closing words give a glimpse of comfort.</body></html>
