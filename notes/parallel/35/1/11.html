But he is guilty, making this his strength his god.</span> By an abrupt transition the latter half of the verse diverts our attention from the human view of the world-conqueror to his appearance in God's sight. Men only see an irresistible force sweeping over the face of the earth like a whirlwind; here to-day, and to-morrow nothing but devastation and ruin to testify to its visit. And men are dazzled by this mighty display of power. But, even as Daniel at Belshazzar's feast, Habakkuk pronounces the oppressor's doom in the very hour of triumph. The description of the irresistible invader drops into the sudden depths of anti-climax, "But he is (counted) <span class= "ital">guilty.</span>" His guilt consists just in what men deem so glorious, in his self-reliant irresponsible pursuit of grandeur. The brute force of armaments is the supreme deity of the Chaldaean. His sword and spear are, as it were, his idols. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-16.htm" title="Therefore they sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.">Habakkuk 1:16</a>.) God, in whose hands his breath is, and whose are all his ways, has he not glorified. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-23.htm" title="But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, have you not glorified:">Daniel 5:23</a>.) Therefore that God shall bring on him ruin and ignominy, and the very nations which have marvelled at his prowess shall taunt and contemn him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm" title="Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increases that which is not his! how long? and to him that lades himself with thick clay!">Habakkuk 2:6</a>). Here, then, is the key-note of so much of the second canto (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm" title="Are you not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, you have ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, you have established them for correction.">Habakkuk 1:12</a> to 2 <span class= "ital">fin.</span>) as relates to the downfall of the invader.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall his mind change;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Tunc mutabitur spiritus</span> (Vulgate). From the ease and extent of his conquests the Chaldean gains fresh spirit. But it is best to translate differently, <span class="accented">Then he sweepeth on as a wind.</span> The Chaldean's inroad is compared to a tempestuous wind, which carries all before it. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall pass over.</span> This is explained to mean, he exceeds all limits in his arrogancy, or he passes onward through the land. The former interpretation regards what is coming, the latter keeps to the metaphor of the wind. <span class="cmt_word">And offend.</span> He is guilty, or offends, as the next clause explains, by attributing his success to his own prowess and skill. Thus the prophet intimates that the avenger himself incurs God's displeasure, and will suffer for it. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which St. Cyril interprets to mean that the Lord will change his purpose of punishing the Jews, and will have mercy on them - a notion quite foreign to the purport of the sentence. <span class="cmt_word">Imputing this his power unto his god;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">this his power is his god</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">even he whose might is his god</span>. He defies the Lord, and makes his might his god. (For such pride and self-glorification, setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-7.htm">Isaiah 47:7</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>.) Thus Mezentius, the despiser of the gods, speaks in Virgil, 'AEn.,' 10:773 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Dextra mihi deus et telum, quod missile libro,<br />Nunc adsint!"</span> Comp. Statius, 'Theb.,' 3:615 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Virtus mihi numen, et ensis, Quem teneo."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness and violence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. The closing words give a glimpse of comfort.</body></html>
