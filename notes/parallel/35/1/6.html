The phrase implies that the Chaldaeans were not yet in Judaea, but there is no occasion to find an allusion to the recent rise of the Chaldaean nation. We notice this point because an ethnological theory (now generally abandoned) has regarded the Chaldaeans of the prophetic period as raised to national existence only a little time before the date of Habakkuk. It was supposed that they were a race distinct from the Chaldaeans of earlier Scripture; being, in fact, an association of northern hordes who had but recently penetrated the lower Mesopotamian valley. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm" title="For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs.">Habakkuk 1:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-13.htm" title="Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.">Isaiah 23:13</a> were therefore interpreted as illustrating the fact that these new nationalities "were on a sudden 'raised up,' elevated from their low estate of Assyrian colonists, to be the conquering people which they became under Nebuchadnezzar." The confutation of this theory may be found in Rawlinson's <span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies,</span> i. 57, 59. It appears that Babylon was peopled at this time, not, as was formerly supposed, with hordes of Armenians, Arabs, Kurds, and Sclaves, but with a mixed population, in which the old Chaldaean and Assyrian elements preponderated. The Chaldaeans of the seventh century B.C. were, in fact, as legitimate descendants of the people of Nimrod's empire as we are of the Saxons. Certainly, the rapidity with which Babylon rose from the position of an Assyrian colony to that of ruler of Asia was marvellous. But the work which is to make the Jews wonder is not God's choice of an agent, but that agent's proceeding; not the elevation of one Gentile power in the place of another, but the attack which that new power is to make upon the sacred city.<p><span class= "bld">Bitter and hasty</span>.--Better, <span class= "ital">fierce and impetuous.</span> The association of these two epithets, <span class= "ital">mar</span> and <span class= "ital">nimhar,</span> is the more forcible, because of their similarity in sound. With respect to the whole passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/habakkuk/1-6.htm" title="For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs.">Habakkuk 1:6-11</a>, Kleinert well remarks, "The present passage is the <span class= "ital">locus classicus</span> for the characteristics of this warlike people, just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-26.htm" title="And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:">Isaiah 5:26</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span> is for the characteristics of the Assyrians."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The executors of the Divine vengeance are now plainly announced. <span class="cmt_word">I raise up.</span> God does it; he uses the power and passion of men to work out his designs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Chaldeans</span>; <span class="accented">Kasidim.</span> By this appellation the prophets signify the soldiers or inhabitants of Babylon, which won its independence and commenced its wonderfully rapid career of conquest after the tall of Nineveh, between <span class="date">B.C. 626</span> and 608. At the time when Habakkuk wrote the Chaldeans had not appeared in Judaea, and no apprehension of danger from them was entertained. <span class="cmt_word">Bitter and hasty.</span> The former epithet refers to their cruelty and ferocity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-6.htm">Isaiah 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-23.htm">Jeremiah 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-42.htm">Jeremiah 50:42</a>).

The statement explains the general character of the Chaldeans, and points to the foreign conquests of Nebuchadnezzar.

No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. The closing words give a glimpse of comfort.</body></html>
