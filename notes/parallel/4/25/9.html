It has been supposed that a thousand were put to death by the judges, and that these were not included in St. Paul's enumeration. Presuming, however, that there has been no error in either place on the part of the scribes in recording the numbers, the words "in one day" may account for the apparent discrepancy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Were twenty and four thousand.</span> "Fell in one day three and twenty thousand," says St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>). As the Septuagint does not deviate here from the Hebrew, the Apostle must have followed some Rabbinical tradition. It is possible enough that the odd thousand died on some other day than the one of which he speaks, or they may have died by the hands of the judges, and not by the plague. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:6-15 Phinehas, in the courage of zeal and faith, executed vengeance on Zimri and Cozbi.
