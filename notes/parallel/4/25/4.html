He may have been absent from the camp on account of the wars with the Amorite kings; or he may have trusted to the chiefs to see that due order and discipline was maintained in the camps. <span class="cmt_word">Take all the heads of the people,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the chiefs, who ought to have prevented, and might have prevented, this monstrous irregularity, but who seem, if we may judge from the case of Zimri, to have countenanced it. The mere neglect of duty in so gross a case was reason enough for summary execution. <span class="cmt_word">Hang them up before the Lord.</span> Either by way of impalement or by way of crucifixion, both of which were familiar modes of punishment. In this case the guilty persons were probably slain first, and exposed afterwards. The hanging up was not ordered on account of its cruelty, nor merely for the sake of publicity ("against the sun ), but in order to show that the victims were devoted to the wrath of God against sin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-2.htm">2 Samuel 21:2-6</a>).

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm">Hebrews 6:6</a>, where this word is coupled with "crucify." Them is no authority for referring the "them" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>) to the guilty persons instead of to the heads of the people, as is done by the Targums and by many commentators. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-5 The friendship of the wicked is more dangerous than their enmity; for none can prevail against God's people if they are not overcome by their inbred lusts; nor can any enchantment hurt them, but the enticements of worldly interests and pleasures. Here is the sin of Israel, to which they are enticed by the daughters of Moab and Midian. Those are our worst enemies who draw us to sin, for that is the greatest mischief any man can do us. Israel's sin did that which all Balaam's enchantments could not do; it set God against them. Diseases are the fruits of God's anger, and the just punishments of prevailing sins; one infection follows the other. Ringleaders in sin ought to be made examples of justice.</body></html>
