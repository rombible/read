There can be little doubt that Peor (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to open) has the sense of <span class="accented">aperiens, in usu obsceno</span>, and that it was the distinguishing name of Baal or Chemosh when worshipped as the god of reproduction with the abominable rites proper to this cultus. For a notice of the same thing in the last days of Israel see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-14.htm">Hosea 4:14</a>, and for the practice of Babylonian and (to some degree) Egyptian women, see Herodotus, 1:199; 2:60).

Here is the sin of Israel, to which they are enticed by the daughters of Moab and Midian. Those are our worst enemies who draw us to sin, for that is the greatest mischief any man can do us. Israel's sin did that which all Balaam's enchantments could not do; it set God against them. Diseases are the fruits of God's anger, and the just punishments of prevailing sins; one infection follows the other. Ringleaders in sin ought to be made examples of justice.</body></html>
