The same word occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>, in the phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, which is usually rendered "a stone image," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a stone shaped into some likeness of man. If so, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> by itself has probably the same meaning; at any rate it can hardly be "a picture," nor is there the least evidence that the art of painting was at all practiced among the rude tribes of' Canaan. The same word, <span class="accented">maskith</span>, is indeed found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a> in connection with "gravings" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-16.htm">Isaiah 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a>) on a wall; but even this belonged to a very different age. <span class="cmt_word">Their molten images,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, "images cast of brass." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> The word <span class="accented">tselem</span> is only elsewhere used in the Pentateuch for that "likeness" which is reproduced in Divine creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>) or in human generation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-3.htm">Genesis 5:3</a>); in the later books, however (especially in Daniel), it is freely used for idols. On <span class="accented">"massakah,"</span> see on Exodus 32:4; Isaiah 30:22. Their high places. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>. See on Leviticus 26:30. The Septuagint translates Bamoth in both places by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and of course it was not the high places themselves, which were simply certain prominent elevations, but the monuments (of whatever kind) which superstition had erected upon them, which were to be plucked down. As a fact, it would seem that the Jews, instead of obeying this command, appropriated the Bamoth to their own religious uses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a>, etc.). The natural result was, as in all similar cases, that not only the Bamoth, but very many of the superstitions and idolatries connected with them, were taken over into the service of the Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:50-56 Now that they were to pass over Jordan, they were entering again into temptation to follow idols; and they are threatened that, if they spared either the idols or the idolaters, their sin would certainly be their punishment. They would foster vipers in their own bosoms. The remnant of the Canaanites, if they made any peace with them, though but for a time, would be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides. We must expect trouble and affliction from whatever sin we indulge; that which we are willing should tempt us, will vex us. It was intended that the Canaanites should be put out of the land; but if the Israelites learned their wicked ways, they also would be put out. Let us hear this and fear. If we do not drive out sin, sin will drive us out. If we are not the death of our lusts, our lusts will be the death of our souls.</body></html>
