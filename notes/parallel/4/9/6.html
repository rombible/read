Coincidences," pp. 66, 67,1850). If the consecration of Aaron and his sons began on the first day of the first month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-2.htm" title="On the first day of the first month shall you set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.">Exodus 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-12.htm" title="And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.">Exodus 40:12</a>), and the death of Nadab and Abihu could not have taken place until the eighth day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;">Leviticus 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-12.htm" title="And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled round about on the altar.">Leviticus 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-19.htm" title="And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?">Leviticus 10:19</a>), inasmuch as the defilement caused by contact with the dead lasted for seven days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm" title="He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:11</a>), it will follow, if this law was already in force, that those who buried Nadab and Abihu must have been unclean on the fourteenth day of the first month. Independently, then, of the doubtful inference which Professor Blunt draws from the identity of the numbers of the other tribes at the two numberings taken, the one before and the other after this time, from which he concludes that the deaths must have occurred amongst those who belonged to the tribe of Levi, which was not included in the census, this circumstance may fairly be adduced as one of the numerous undesigned coincidences with which Holy Scripture abounds. It may be observed further that, whilst reference would naturally be made to Moses on all doubtful occasions, none would be so likely to have recourse to him with the inquiry contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-7.htm" title="And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?">Numbers 9:7</a> as those who had been employed by his direction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-4.htm" title="And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.">Leviticus 10:4</a>) in the burial of Nadab and Abihu. The law contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-21.htm" title="Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.">Leviticus 7:21</a> appears to have been understood to refer to all sacrificial meals. The legal uncleanness which disqualified the Israelites for participation in the Passover may be regarded as typical of the moral and spiritual disqualifications which render men unfit for participation in the Lord's Supper.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were certain men.</span> It has been supposed by many that these men must have been Mishael and Elizaphan, who had recently (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-4.htm">Leviticus 10:4</a>) been defiled by burying their cousins Nadab and Abihu. This, however, is based upon the assumption that the totals given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-26.htm">Exodus 38:26</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a> are really independent, and that therefore no one belonging to any other tribe than that of Levi had died in the interval. As that assumption is untenable (see above on chapter Numbers 1:46), so this "coincidence" falls to the ground. We know indeed that Mishael and Elizaphan were defiled at this time, and we do not know that any one else was; but, on the other hand, the words "the dead body of a man" seem to point to a single corpse only. <span class="cmt_word">Dead body.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-11.htm">Numbers 6:11</a>, and other places. It is inexplicable how this word, which properly means "soul," should have come to be used of a corpse; perhaps it is an additional testimony to the complete absence from Jewish teaching of any doctrine of an immortal spirit. The Septuagint uses <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;</span> here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-14 God gave particular orders for the keeping of this passover, and, for aught that appears, after this, they kept no passover till they came to Canaan, Jos 5:10. It early showed that the ceremonial institutions were not to continue always, as so soon after they were appointed, some were suffered to sleep for many years. But the ordinance of the Lord's Supper was not thus set aside in the first days of the Christian church, although those were days of greater difficulty and distress than Israel knew in the wilderness; nay, in the times of persecution, the Lord's Supper was celebrated more frequently than afterward. Israelites in the wilderness could not forget the deliverance out of Egypt. There was danger of this when they came to Canaan. Instructions were given concerning those who were ceremonially unclean, when they were to eat the passover. Those whose minds and consciences are defiled by sin, are unfit for communion with God, and cannot partake with comfort of the gospel passover, till they are cleansed by true repentance and faith. Observe with what trouble and concern these men complained that they were kept back from offering to the Lord. It should be a trouble to us, when by any occasion we are kept back from the solemnities of a sabbath or a sacrament. Observe the deliberation of Moses in resolving this case. Ministers must ask counsel of God's mouth, not determine according to their own fancy or affection, but according to the word of God to the best of their knowledge. And if, in difficult cases, time is taken to spread the matter before God by humble, believing prayer, the Holy Spirit assuredly will direct in the good and right way. God gave directions in this case, and in other similar cases, explanatory of the law of the passover. As those who, against their minds, are forced to absent themselves from God's ordinances, may expect the favours of God's grace under their affliction, so those who, of choice, absent themselves, may expect God's wrath for their sin. Be not deceived: God is not mocked.</body></html>
