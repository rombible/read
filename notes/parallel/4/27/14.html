The same word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">quomodo</span>, is used here as in the previous clause. <span class="cmt_word">That is</span> <span class="cmt_word">the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.</span> These words have all the appearance of an explanatory gloss intended to make the reference more plain to the reader or hearer. It is impossible to suppose that they formed part of the Divine message; nor does it seem probable that Moses would have added them to the narrative as it stands, because, in view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>, no necessity for explanation existed. It is quite possible that both <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a> and the present clause are subsequent additions to the text intended to clear up an obvious confusion between the "strife" at Rephidim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>) and that at Kadesh. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:12-14 Moses must die, but he shall have the satisfaction of seeing the land of promise. This sight of Canaan signified his believing prospect of the better country, that is, the heavenly. Moses must die, but death does not cut him off; it only brings him to rest with the holy patriarchs. It is but to die as they died, having lived as they lived; and as their end was peace, why should we fear any evil in the passage of that dark valley?</body></html>
