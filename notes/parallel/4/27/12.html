They were to enter into the land of promise, and their descendants were to inherit it. The great lawgiver himself was to be excluded on account of his transgression. He does not, however, shrink from recording the sentence of exclusion in immediate connection with an incident which brings out that exclusion into greater prominence. The fulfilment of the announcement made to Moses is related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/32-48.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses that selfsame day, saying,">Deuteronomy 32:48-52</a>. The mountains of Abarim form the Moabitish table-land, the northern portion of which bore the name of Pisgah. It is here that we must look for Mount Nebo, which is sometimes described as one of the mountains of Abarim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-49.htm" title="Get you up into this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession:">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>), and at other times as the top of Pisgah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-27.htm" title="Get you up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.">Deuteronomy 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-1.htm" title="And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho.

It must not be overlooked, however, that, although he was shut out during his lifetime from entering into the land of Canaan, Moses was permitted to stand with Elijah upon the Mount of Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-3.htm" title="And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.">Matthew 17:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Moses.

It would appear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-1.htm">Numbers 31:1</a> that the war with the Midianites occurred later, and certainly the address to the people and to Joshua in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-1.htm">Deuteronomy 31:1-8</a> presupposes the formal appointment here recorded; but the chronologer of the concluding chapters of Numbers is evidently very uncertain; they may, or may not, be arranged in order of time. We may with good reason suppose that the summons to die was only separated from its fulfillment by the brief interval necessary to complete what work was yet unfinished (such as the punishment of the Midianites and the provisional settlement of the trans-Jordanic country) before the river was crossed.
