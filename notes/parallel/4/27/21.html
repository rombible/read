Moses was as much above the priests as he was above the tribe princes; but Joshua was only the civil and military head of the nation, and was as much subordinate to the high priest in one way as the high priest was subordinate to him in another. In after times no doubt the political headship quite overpowered and overshadowed the ecclesiastical, but this does not seem to have been so intended, or to have been the case in Eleazar's lifetime. Who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord. Rather, "who shall inquire for him in the judgment of Urim." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

The Urim of this passage and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a> seems identical with the Urim and Thummim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-8.htm">Leviticus 8:8</a>. What it actually was, and how it was used in con-suiting God, is not told us in Scripture, and has left no reliable trace in the tradition of the Jews; it must, therefore, remain for ever an insoluble mystery. It does not appear that Moses ever sought the judgment of Urim, for he possessed more direct means of ascertaining the will of God; nor does it seem ever to have been resorted to after the time of David, for the "more sure word of prophecy" superseded it. Its real use, therefore, belonged to the dark ages of Israel, after the light of Moses had set, and before the light of the prophets had arisen. At his word. Literally, after his mouth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the decision of Eleazar, given after consulting God by means of the Urim (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:15-23 Envious spirits do not love their successors; but Moses was not one of these. We should concern ourselves, both in our prayers and in our endeavours, for the rising generation, that religion may be maintained and advanced, when we are in our graves. God appoints a successor, even Joshua; who had signalized himself by his courage in fighting Amalek, his humility in ministering to Moses, and his faith and sincerity in witnessing against the report of the evil spies. This man God appoints to succeed Moses; a man in whom is the Spirit, the Spirit of grace. He is a good man, fearing God and hating covetousness, and acting from principle. He has the spirit of government; he is fit to do the work and discharge the trusts of his place. He has a spirit of conduct and courage; he had also the Spirit of prophecy. That man is not fully qualified for any service in the church of Christ, who is destitute of the graces and gifts of the Holy Spirit, whatever human abilities he may possess. And in Joshua's succession we are reminded that the law was given by Moses, who by reason of our transgression could not bring us to heaven; but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, for the salvation of every believer.</body></html>
