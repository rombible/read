and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.">Numbers 15:30</a>). (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:">Leviticus 4:2</a> and Note.) Provision had already been made in Leviticus 4 for sins of commission committed unwittingly by the whole congregation, but no provision appears to have been made for the guilt contracted in the case of sins of omission. It is possible, also, that in this place transgressions committed by an individual, but affecting the whole of the congregation, may be included. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm" title="When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:14</a> a young bullock is appointed as a sin offering; in the present case a young bullock is appointed for a burnt offering and a kid of the goats for a sin offering. It must be remembered, moreover, that the commandments delivered in this chapter have express reference to the land of Canaan, whereas many of the commandments previously delivered had already become obligatory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">ought be committed.</span> Rather, "if it be committed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the non-observance of "all these commandments." It cannot, however, be necessary to suppose that a falling away from the whole body of the Mosaic legislation is here intended; such an apostasy could not happen by oversight, and if it did, the remedy provided would seem much too slight for the occasion. The analogy of the provision which follows (verse 27), and of the parallel provisions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2, 13</a>, points clearly to the neglect of any one of the Divine commandments. <span class="cmt_word">One</span> <span class="cmt_word">young bullock for a burnt offering.</span> In the case of a sin of commission done ignorantly, the bullock was treated as a sin offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14, 20</a>), for in that case the expiation of guilt incurred is the prominent point in the atonement; in this case it is the necessity of a fresh self-dedication to the Lord. According to the manner, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span>, according to the ordinance given above. <span class="cmt_word">One kid of the goats for a sin offering.</span> This was no doubt offered first, because expiation must precede self-oblation, but the bullock is mentioned first as forming the principal part of the sacrifice.

David prayed to be cleansed from his secret faults, those sins which he himself was not aware of. Sins committed ignorantly, shall be forgiven through Christ the great Sacrifice, who, when he offered up himself once for all upon the cross, seemed to explain one part of the intention of his offering, in that prayer, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. It looked favourably upon the Gentiles, that this law of atoning for sins of ignorance, is expressly made to extend to those who were strangers to Israel.</body></html>
