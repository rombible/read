Great sanctity was attached to these fringes or tassels, and for this cause the woman with the issue of blood desired to touch a <span class= "ital">kraspedon </span>of our Saviour's garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm" title="And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:">Matthew 9:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bid them that they make them fringes.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>, probably tassels. It seems to signify something flower-like and bright, like the blooms on a shrub; the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;</span>. is applied to the shining plate of gold upon Aaron's head-band (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-9.htm">Jeremiah 48:9</a> it seems to mean a wing, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span> is a lock of hair. The exact meaning must be gathered from the context, and on the whole that suggests a tassel rather than a fringe. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span>, used in the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>, seems to have this meaning. The Septuagint renders it by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, which is adopted in the Gospels (see on Matthew 23:5). <span class="cmt_word">In the borders of their garments.</span> Literally, "on the wings," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. The outer garment (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> here, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>) was worn like a plaid, so folded that the four <span class="accented">corners</span> were dependent, and on each of these corners was to be hung a tassel. It was also used as a coverlet by the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband</span> <span class="cmt_word">of blue.</span> Rather, "that they put a string (or thread) of hyacinth-blue upon the tassel of the wing." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. This may have been a blue string with which to fasten the tassel to the corner of the garment, as if it were the stalk on which this flower grew; or it may have been a prominent blue thread in the tassel itself. The later Jews seem to have understood it in this sense, and concerned themselves greatly with the symbolical arrangements of the blue and other threads, and the method in which they were knotted together, so as to set forth the whole law with all its several commandments. The later Jews, however, have always contrived, with all their minute observance, to break the plain letter of the law: thus the modern <span class="accented">talith</span> is an under, and not an upper, garment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:37-41 The people are ordered by the Lord to make fringes on the borders of their garments. The Jews were distinguished from their neighbours in their dress, as well as in their diet, and thus taught not to be conformed to the way of the heathen in other things. They proclaimed themselves Jews wherever they were, as not ashamed of God and his law. The fringes were not appointed for trimming and adorning their clothes, but to stir up their minds by way of remembrance, 2Pe 3:1. If they were tempted to sin, the fringe would warn them not to break God's commandments. We should use every means of refreshing our memories with the truths and precepts of God's word, to strengthen and quicken our obedience, and arm our minds against temptation. Be holy unto your God; cleansed from sin, and sincerely devoted to his service; and that great reason for all the commandments is again and again repeated, I am the Lord your God.</body></html>
