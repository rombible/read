A similar phrase is used of God himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The same reproacheth the Lord,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>, revileth. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-27.htm">Ezekiel 20:27</a> it is translated "blasphemeth." Perhaps "affronteth" would be better. He that deliberately broke the commandment of the Lord avowed him. self his open enemy, and, as it were, challenged him to single combat. <span class="cmt_word">Cut off.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:30-36 Those are to be reckoned presumptuous sinners, who sin designedly against God's will and glory. Sins thus committed are exceedingly sinful. He that thus breaks the commandment reproaches the Lord. He also despises the word of the Lord. Presumptuous sinners despise it, thinking themselves too great, too good, and too wise, to be ruled by it. A particular instance of presumption in the sin of sabbath-breaking is related. The offence was gathering sticks on the sabbath day, to make a fire, whereas the people were to bake and seethe what they had occasion for, the day before, Ex 16:23. This was done as an affront both to the law and to the Lawgiver. God is jealous for the honour of his sabbaths, and will not hold him guiltless who profanes them, whatever men may do. God intended this punishment for a warning to all, to make conscience of keeping holy the sabbath. And we may be assured that no command was ever given for the punishment of sin, which, at the judgment day, shall not prove to have come from perfect love and justice. The right of God to a day of devotion to himself, will be disputed and denied only by such as listen to the pride and unbelief of their hearts, rather than to the teaching of the Spirit of truth and life. Wherein consists the difference between him who was detected gathering sticks in the wilderness on the day of God, and the man who turns his back upon the blessings of sabbath appointments, and the promises of sabbath mercies, to use his time, his cares, and his soul, in heaping up riches; and waste his hours, his property, and his strength in sinful pleasure? Wealth may come by the unhallowed effort, but it will not come alone; it will have its awful reward. Sinful pursuits lead to ruin.</body></html>
