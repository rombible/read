Since all who were liable had paid that tax (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25, 26</a>), it would only have been requisite to make slight; corrections for death or coming of age during the interval.

No doubt the lists and pedigrees collected at this time laid the foundation of that exact and careful genealogical lore which played so important a part both in the religious and in the secular history of the Jews down to the final dispersion. Every Jew had not only his national, but also (and often even more) his tribal and family, associations, traditions, and sympathies. Unity, but <span class="accented">not</span> uniformity, - unity in all deepest interests and highest purposes, combined with great variety of character, of tradition, and even of tendency, - was the ideal of the life of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The number</span> <span class="cmt_word">of their names.</span> It is impossible to help thinking of the parallel expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>, of the similarity in position of the two peoples, of the contrast between their numbers and apparent chances of success, of the more striking contrast between their actual achievements. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-43 The people were numbered to show God's faithfulness in thus increasing the seed of Jacob, that they might be the better trained for the wars and conquest of Canaan, and to ascertain their families in order to the division of the land. It is said of each tribe, that those were numbered who were able to go forth to war; they had wars before them, though now they met with no opposition. Let the believer be prepared to withstand the enemies of his soul, though all may appear to be peace.</body></html>
