His father's name (<span class= "ital">Beor</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>from <span class= "ital">baar </span>(to consume), has been thought to denote that Balaam belonged to a family in which the magical art was hereditary. He is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-22.htm" title="Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.">Joshua 13:22</a> as "the soothsayer" (Hebrew, <span class= "ital">kosem</span>)--i.e., one of that class of persons who were not to be tolerated amongst the Israelites, and who are spoken of as "an abomination unto the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/18-10.htm" title="There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>).

The former derivation receives some support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14, 15</a>, where "Nicolaitans" are thought by many to be only a Greek form of" Balaamites" <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Beor (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>) has a similar signification, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, to burn, or consume. Both names have probable reference to the supposed effect of their maledictions, for successful cursing was an hereditary profession in many. lands, as it still is in some. Beer appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a> as Bosor, which is called a Chaldeeism, but the origin of the change is really unknown. A "Bela son of Beer" is named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-32.htm">Genesis 36:32</a> as reigning in Edom, but the coincidence is of no importance: kings and magicians have always loved to give themselves names of fear, and their vocabulary was not extensive. <span class="cmt_word">To Pother, which</span> is by <span class="cmt_word">the river of the land of the children of his people.</span> Rather, "which is on the river," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the great river Euphrates, "in the land of the children of his people," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in his native land. The situation of Pethor (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) is unknown. <span class="cmt_word">Here is a people come out of Egypt.</span> Forty years had passed since their fathers had left Egypt. Yet Balak's words expressed a great truth, for this people was no wandering desert tribe, but for all intents the same great organized nation which had spoiled Egypt, and left Pharaoh's host dead behind them. <span class="cmt_word">They abide over against me</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>.

This would hardly have been said when Israel was encamped thirty miles north of Arnon, opposite to Jericho. The two embassies to Balaam must have occupied some time, and in the mean while Israel would have gone further on his way. We may naturally conclude that the first message was sent immediately after the defeat of Sihon, at a time when Israel was encamped very near the border of Moab. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-14 The king of Moab formed a plan to get the people of Israel cursed; that is, to set God against them, who had hitherto fought for them. He had a false notion, that if he could get some prophet to pray for evil upon them, and to pronounce a blessing upon himself and his forces, that then he should be able to deal with them. None had so great a reputation as Balaam; and Balak will employ him, though he send a great way for him. It is not known whether the Lord had ever spoken to Balaam, or by him, before this; though it is probable he had, and it is certain he did afterwards. Yet we have abundant proof that he lived and died a wicked man, an enemy to God and his people. And the curse shall not come upon us if there is not a cause, even though men utter it. To prevail with Balaam, they took the wages of unrighteousness, but God laid restraint upon Balaam, forbidding him to curse Israel. Balaam was no stranger to Israel's cause; so that he ought to have answered the messengers at once, that he would never curse a people whom God had blessed; but he takes a night's time to consider what he should do. When we parley with temptations, we are in great danger of being overcome. Balaam was not faithful in returning God's answer to the messengers. Those are a fair mark for Satan's temptation, who lessen Divine restraints; as if to go against God's law were only to go without his leave. The messengers also are not faithful in returning Balaam's answer to Balak. Thus many are abused by the flatteries of those about them, and are prevented from seeing their own faults and follies.</body></html>
