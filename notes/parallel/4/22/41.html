Hengstenberg observes that "Balak started with the supposition that Balaam must necessarily have the Israelites in view if his curse was to take effect."<p><span class= "bld">That thence he might see the utmost part of the people.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And he saw from thence, &c. </span>If the Authorised Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-13.htm" title="And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.">Numbers 23:13</a> is correct, it seems necessary to understand these words as denoting that Balaam had a view from Bamoth-Baal of the whole army of Israel, even to the very extremity. or utmost part of the camp. This verse, however, is more commonly interpreted as denoting that Balaam saw only the extremity of the camp. So the Targum of Palestine: "He saw from thence the camp of Dan, which went at the rear of the people." (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-13.htm" title="And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.">Numbers 23:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Chapter 22:41.</span> - The high places of Baal, or "Bamoth-Baal." Perhaps the Bamoth mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-19.htm">Numbers 21:19, 20</a>. This is, however, by no means certain, because high places were no doubt numerous, and that Bamoth would seem to have been too far from the present camp of Israel. In any case they crossed the Arnon, and ran some risk by adventuring themselves on hostile territory. <span class="cmt_word">That thence he might see the utmost part of the people.</span> According to the quasi-sacramental character attributed to the cursing of a seer, it was held necessary that the subject of the curse should be in view. Balak desired to attain this object with as little risk as possible, and therefore he took Balaam first of all to these heights, whence a distant and partial view of Israel might be had. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:36-41 Balak has now nothing to complain of, but that Balaam did not come sooner. Balaam bids Balak not depend too much upon him. He seems to speak with vexation; but is really as desirous to please Balak, as ever he had pretended to be to please God. See what need we have to pray every day, Our Father which art in heaven, lead us not into temptation. Let us be jealous over our own hearts, seeing how far men may go in the knowledge of God, and yet come short of Divine grace.</body></html>
