The heathens united a firm belief in the powers of the seer with a very shrewd appreciation of the motives and character of the seer. Compare the saying of Sophocles ('Antig.,' 1055), <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:15-21 A second embassy was sent to Balaam. It were well for us, if we were as earnest and constant in prosecuting a good work, notwithstanding disappointments. Balak laid a bait, not only for Balaam's covetousness, but for his pride and ambition. How earnestly should we beg of God daily to mortify such desires in us! Thus sinners stick at no pains, spare no cost, and care not how low they stoop, to gratify their luxury, or their malice. Shall we then be unwilling to do what is right? God forbid! Balaam's convictions charged him to keep to the command of God; nor could any man have spoken better. But many call God theirs, who are not his, not truly because not only his. There is no judging men by their words; God knows the heart. Balaam's corruptions at the same time inclined him to go contrary to the command. He seemed to refuse the temptation; but he expressed no abhorrence of it. He had a strong desire to accept the offer, and hoped that God might give him leave to go. He had already been told what the will of God was. It is a certain evidence of the ruling of corruption in the heart, to beg leave to sin. God gave Balaam up to his own heart's lusts. As God sometimes denies the prayers of his people in love, so sometimes he grants the desires of the wicked in wrath.</body></html>
