In a vision. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. An internal vision, in which the eyes (even if open) saw nothing, but the effects of vision' were produced upon the sensorium by other and supernatural means (see, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>). Speak unto him in a dream. Rather, speak "in him" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>. The voice that spake to the prophet was an internal voice, causing no vibration of the outer air, but affecting only the inner and hidden seat of consciousness. It is not necessary to restrict the prophetic dream to the time of sleep; a waking state, resembling what we call day-dream, in which the external senses arc quiescent, and the imagination is freed from its usual restraints, was perhaps the more usual mental condition at the time. Indeed the Divine communications made to Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>) and to the Magi (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-12.htm">Numbers 2:12</a>) are almost the only ones we read of as made during actual sleep, unless we include the case of Pilate's wife (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-19.htm">Numbers 27:19</a>); and none of these were prophets in the ordinary sense. Compare, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> b. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-9 The patience of Moses was tried in his own family, as well as by the people. The pretence was, that he had married a foreign wife; but probably their pride was hurt, and their envy stirred up, by his superior authority. Opposition from our near relations, and from religious friends, is most painful. But this is to be looked for, and it will be well if in such circumstances we can preserve the gentleness and meekness of Moses. Moses was thus fitted to the work he was called to. God not only cleared Moses, but praised him. Moses had the spirit of prophecy in a way which set him far above all other prophets; yet he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he; and our Lord Jesus infinitely excels him, Heb 3:1. Let Miriam and Aaron consider whom it was they insulted. We have reason to be afraid of saying or doing any thing against the servants of God. And those are presumptuous indeed who are not afraid to speak evil of dignities, 2Pe 2:10. The removal of God's presence is the surest and saddest token of God's displeasure. Woe to us, if he depart! he never departs, till by sin and folly we drive him from us.</body></html>
