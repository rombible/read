It is strange that, in the face of a statement so general and so emphatic, it should have been doubted whether it applied to such prophets as Isaiah or Daniel. It was exactly in "visions" and in "dreams," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, under the peculiar psychological conditions so-called, that these greatest of prophets received their revelations from heaven. The exceeding richness and wonder of some of these revelations did not alter the mode in which they were received, nor raise them out of the ordinary conditions of the <span class="accented">gradus propheticus.</span> As prophets of future things they were much greater than Moses, and their writings may be to us far more precious; but that does not concern the present question, which turns exclusively upon the relation between the Divine Giver and the human receiver of the revelation. If words mean anything, the assertion here is that Moses stood on an altogether different footing from the "prophet of the Lord" in respect of the communications which he received from the Lord. It is this essential superiority of position on the part of Moses which alone gives force and meaning to the important declarations of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a> b.; John 6:14; 7:40, etc. Moses had <span class="accented">no</span> successor in his relations with God until that Son of man came, who was "in heaven" all the time he walked and spake on earth. <span class="cmt_word">Who is</span> <span class="cmt_word">faithful in all mine house,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;</span> means to be proved, or attested, and so established (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-14.htm">1 Samuel 22:14</a>). The Septuagint gives the true sense, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and so it is quoted in the Epistle to the Hebrews (chapter 3:2). The "house" of God, as the adjective "whole" shows, is not the tabernacle, but the house of Israel; the' word "house" standing for household, family, nation, as so often in the sacred writings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-9 The patience of Moses was tried in his own family, as well as by the people. The pretence was, that he had married a foreign wife; but probably their pride was hurt, and their envy stirred up, by his superior authority. Opposition from our near relations, and from religious friends, is most painful. But this is to be looked for, and it will be well if in such circumstances we can preserve the gentleness and meekness of Moses. Moses was thus fitted to the work he was called to. God not only cleared Moses, but praised him. Moses had the spirit of prophecy in a way which set him far above all other prophets; yet he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he; and our Lord Jesus infinitely excels him, Heb 3:1. Let Miriam and Aaron consider whom it was they insulted. We have reason to be afraid of saying or doing any thing against the servants of God. And those are presumptuous indeed who are not afraid to speak evil of dignities, 2Pe 2:10. The removal of God's presence is the surest and saddest token of God's displeasure. Woe to us, if he depart! he never departs, till by sin and folly we drive him from us.</body></html>
