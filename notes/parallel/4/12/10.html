In an ordinary case of leprosy, when the disease covered the whole body, and the whole of the flesh had turned white, the man was to be pronounced clean. It was otherwise in cases in which persons were smitten with leprosy by the immediate hand of God, as in the case of Moses and in that of Gehazi.<p><span class= "bld">And Aaron looked upon Miriam . . . --</span>Or, <span class= "ital">and Aaron turned towards Miriam</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>directed his attention to her, &c. This may have been the first case in which Aaron was required to carry into execution the laws laid down in Leviticus 13, 14, respecting the inspection of the leper; and the duties which devolved upon him must have been doubly painful from the fact that the leper stood in a near relationship to himself, and that he had been a participator in the sin which had called for so severe a punishment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The cloud departed from off the tabernacle.</span> During this awful interview the cloud of the Presence had rested on the tabernacle, as if it were the Divine chariot waiting for the King of Israel while he tarried within (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-12.htm">Revelation 11:12</a>). Now that his work is done he ascends his chariot again, and soars aloft above the host. <span class="cmt_word">Miriam became leprous.</span> The Hebrews had become familiar with this terrible disease in Egypt. The Levitical legislation had made it more terrible by affixing to it the penalty of religious and social excommunication, and the stigma, as it were, of the Divine displeasure. Before this legislation Moses himself had been made partially and temporarily leprous, and that solely for a sign, and without any sense of punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-6.htm">Exodus 4:6</a>). In Miriam's ease, however, as in all subsequent cases, the plague of leprosy was endued with moral as well as physical horror (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-27.htm">2 Kings 5:27</a>). As snow. This expression points to the perfect development of the disease, as contrasted with its earlier and less conspicuous stages. <span class="cmt_word">Aaron looked upon Miriam.</span> If we ask why Aaron himself was not punished, the answer appears to be the same here as in the case of the golden calf. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He was not the leader in mischief, but only led into it through weakness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He was, like many weak men, of an affectionate disposition (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-19.htm">Leviticus 10:19</a>), and suffered his own punishment in witnessing that of others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> He was God's high priest, and the office would have shared in the disgrace of the man. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:10-16 The cloud departed, and Miriam became leprous. When God goes, evil comes: expect no good when God departs. Her foul tongue, as Bishop Hall says, was justly punished with a foul face. Aaron, as priest, was judge of the leprosy. He could not pronounce her leprous without trembling, knowing himself to be equally guilty. But if she was thus punished for speaking against Moses, what will become of those who sin against Christ? Aaron, who joined his sister in speaking against Moses, is forced for himself and his sister, to beseech him, and to speak highly of him whom he had so lately blamed. Those who trample upon the saints and servants of God, will one day be glad to make court to them. It is well when rebukes produce confession of sin and repentance. Such offenders, though corrected and disgraced, shall be pardoned. Moses made it appear, that he forgave the injury done him. To this pattern of Moses, and that of our Saviour, who said, Father, forgive them, we must conform. A reason is given for Miriam's being put out of the camp for seven days; because thus she ought to accept the punishment of her sin. When under the tokens of God's displeasure for sin, it becomes us to take shame to ourselves. This hindered the people's progress in their march forward towards Canaan. Many things oppose us, but nothing so hinders us in the way to heaven, as sin.</body></html>
