Some writers have supposed that Jochebed was the granddaughter, or possibly even some more remote descendant of Levi, and that Amram, the father of Moses, was not the same as Amram, the son of Kohath. (See Keil, "On the Pentateuch," i. 469-471; but for a defence of the view which has been more commonly adopted, see Birks' "Exodus of Israel," pp. 153-199.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 59.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt.</span> Rather, "whom she (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span>) bare." The missing subject is usually supplied, as in the A.V., and there certainly seems no more difficulty in doing so here than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-6.htm">1 Kings 1:6</a>. Some critics take "Atha" as a proper name - "whom Atha bare;" others render "who was born;" this, however, like the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f76;</span>, requires a change of reading.
