On this decrease Bishop Wordsworth observes as follows:--"When the Israelites were suffering persecution in Egypt they 'multiplied exceedingly' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.">Exodus 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-20.htm" title="Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.">Exodus 1:20</a>); but after their deliverance from Egypt they rebelled against God, and 'He consumed their days in vanity, and their years in trouble' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-33.htm" title="Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.">Psalm 78:33</a>). . . . Here there is comfort and warning to the Church and every soul in it--comfort in time of affliction, and warning in days of prosperity."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These were the numbered of the children of Israel.</span> The results of this census as compared with the former may be tabulated thus: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Tribe. ?

It has been proposed to explain this on the ground of their both being pastoral tribes; but if the members of these tribes were more scattered than the rest, it would be just in their case that we should expect to find round numbers. The one fact which these figures establish in a startling way is, that while the nation as a whole remained heady stationary in point of numbers, the various tribes show a most unexpected variation. Manasseh, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, has increased his population 63 per cent. in spite of the fact that there is not one man left of sixty years of age, while Simeon has decreased in the same proportion. There is indeed little difficulty in accounting for diminishing numbers amidst so many hardships, and after so many plagues. The fact that Zimri belonged to the tribe of Simeon, and that this tribe was omitted soon after from the blessing of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>), may easily lead to the conclusion that Simeon was more than any other tribe involved in the sin of Baal-Peor and the punishment which followed. But when we compare, e. <span class="accented">g.</span>, the twin tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, concerning whom nothing distinctive is either stated or hinted, whether bad or good; and when we find that the one has decreased 20 percent and the other increased 63 percent during the same interval, and under the same general circumstances, we cannot even guess at the causes which must have been at work to produce so striking a difference. It is evident that each tribe had its own history apart from the general history of the nation - a history which had the most important results for its own members, but of which we know almost nothing. It is observable, however, that all the tribes under the leadership of Judah increased, whilst all those in the camp of Reuben decreased. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-51 Moses did not number the people but when God commanded him. We have here the families registered, as well as the tribes. The total was nearly the same as when numbered at mount Sinai. Notice is here taken of the children of Korah; they died not, as the children of Dathan and Abiram; they seem not to have joined even their own father in rebellion. If we partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall not partake of their plagues.</body></html>
