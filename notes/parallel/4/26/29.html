According to the present enumeration there were eight families in Manasseh, one named after his son Machir, one after his grandson Gilead, and the rest after his great-grandsons. The list given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1, 2</a> agrees with this, except that the Machirites and the Gileadites are apparently identified. It appears from the genealogy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7.htm">1 Chronicles 7</a> that the mother of Machir was a stranger from Aram, the country of Laban. This may perhaps account for the fact that Machir's son received the name of Gilead, for Gilead was the border land between Aram and Canaan; it more probably explains the subsequent allotment of territory in that direction to the Machirites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40</a>). Gilead appears again as a proper name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-2.htm">Judges 11:2</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-51 Moses did not number the people but when God commanded him. We have here the families registered, as well as the tribes. The total was nearly the same as when numbered at mount Sinai. Notice is here taken of the children of Korah; they died not, as the children of Dathan and Abiram; they seem not to have joined even their own father in rebellion. If we partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall not partake of their plagues.</body></html>
