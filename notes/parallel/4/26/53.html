The extent of territory was to be determined by the number of names--i.e., of persons--in each tribe, and each inheritance was to bear the name of the ancestor of the tribe. Rashi says that the names of the twelve tribes were written on twelve scrolls of parchment, and twelve borders, or limits of land, on twelve others, and that they were mixed together in an urn.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to the number of the names.</span> The intention clearly was that the extent of the territory assigned to each tribe, and called by its name (verse 55, b), should be regulated according to its numbers at the discretion of the rulers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:52-56 In distributing these tribes, the general rule of equity is prescribed; that to many should be given more, and to fewer less.
