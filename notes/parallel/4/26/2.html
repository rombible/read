A general command to "vex the Midianites" had indeed been given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-17.htm">Numbers 25:17</a>) on the principle of just retribution (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6</a>), but no attempt seems to have been made to act upon it until a more specific order was issued (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-2.htm">Numbers 31:2</a>). In any case the present mustering has to do with something far more important, viz., with the approaching settlement of the people in its own territory. This is clear from the instructions given in verses 52-56, and from the distribution of the tribes into families. <span class="cmt_word">From twenty years.</span> See on chapter Numbers 1:3. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-51 Moses did not number the people but when God commanded him. We have here the families registered, as well as the tribes. The total was nearly the same as when numbered at mount Sinai. Notice is here taken of the children of Korah; they died not, as the children of Dathan and Abiram; they seem not to have joined even their own father in rebellion. If we partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall not partake of their plagues.</body></html>
