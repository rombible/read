The Samaritan Pentateuch, however, has a different reading here. It transposes the words "and Korah," and combines them with the words"and the two hundred and fifty men": thus--"when the fire devoured Korah and the two hundred and fifty men." (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.">Numbers 16:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-35.htm" title="And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.">Numbers 16:35</a>.) It is possible that there may have been an omission here of the words which are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.">Numbers 16:32</a>, "all the men that appertained unto," or of words denoting "all the goods belonging to."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Swallowed them up together with Korah.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>.

This distinct statement, which is not modified in the Targums, seems decisive as to the fate of Korah. If indeed it were quite certain from the detailed narrative in chapter 16 that Korah perished with his own company, and not with the Reubenites, then it might be deemed necessary to force this statement into accordance with that certainty; but it is nowhere stated, or even clearly implied, that he perished by fire, and therefore there is no excuse for doing violence to the obvious meaning of this verse. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were swallowed up, we are told, at the same time that Korah's company were consumed by fire; that is a clear statement, and cannot be set aside by any supposed necessity for avenging the sacri1egious ambition of Korah by the element of fire. <span class="cmt_word">And they became a sign.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>properly means a banner or ensign, and is unusual in this sense. It exactly corresponds, however, to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and has no doubt the same secondary signification - a something made conspicuous in order to attract attention and enforce a warning (cf. chapter Numbers 16:30, 38). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-51 Moses did not number the people but when God commanded him. We have here the families registered, as well as the tribes. The total was nearly the same as when numbered at mount Sinai. Notice is here taken of the children of Korah; they died not, as the children of Dathan and Abiram; they seem not to have joined even their own father in rebellion. If we partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall not partake of their plagues.</body></html>
