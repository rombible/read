The wilderness of gin can scarcely be anything else than the Wady Murreh, with more or less of the barren hills which rise to the south of it, for this wady undoubtedly forms the natural southern boundary of Canaan. All travelers agree both as to the remarkable character of the depression itself and as to the contrast between its northern and southern mountain walls. To the south lies the inhospitable and un-cultivatable desert; to the north the often arid and treeless, but still partially green and habitable, plateau of Southern Palestine. The expression, "on the sides of Edom," can only mean that beyond the Wady Murreh lay territory belonging to Edom, the Mount Seir of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>, the Seir of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>; it does not seem possible that Edom proper, which lay to the east of the Arabah, and which barely marched at all with the land of Canaan, should be intended here (see on Joshua 15:1, and the note on the site of Kadesh). <span class="cmt_word">And your south border.</span> This begins a fresh paragraph, in which the southern boundary, already roughly fixed, is described in greater detail. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be</span> <span class="cmt_word">the utmost coast of the salt sea eastward.</span> Rather, "shall be from the extremity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>) of the salt sea eastward" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-2.htm">Joshua 15:2</a>). The easternmost point in this boundary was to be fixed at the southernmost extremity of the Salt Sea. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-15 Canaan was of small extent; as it is here bounded, it is but about 160 miles in length, and about 50 in breadth; yet this was the country promised to the father of the faithful, and the possession of the seed of Israel. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the garden enclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness of the space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and serve him; but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see how little a share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who have their portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a small pittance of this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, having it from the love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable than the riches of many wicked.</body></html>
