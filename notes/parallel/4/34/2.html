Nor is there any clear instance of its including the trans-Jordanic territories. In the prophets the word reverts to its proper (etymological) meaning, as the "flat country" along the Mediterranean coast (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This is the land that shall fall unto you.</span> These words should not be placed in a parenthesis; it is a simple statement in the tautological style so common in these books. <span class="cmt_word">With</span> <span class="cmt_word">the coasts thereof,</span> or, "according to its boundaries," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, within the limits which nature and the Divine decree had set to the land of Canaan. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-15 Canaan was of small extent; as it is here bounded, it is but about 160 miles in length, and about 50 in breadth; yet this was the country promised to the father of the faithful, and the possession of the seed of Israel. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the garden enclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness of the space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and serve him; but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see how little a share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who have their portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a small pittance of this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, having it from the love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable than the riches of many wicked.</body></html>
