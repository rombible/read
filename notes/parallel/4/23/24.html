Balaam transfers to the whole nation that which Jacob had prophesied of Judah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a great lion.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, generally translated "old lion," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>. By some it is rendered lioness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a young lion.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, the ordinary term for a lion without further distinction. It is altogether fantastic to suppose that Balaam had just seen a lieu coming up from the ghor of Jordan, and that this "omen" inspired his "<span class="accented">mashal</span>." The rising of a lion from its covert was one of the most common of the more striking phenomena of nature in those regions, and the imagery it afforded was in constant use; but in truth it is evident that these similes are borrowed from Jacob's dying prophecy concerning Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>), in which the word "prey" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>, a torn thing) is also found. Balaam was acquainted with that prophecy, as he was with the promises made to Abraham (cf. verse 10 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:11-30 Balak was angry with Balaam. Thus a confession of God's overruling power is extorted from a wicked prophet, to the confusion of a wicked prince. A second time the curse is turned into a blessing; and this blessing is both larger and stronger than the former. Men change their minds, and break their words; but God never changes his mind, and therefore never recalls his promise. And when in Scripture he is said to repent, it does not mean any change of his mind; but only a change of his way. There was sin in Jacob, and God saw it; but there was not such as might provoke him to give them up to ruin. If the Lord sees that we trust in his mercy, and accept of his salvation; that we indulge no secret lust, and continue not in rebellion, but endeavour to serve and glorify him; we may be sure that he looks upon us as accepted in Christ, that our sins are all pardoned. Oh the wonders of providence and grace, the wonders of redeeming love, of pardoning mercy, of the new-creating Spirit! Balak had no hope of ruining Israel, and Balaam showed that he had more reason to fear being ruined by them. Since Balaam cannot say what he would have him, Balak wished him to say nothing. But though there are many devices in man's heart, God's counsels shall stand. Yet they resolve to make another attempt, though they had no promise on which to build their hopes. Let us, who have a promise that the vision at the end shall speak and not lie, continue earnest in prayer, Lu 18:1.</body></html>
