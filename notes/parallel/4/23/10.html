The end of Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm" title="And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.">Numbers 31:8</a>) presented a strange contrast to his prayer, and showed that even the prayer of the wicked is abomination in the sight of the Lord. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-9.htm" title="He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.">Proverbs 28:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">fourth part of Israel.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is so rendered by the Targums, as alluding to the four great camps into which the host was divided. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, apparently from an incorrect reading. The Samaritan and the older versions, followed by the Vulgate, render it "progeny,'" but this meaning is conjectural, and there seems no sufficient reason to depart from the common translation. <span class="cmt_word">Let me die the death</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the righteous.</span> The word "righteous" is in the plural (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>): it may refer either to the Israelites as a holy nation, living and dying in the favour of God; or to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, the promises made to whom, in faith of which they died, were already so gloriously fulfilled. If the former reference was intended, Balaam must have had a much fuller and happier knowledge of "life and immortality" than the Israelites themselves, to whom death was dreadful, all the more that it ended a life protected and blessed by God (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>). It is hardly credible that so singular an anticipation of purely Christian feeling should really be found in the mouth of a prophet of that day, for it is clear that the words, however much inspired, did express the actual emotion of Balaam at the moment. It is therefore more consistent with the facts and probabilities of the case to suppose that Balaam referred to righteous Abraham (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) and his immediate descendants, and wished that when he came to die he might have as sure a hope as they had enjoyed that God would bless and multiply their seed, and make their name to be glorious in the earth. <span class="cmt_word">Let my last end be like his.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (last end) is the same word translated "latter days" and "latter end" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14, 20</a>. It means the last state of a people or of a man as represented in his offspring; the sense is not incorrectly expressed by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-10 With the camps of Israel full in view, Balaam ordered seven altars to be built, and a bullock and a ram to be offered on each. Oh the sottishness of superstition, to imagine that God will be at man's beck! The curse is turned into a blessing, by the overruling power of God, in love to Israel. God designed to serve his own glory by Balaam, and therefore met him. If God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, who would have defied God and Israel, surely he will not be wanting to those who desire to glorify God, and to edify his people; it shall be given what they should speak. He who opened the mouth of the ass, caused the mouth of this wicked man to speak words as contrary to the desire of his heart, as those of the ass were to the powers of the brute. The miracle was as great in the one case as in the other. Balaam pronounces Israel safe. He owns he could do no more than God suffered him to do. He pronounces them happy in their distinction from the rest of the nations. Happy in their numbers, which made them both honourable and formidable. Happy in their last end. Death is the end of all men; even the righteous must die, and it is good for us to think of this with regard to ourselves, as Balaam does here, speaking of his own death. He pronounces the righteous truly blessed, not only while they live, but when they die; which makes their death even more desirable than life itself. But there are many who desire to die the death of the righteous, but do not endeavour to live the life of the righteous; gladly would they have an end like theirs, but not a way like theirs. They would be saints in heaven, but not saints on earth. This saying of Balaam's is only a wish, not a prayer; it is a vain wish, being only a wish for the end, without any care for the means. Many seek to quiet their consciences with the promise of future amendment, or take up with some false hope, while they neglect the only way of salvation, by which a sinner can be righteous before God.</body></html>
