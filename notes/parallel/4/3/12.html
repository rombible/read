It is almost always assumed that their zeal in the matter of the golden calf was the ground of the preference shown to them now. But it may be doubted whether there was any "preference" in the matter at all. To Aaron and his seed on undoubted and important preference was shown, but the functions and position of the Levites were not such as to give them any preeminence, or to secure them any substantial advantage. They were tied down to the performance of routine duties, which demanded no intelligence, and gave scope for no ambitions. The one obvious reason why Levi was selected is to be found in the fact that he was by far the smallest in numbers among the tribes, being less than half the next smallest, Manasseh, and almost exactly balancing the first-born. A larger tribe could not have been spared, and would not have been needed, for the purpose in question. If any more recondite motive must be sought for the Divine selection, it must be found in the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>. Levi as well as Simeon, though in a different way, was doomed never to raise his head as a united and powerful tribe among his brethren. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Numbers 3:13 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because all the first-born are</span> mine (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>, and below on verse 43). That the powers of heaven had a special claim upon the firstling of man or beast was probably one of the oldest religious ideas in the world, which it would be difficult to trace to any origin but in some primeval revelation. It branched out into many superstitions, of which the cruel cultus of Moloch was the worst. Among the tribes which preserved the patriarchal faith, it retained more or less of its primitive meaning in the assignment of sacrificial duties to the eldest son. According to the Targums, the "young men of the children of Israel" sent by Moses to offer sacrifices before the consecration of Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>) were first-born. Whatever ancient and latent claims, however, God may have had upon the firstborn of Israel, they are here superseded by a special and recent claim founded upon their miraculous preservation when the first-born of the Egyptians were slain. All the firstborn in that day became "anathema," devoted to God, for evil or for good, for death or for life. He, to whom belongs the whole harvest of human souls, came and claimed his first-fruits from the fields of Egypt. He took unto himself by death the first-born of the Egyptians; he left for himself in life the first-born of the Israelites. For the convenience, however, of the people, and for the better and more regular discharge of the ministry, he was content to take the single small tribe of Levi in lieu of the first-born of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Numbers 3:12 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Instead of all the first-born.</span> The Septuagint inserts here, "they shall be their ransom." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Numbers 3:13 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine shall they be: I am the Lord.</span> Rather, "mine shall they be, mine, the Lord's." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Numbers 3:15 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From a month old.</span> The first-born were to be redeemed "from a month old" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-13 There was much work belonging to the priests' office, and there were now only Aaron and his two sons to do it; God appoints the Levites to attend them. Those whom God finds work for, he will find help for. The Levites were taken instead of the first-born. When He that made us, saves us, as the first-born of Israel were saved, we are laid under further obligations to serve him faithfully. God's right to us by redemption, confirms the right he has to us by creation.</body></html>
