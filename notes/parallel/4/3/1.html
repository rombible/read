whereas the office of Aaron was perpetuated in the persons of his descendants. Hence we find no mention made in this place of the sons of Moses, but only of those of Aaron. The word <span class= "ital">generations </span>here, as in the book of Genesis (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-19.htm" title="And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:">Genesis 25:19</a>) and elsewhere, is used to denote the <span class= "ital">history; </span>and in this sense the present and the following chapters pertain as much to Moses as to Aaron. Or the reference may be to the fact that Moses and Aaron were made the heads of the whole tribe of Levi, and therefore that the Levitical families generally are traced up equally to both.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These... are the generations of Aaron and Moses.</span> The word "generations" (<span class="accented">toledoth</span>) is used here in a peculiar and, so to speak, technical sense, with reference to what follows, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>. It marks a new departure, looking <span class="accented">down</span>, not <span class="accented">up</span>, the course of history. Moses and Aaron were a beginning in themselves as the chosen heads of the chosen tribe: Moses having the higher office, but one entirely personal to himself; Aaron being the first of a long and eminent line of priests. The actual genealogy, therefore, is that of Aaron, and he is placed first. In <span class="cmt_word">the day.</span> Apparently the day mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1</a>; or it may be more general, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-13 There was much work belonging to the priests' office, and there were now only Aaron and his two sons to do it; God appoints the Levites to attend them. Those whom God finds work for, he will find help for. The Levites were taken instead of the first-born. When He that made us, saves us, as the first-born of Israel were saved, we are laid under further obligations to serve him faithfully. God's right to us by redemption, confirms the right he has to us by creation.</body></html>
