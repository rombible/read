Hamath, now Hamah, was in Greek times Epiphaneia, on the Orontes, outside the limits of Jewish rule. The southern entrance to it lay between the ranges of Libanus and Anti-libanus (see note on Numbers 34:8). The Rehob here mentioned is not likely to have been either of the Rehobs in the territory of Asher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28-30</a>), but the Beth-rehob further to the east, and near to where Dan-Laish was afterwards built (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>). It lies on the route to Hamath, and was at one time a place of some importance in the possession of the Syrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:21-25 The searchers of the land brought a bunch of grapes with them, and other fruits, as proofs of the goodness of the country; which was to Israel both the earnest and the specimen of all the fruits of Canaan.
