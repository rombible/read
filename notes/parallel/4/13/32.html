(See Roberts' <span class= "ital">Oriental Illustrations, </span>p. 101, 8vo, 1844.) It seems more probable, however, that the allusion is to the strife and discord which prevailed amongst the various tribes who contended for its possession. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-38.htm" title="And you shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.">Leviticus 26:38</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Men of great stature.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">men of measures </span>(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you, and they shall be yours: they shall come after you; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to you, they shall make supplication to you, saying, Surely God is in you; and there is none else, there is no God.">Isaiah 45:14</a>), where the word <span class= "ital">middah, measure, </span>occurs in the singular number, "men of stature." Such persons did undoubtedly exist in the land of Canaan, but there is no evidence that the inhabitants generally were of extraordinary size.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof.</span> This cannot mean that the people died of starvation, pestilence, or other natural causes, which would have been contrary to facts and to their own report. It must mean that the population was continually changing through internecine wars, and the incursions of fresh tribes from the surrounding wastes. The history of Palestine from first to last testifies to the constant presence of this d anger. The remarkable variation in the lists of tribes inhabiting Canaan may be thus accounted for. <span class="cmt_word">All the</span> <span class="cmt_word">people... are men of great stature,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> "men of measures.

The "all" is an exaggeration very natural to men who had to justify the counsels of cowardice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:26-33 We may wonder that the people of Israel staid forty days for the return of their spies, when they were ready to enter Canaan, under all the assurances of success they could have from the Divine power, and the miracles that had hitherto attended them. But they distrusted God's power and promise. How much we stand in our own light by our unbelief! At length the messengers returned; but the greater part discouraged the people from going forward to Canaan. Justly are the Israelites left to this temptation, for putting confidence in the judgment of men, when they had the word of God to trust in. Though they had found the land as good as God had said, yet they would not believe it to be as sure as he had said, but despaired of having it, though Eternal Truth had engaged it to them. This was the representation of the evil spies. Caleb, however, encouraged them to go forward, though seconded by Joshua only. He does not say, Let us go up and conquer it; but, Let us go and possess it. Difficulties that are in the way of salvation, dwindle and vanish before a lively, active faith in the power and promise of God. All things are possible, if they are promised, to him that believes; but carnal sense and carnal professors are not to be trusted. Unbelief overlooks the promises and power of God, magnifies every danger and difficulty, and fills the heart with discouragement. May the Lord help us to believe! we shall then find all things possible.</body></html>
