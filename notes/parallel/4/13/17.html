where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)">Numbers 13:22</a>). The southern part of Palestine was known by the name of <span class= "ital">the Negeb. </span>It formed the transition from the desert to the more highly cultivated land, and was more fitted for grazing than for agricultural purposes. (See Wilton's <span class= "ital">The Negeb</span>.)<p><span class= "bld">Into the mountain.--</span>The word which is here used commonly denotes the hill country, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the mountainous part of Palestine, which was inhabited by the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites.

The same word is rendered "the mountains" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-29.htm" title="The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.">Numbers 13:29</a>. The reference here, however, may be to the particular mountain which was nearest to the encampment of the Israelites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-40.htm" title="And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying, See, we be here, and will go up to the place which the LORD has promised: for we have sinned.">Numbers 14:40</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Get</span> <span class="cmt_word">you up this way</span> <span class="cmt_word">southward.</span> Rather, "get you up there (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) in the Negeb." The Negeb, meaning literally "the dryness," was the south-western district of Canaan, which bordered upon the desert, and partook more or less of its character. Except where springs existed, and irrigation could be carried out, it was unfit for settled habitation. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>, where the same word is used. Go up into the mountain. From the Negeb they were to make their way into the mountain or hill country which formed the back-bone of Southern Palestine, from the Wady Murreh on the south to the plain of Esdraelon on the north. In after ages it formed the permanent center of the Jewish race and Jewish power. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-9.htm">Judges 1:9</a> where the three natural divisions of Southern Palestine are mentioned together: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>), the mountain; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39d;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), the steppe; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>), the maritime plain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-20 A memorable and melancholy history is related in this and the following chapter, of the turning back of Israel from the borders of Canaan, and the sentencing them to wander and perish in the wilderness, for their unbelief and murmuring. It appears, De 1:22, that the motion to search out the land came from the people. They had a better opinion of their own policy than of God's wisdom. Thus we ruin ourselves by believing the reports and representations of sense rather than Divine revelation. We walk by sight not by faith. Moses gave the spies this charge, Be of good courage. It was not only a great undertaking they were put upon, which required good management and resolution; but a great trust was reposed in them, which required that they should be faithful. Courage in such circumstances can only spring from strong faith, which Caleb and Joshua alone possessed.</body></html>
