Ritter says that the reputation of the grapes of Hebron is so great throughout all Palestine that there is no difficulty in believing that the valley of Eshcol was that which is directly north of the city of Hebron. The valley may have derived its name originally from Eshcol, the brother of Mamre the Amorite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm" title="And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelled in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.">Genesis 14:13</a>). In like manner the name of Mamre appears to have been transferred to the tree, or grove, of Mamre, which was opposite to the cave of Machpelah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-17.htm" title="And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure">Genesis 23:17</a>); and in this manner Eshcol is closely connected with Hebron in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-19.htm" title="And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.">Genesis 23:19</a> as it is in the present chapter.<p><span class= "bld">Upon a staff.--</span>The majority of travellers concur in estimating the weight of the largest clusters commonly produced in Palestine at about ten or twelve pounds. Kitto, however, mentions an instance of a bunch of Syrian grapes produced in our own country weighing nineteen pounds, which was sent by the Duke of Portland to the Marquis of Rockingham, and which was carried more than twenty miles by four labourers, two of whom bore it by rotation upon a staff. The greatest diameter of this cluster was nineteen inches and a half (<span class= "ital">Pictorial Bible, </span>in loc., 1855). The arrangement referred to in the text was probably made, not because the weight was too great for one person to carry, but in order to prevent the grapes from being crushed. The pomegranates and figs, which are still some of the most important fruits of Hebron (see <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book, </span>p. 583), were probably carried on the same pole. The words may be rendered thus: <span class= "ital">"And they bare it between two upon a staff; also some of the pomegranates and of the figs." </span>This incident has obvious reference to the homeward journey of the spies. As the grapes of Eshcol were to the Israelites both a pledge and a specimen of the fruits of Canaan, so the communion which believers have with God on earth is a pledge as well as a foretaste of the blessedness of heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">brook of Eshcol.</span> Rather, "the valley of Eshcol," for it is not a land of brooks. Probably between Hebron and Jerusalem, where the grapes are still exceptionally fine, and the dusters of great size. <span class="cmt_word">They bare it between two on a staff,</span> not on account of its weight, but simply in order not to spoil it. Common sense dictates the like precaution still in like cases. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:21-25 The searchers of the land brought a bunch of grapes with them, and other fruits, as proofs of the goodness of the country; which was to Israel both the earnest and the specimen of all the fruits of Canaan. Such are the present comforts we have in communion with God, foretastes of the fulness of joy we expect in the heavenly Canaan. We may see by them what heaven is.</body></html>
