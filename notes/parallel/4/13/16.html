On the other hand, it is quite possible that the name may have been proleptically adopted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm" title="And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.">Exodus 17:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-13.htm" title="And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.">Exodus 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm" title="And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.">Exodus 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-17.htm" title="And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.">Exodus 32:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.

It was afterwards contracted into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span> (Jeshua; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>), and has come to us in its current form through the Vulgate. The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, and so the name appears in the New Testament. It is an obvious difficulty that Joshua has already been called by his new name at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a>, and in every other place where he has been mentioned. In fact he is only once elsewhere called Hoshea, and that in a place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-44.htm">Deuteronomy 32:44</a>) where we should certainly not have expected it. There are two ways of explaining the difficulty, such as it is. We may suppose that the change of name was really made at this time, as the narrative seems (on the face of it) to assert; and then the previous mentions of Joshua by his subsequent and more familiar name will be cases of that anticipation which is so common in Scripture (cf., <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-14.htm">Mark 2:14</a>). Or we may suppose, what is perhaps more in harmony with the course of Joshua's life, that the change bad been already made at the time of the victory over Amalek. In that case the Vav consec. in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (and... called) must be referred to the order of thought, not of time, and a sufficient reason must be shown for the interpolation of the statement in this particular place. Such a reason may fairly be found in the probable fact that the names of the spies were copied out of the tribal registers, and that Joshua still appeared under his original name in those registers. As to the significance of the change, it is not easy to estimate it aright. On the one hand, the sacred syllable entered into so many of the Jewish names that it could not have seemed a very marked change; on the other hand, the fact that our Saviour received the same name because he was our Saviour throws a halo of glory about it which we cannot ignore. In the Divine providence Hoshea became Joshua because he was destined to be the temporal saviour of his people, and to lead them into their promised rest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-20 A memorable and melancholy history is related in this and the following chapter, of the turning back of Israel from the borders of Canaan, and the sentencing them to wander and perish in the wilderness, for their unbelief and murmuring. It appears, De 1:22, that the motion to search out the land came from the people. They had a better opinion of their own policy than of God's wisdom. Thus we ruin ourselves by believing the reports and representations of sense rather than Divine revelation. We walk by sight not by faith. Moses gave the spies this charge, Be of good courage. It was not only a great undertaking they were put upon, which required good management and resolution; but a great trust was reposed in them, which required that they should be faithful. Courage in such circumstances can only spring from strong faith, which Caleb and Joshua alone possessed.</body></html>
