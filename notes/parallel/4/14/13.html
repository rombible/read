They may be rendered in accordance with the Authorised Version, or they may be rendered as follows:--<span class= "ital">And Moses said unto the </span>LORD, <span class= "ital">The Egyptians have </span>both<span class= "ital"> heard that thou hast brought up this people from among them by thy might, and they have also told </span>(<span class= "ital">it</span>)<span class= "ital"> to the inhabitants of this land </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the land of Canaan, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-3.htm" title="And why has the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?">Numbers 14:3</a>); <span class= "ital">they </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Egyptians and the Canaanites) <span class= "ital">have heard that thou </span>LORD <span class= "ital">art in the midst of this people, for thou </span>LORD <span class= "ital">art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, &c. </span>&c. Reference may be made to the following passages in illustration of the argument by which Moses enforced his intercessory prayer on behalf of Israel:--<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/32-26.htm" title="I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:">Deuteronomy 32:26-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-9.htm" title="For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do to your great name?">Joshua 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-9.htm" title="For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I cut you not off.">Isaiah 48:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-11.htm" title="For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory to another.">Isaiah 48:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/36-22.htm" title="Therefore say to the house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the heathen, where you went.">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses said unto the Lord.</span> The words which follow are so confused, and the construction so dislocated, that they afford the strongest evidence that we have here the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the mediator, disordered as they were in the moment of utterance by passionate earnestness and an agonizing fear. Had Moses been ever so eloquent, a facility of speech at such a moment would have been alike unnatural and unlovely. What we can see in the words is this: that Moses had no thought for himself, and that it never occurred to him to entertain the tempting offer made to him by God; that he knew God too well, and (if we may say so) cared for God too much, to let him so compromise his honour among the nations, and so thwart his own purposes, without making one effort (however audacious) to turn his wrath aside. We can see that it is (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11, 12</a>, only much more boldly and abruptly) the thought of what the heathen would say which he wishes to thrust upon the Almighty; but we cannot be sure of the right translation of the words. The most literal rendering would seem to be, "Both the Egyptians have heard (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) that thou broughtest out this people from among them with thy might, and they have told it (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) to the inhabitants of this land; they have heard (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, repeated) that thou, Lord, art amongst this people," etc. The Septuagint, however, translates the first verb by a future (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), and, as this gives a much clearer sense, it is followed by the Targum Palestine and most of the versions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:11-19 Moses made humble intercession for Israel. Herein he was a type of Christ, who prayed for those that despitefully used him. The pardon of a nation's sin, is the turning away the nation's punishment; and for that Moses is here so earnest. Moses argued that, consistently with God's character, in his abundant mercies, he could forgive them.</body></html>
