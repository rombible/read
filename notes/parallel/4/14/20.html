Nevertheless the prayer of Moses was heard and answered, and the people were not wholly exterminated.<p>(21, 22, 23) <span class= "bld">But as truly as I live . . . --</span>The three verses may be rendered as follows:--<span class= "ital">Nevertheless, as truly as I live, and all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, none of those men who have seen my glory and my signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and </span>(<span class= "ital">who</span>)<span class= "ital"> tempted me these ten times, and hearkened not unto my voice, shall see the land which I sware unto their fathers, </span>&c. Some have explained the words <span class= "ital">these ten times </span>by adding to the eight murmurings which are recorded--(1) at the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/14-11.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? why have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?">Exodus 14:11-12</a>); (2) at Marah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-23.htm" title="And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.">Exodus 15:23</a>); (3) in the wilderness of Sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-2.htm" title="And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:">Exodus 16:2</a>); (4) at Rephidim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm" title="And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.">Exodus 17:1</a>); (5) at Horeb (Exodus 32); (6) at Taberah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm" title="And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.">Numbers 11:1</a>); (7) at the graves of lust (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-4.htm" title="And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?">Numbers 11:4</a>); and (8) at Kadesh (Numbers 14)--the transgressions of certain individuals--(1) in keeping the manna until the morning of the day after that on which it was gathered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding they listened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.">Exodus 16:20</a>); and (2) in going out to gather the manna on the seventh day, when none fell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.">Exodus 16:27</a>). It is more probable, however, that the number <span class= "ital">ten </span>is used here, as elsewhere (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-7.htm" title="And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.">Genesis 31:7</a>), as denoting a full measure. The persons to whom the penalty applied are specified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm" title="Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me.">Numbers 14:29</a> : viz., those who were included in the first census. The principal exceptions to the threat of exclusion from the land of promise are specified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/14-30.htm" title="Doubtless you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.">Numbers 14:30-31</a> : viz., Joshua and Caleb, and the generation which had not reached twenty years of age at the exodus. The other exception, or exceptions, if such there were, belonged to the tribe of Levi, which was not included in the census which was first taken, nor represented by the spies. It has been inferred from the fact that Nadab and Abihu only went up into the mountain with Moses and Aaron, that Eleazar, who entered Canaan with Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-1.htm" title="And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.">Joshua 14:1</a>), was under twenty years of age at the exodus. It may be observed that it does not follow that the regulation respecting the age of the Levites at the time of entering upon their service applied also to the priests, and consequently Eleazar <span class= "ital">may </span>have been under twenty years of age at the time of his consecration. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm" title="Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;">2Chronicles 31:17</a>.) There seems, however, to be no sufficient authority for such a supposition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have pardoned.</span> Whatever necessary exceptions and qualifications might remain to be afterwards declared, the great fact that he forgave the nation, and that the nation should not die, is announced without delay and without reservation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to thy word.</span> Such power had God been pleased to give unto man, that at the intercession of the mediator a whole nation is delivered from imminent death and destruction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:20-35 The Lord granted the prayer of Moses so far as not at once to destroy the congregation. But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit. Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished to die in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them at their word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were made to groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy for them to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till they first leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce your ruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, in your unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in. God will let them know that he can put a difference between the guilty and the innocent, and cut them off without touching their children. Thus God would not utterly take away his loving kindness.</body></html>
