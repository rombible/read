Hence it follows that the year and a half which had elapsed since the exodus must be included in the forty years of shepherd life in the wilderness.<p><span class= "bld">My breach of promise.--</span>The noun which is thus rendered occurs only in one other place, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-10.htm" title="Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,">Job 33:10</a>.

Exactly for this reason it was the better fitted to fix itself in the mind of a nation incapable of following a deeper and more spiritual analogy of guilt and punishment. It served the purpose which God had in view, viz., to make them feel that the quantity as well as the quality of their punishment was entirely due to themselves; and it needed no other justification. If God assigns reasons at all, he assigns such as can be understood by those to whom he speaks. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall know</span> <span class="cmt_word">my breach of promise.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The noun only occurs elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-10.htm">Job 33:10</a>, but the verb is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-7.htm">Numbers 32:7</a> in the sense of "discouraging," or "turning away" (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). Here it must mean "my withdrawal," or "my turning aside, from you." They should know by sad experience that "with the froward" God will "show" himself "froward" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:20-35 The Lord granted the prayer of Moses so far as not at once to destroy the congregation. But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit. Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished to die in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them at their word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were made to groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy for them to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till they first leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce your ruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, in your unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in. God will let them know that he can put a difference between the guilty and the innocent, and cut them off without touching their children. Thus God would not utterly take away his loving kindness.</body></html>
