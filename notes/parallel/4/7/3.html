The meaning of the qualifying word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> is extremely doubtful. The Targums render it as the A.V. On the other hand, Gesenius and. De Wette render it "litters," as the similar word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a> (where the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). The reading of the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is equally doubtful. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, itself probably a foreign word, is explained by the Scholiasts as <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span>, or as <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>; and Aquila has here <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">plaustra tecta.</span> But Euseb. Emis. understands it as meaning "two-wheeled vehicles." It is a matter of little importance, but the nature of the country itself and the small number of oxen to each carriage point to the probability that they had no wheels, and were carried by the oxen, one in front, and one behind, by means of shafts, as is still the case in parts of India. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The offering of the princes to the service of the tabernacle was not made till it was fully set up. Necessary observances must always take place of free-will offerings. The more any are advanced, the greater opportunity they have of serving God and their generation. No sooner was the tabernacle set up, than provision is made for the removal of it. Even when but just settled in the world, we must be preparing for changes and removes, especially for the great change.</body></html>
