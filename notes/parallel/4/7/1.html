Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;</span>), has given rise to considerable difficulty. Strictly speaking it should mean the first day of the first month of the second year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>); and so the Targum of Palestine, "It was on the day which begins the month Nisan." It is, however, quite clear from the narrative itself, as well as from its position, that the offerings were not actually made until after the taking of the census and the distribution of their respective duties to the Levitical families, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, until the eve of the departure from Sinai. Moreover, since the same phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, occurs in verse 10, it is certain that it cannot apply to the actual presentation of the offerings, which was spread over twelve days (verse 11). The majority, therefore, of the commentators would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>, "at the time." It is, however, impossible to admit that there is any similarity whatever between the two passages. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a> the context itself, as well as the subject matter, oblige us to understand the phrase in the looser sense; but in a plain historical account such as the present the obligation is all the other way. Either the date here given is a mistake (which, on any supposition, is most improbable), or it must be referred to the intention and inception of the princely offerings, the actual presentation being made at the time indicated in the narrative, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in the first half of the second month. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">had anointed</span> it. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>, as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>, it would rather appear that Moses did not anoint the tabernacle on the day it was set up, but on some subsequent day. It is, however, a mistake to suppose that the tabernacle and the holy things were anointed through seven successive days: the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33-35</a> refers only to the consecration of the priests. Since the anointing of the tabernacle was connected with the setting of it up, as the last act of one ceremonial, and was only unavoidably postponed, there is nothing remarkable in the two things being spoken of as if they had taken place on one and the same day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The offering of the princes to the service of the tabernacle was not made till it was fully set up. Necessary observances must always take place of free-will offerings. The more any are advanced, the greater opportunity they have of serving God and their generation. No sooner was the tabernacle set up, than provision is made for the removal of it. Even when but just settled in the world, we must be preparing for changes and removes, especially for the great change.</body></html>
