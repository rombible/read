But it could still be "dedicated" in another sense by the sacrificial gifts, freely offered for the purpose, of the people. No rules appear to have been made as to dedications, but there is an allusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a> to the dedication of houses, which may have been accompanied with religions rites, and we know that as a fact the temple was dedicated by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-5.htm">2 Chronicles 7:5</a>), and re-dedicated by the Maccabees (1 Macc. 4:54, <span class="accented">sq.</span>), and the wall of Jerusalem was dedicated by Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27</a>, sq.). The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, as in 1 Macc. 4:56, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-22.htm">John 10:22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Offered their offering</span> <span class="cmt_word">before the altar.</span> This assuredly points to an offering made in common, and made at one time, via, on the day when the altar was anointed. It may be that the twelve princes all came for the purpose of making their offerings on that day, the day they would naturally choose for the purpose; but on account of the great number of other sacrifices, and the fewness of the priests, <span class="accented">their</span> offerings were postponed by the Divine command, and were actually received later. Thus in will and in meaning the offerings were made "on the day" of the consecration, but were publicly and solemnly received at some subsequent time. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-89 The princes and great men were most forward in the service of God. Here is an example to those in authority, and of the highest rank; they ought to use their honour and power, their estate and interest, to promote religion and the service of God in the places where they live. Though it was a time of joy and rejoicing, yet still, in the midst of their sacrifices, we find a sin-offering. As, in our best services, we are conscious that there is sin, there should be repentance, even in our most joyful services. In all approaches to God we must by faith look to Christ as the Sin-offering. They brought their offerings each on a day. God's work should not be done confusedly, or in a hurry; take time, and we shall have done the sooner, or, at least, we shall have done the better. If services are to be done for twelve days together, we must not call it a task and a burden. All their offerings were the same; all the tribes of Israel had an equal share in the altar, and an equal interest in the sacrifices offered upon it. He who now spake to Moses, as the Shechinah or Divine Majesty, from between the Cherubim, was the Eternal Word, the second Person in the Trinity; for all God's communion with man is by his Son, by whom he made the world, and rules the church, who is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.</body></html>
