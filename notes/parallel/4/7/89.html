Hebrew, <span class="accented">ohel moed</span>, where God had promised to <span class="accented">meet</span> with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To speak with him,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with God, as implied in the word "meeting." <span class="cmt_word">He heard the voice of one speaking unto him.</span> Rather, "he heard the voice conversing with him," making itself audible to him. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>, part. Hithpael, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Here is a distinct statement of the supernatural fact that God spake to Moses with an audible human voice, and (no doubt) in the Hebrew language, from out the empty darkness behind the veil. In the fact, indeed, of God so speaking audibly there was nothing new (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, etc.), nor in the fact of his so speaking to Moses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> and Exodus 33:9); but this records the fulfillment of that promise which was part of God's covenant with Israel, that he would at all times converse with Moses as their mediator from above the mercy-seat (see on Exodus 25:20-22, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he spake unto him,</span> i.e., God spake unto Moses: the voice made itself audible, and by the voice God himself spake unto him. It is quite obvious that this statement more properly belongs to an earlier period, viz., to that immediately succeeding the consecration of the tabernacle. On the day it was set up Moses was not able to enter it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>), but no doubt he did so very soon afterwards, and received from the mouth of the Lord, speaking in the holiest, all the commandments and ordinances recorded in Leviticus and in the beginning of this book. Perhaps the first communication made to him in this way concerned the offerings of the princes when first brought near (verses 4, 11), and for that reason the statement may have been appended to the record of those offerings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-89 The princes and great men were most forward in the service of God. Here is an example to those in authority, and of the highest rank; they ought to use their honour and power, their estate and interest, to promote religion and the service of God in the places where they live. Though it was a time of joy and rejoicing, yet still, in the midst of their sacrifices, we find a sin-offering. As, in our best services, we are conscious that there is sin, there should be repentance, even in our most joyful services. In all approaches to God we must by faith look to Christ as the Sin-offering. They brought their offerings each on a day. God's work should not be done confusedly, or in a hurry; take time, and we shall have done the sooner, or, at least, we shall have done the better. If services are to be done for twelve days together, we must not call it a task and a burden. All their offerings were the same; all the tribes of Israel had an equal share in the altar, and an equal interest in the sacrifices offered upon it. He who now spake to Moses, as the Shechinah or Divine Majesty, from between the Cherubim, was the Eternal Word, the second Person in the Trinity; for all God's communion with man is by his Son, by whom he made the world, and rules the church, who is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.</body></html>
