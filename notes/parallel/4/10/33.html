The obvious objection to this supposition arising out of the fact that the cloud which directed the march rested upon, or over, the ark may be overcome by the consideration that the cloud appears to have extended over the whole of the host during the journeys, and to have served as a protection from the scorching heat (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-34.htm" title="And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.">Numbers 10:34</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-12.htm" title="Moreover you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.">Nehemiah 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm" title="He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.">Psalm 105:39</a>). On the other hand, the natural interpretation of this verse is that the ark was borne in front of the host, and did not merely serve to direct its line of march as a general, whose station might be in any part of an army. This interpretation is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-33.htm" title="Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in a cloud by day.">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>, and also by the position which the ark occupied at the passage of the Jordan. In the latter case the people were expressly directed to <span class= "ital">go </span>after the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-3.htm" title="And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place, and go after it.">Joshua 3:3</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.">Numbers 10:11</a> the same word is used which occurs in this verse, "the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over <span class= "ital">before </span>you into Jordan." It will not follow, however, as a necessary inference, that the ark uniformly occupied the same position in all the journeys, and it cannot be denied that <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-21.htm" title="And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.">Numbers 10:21</a> presents a difficulty, partly arising from the ambiguity of meaning which is to be attached to the word <span class= "ital">mikdash, sanctuary, </span>and partly from the omission of any word in the Hebrew corresponding to the words in italics, <span class= "ital">the other. </span>Ibn Ezra thinks that this three days' journey was different from all the other journeys in respect of the position of the ark.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they departed.</span> These words mark the moment of actual departure, which has been anticipated in the general statement of verse 12. It was one of the supreme moments in the life of Israel - one of those beginnings or "departures" which lead to untold gain or loss; it was, in fact, although they knew it not, the commencement of a march which for almost all of them should know no end except within a hasty grave. No doubt, during the months spent at Sinai, <span class="accented">every</span> preparation had been made for the onward journey; but none the less it was a stupendous enterprise to march that vast host, so largely composed of women and children, so little inured to such fatigue, and so impatient of such discipline, for three consecutive days into a wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">Three days' journey.</span> This expression is apparently a general <span class="accented">one</span>, and not to be strictly pressed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-36.htm">Genesis 30:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>). At the same time it implies <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the host twice halted for the night during the journey, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the whole journey was regarded as one and in some sense as complete in itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of this three days' journey is given us in verse 12; it was to take them across the intervening belt of sand, and to land them fairly within the "wilderness of Paran." During this journey no doubt the march would be pushed on as steadily as possible, but it is not likely that it would cover so much as thirty miles. A modern army, unencumbered with non-combatants, does not make more than ten miles a day over difficult country, nor can cattle be driven faster than that. Even to accomplish that rate, and to <span class="accented">keep</span> the whole multitude together, as the narrative implies, required supernatural aid and strength. For the direction of the march see notes on chapter 13. <span class="cmt_word">The ark</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the covenant of the Lord went before them.</span> It is obvious that what is apparently affirmed here is apparently at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a> and verse 21 of this chapter, which speak of the holy things - of which the ark was the most holy - as carried by the Kohathites in the very midst of the long line of march. Three opinions have been held on the subject. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the ark was really carried with the other "holy things," and only "went before" metaphorically, as a general may be said to lead his troops, although he may not be actually in front of them; to which it is obvious <span class="cmt_word">to</span> reply that if the ark did not actually precede the host, there was no possible way in which it could direct their movements; the cloud alone would be the visible expression of the Divine guidance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the "holy things" generally were ordered to be carried in the midst of the host by the Kohathites, but that God reserved the place of the ark itself to his own immediate disposition. A general does not include himself in his own marching orders, however minute; and the ark was the outward symbol of God's own personal presence and guidance. It is, therefore, not at all surprising that the first intimation of the position of the ark on the march should be given at the moment when the march actually commenced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That the usual place for the ark was no doubt with the sanctuary, as implied in the orders, but that o a <span class="accented">this special occasion</span> the ark went to the front in consequence of some Divine intimation, just as it did at the crossing of Jordan and at the taking of Jericho. Certainly there is much reason in this view, considering how momentous and formidable was their first assay at marching from their temporary home towards that unknown land beyond the northern horizon. If the deep waters of Jordan might fright them, or the walls of Jericho defy them, well might they shrink from plunging into the broken, stony, and intractable country into which the ark and the cloud now led them. We shall probably think that either habitually or at least occasionally the ark <span class="accented">did</span> go before, and that the feet of them that bare it were supernaturally directed, either by the movements of the cloud, or by some more secret intimation, towards the destined place of rest. It is allowed by all that the cloud preceded and directed the march, and it would be strange indeed if these twin symbols of the Divine presence had been so far separated from one another; for the accustomed place of the cloud was above the tabernacle, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, above the ark, yet outside of the tabernacle, so as to be visible to all. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:33-36 Their going out and coming in, gives an example to us to begin and end every day's journey and every day's work with prayer. Here is Moses's prayer when the ark set forward, Rise up, and let thine enemies be scattered. There are those in the world who are enemies to God and haters of him; secret and open enemies; enemies to his truths, his laws, his ordinances, his people. But for the scattering and defeating of God's enemies, there needs no more than God's arising. Observe also the prayer of Moses when the ark rested, that God would cause his people to rest. The welfare and happiness of the Israel of God, consist in the continual presence of God among them. Their safety is not in their numbers, but in the favour of God, and his gracious return to them, and resting with them. Upon this account, Happy art thou, O Israel! who is like unto thee, O people! God will go before them, to find them resting-places by the way. His promise is, and their prayers are, that he will never leave them nor forsake them.</body></html>
