So also Abijah, in his address to Jeroboam, previously to the battle, lays great stress upon the fact that Judah had on their side the priests with the trumpets of alarm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-12.htm" title="And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you.

In your land. The practical use of the trumpets ceased with the years of wandering; the ceremonial use was continued as long as the people dwelt in "their land;" the spiritual use remains an "ordinance for ever," as long as the Church is militant here on earth. That the use of the two silver trumpets was ceremonial, and not practical, after the conquest of Canaan is evident from the purpose and effect ascribed to that use. Whether in war or in worship, that purpose was <span class="accented">not</span> to convoke the people, nor to give signals to the host, <span class="accented">but</span> to put God in mind of his promises, and to invoke his covenanted grace. Indeed, two trumpets, as here prescribed, could not be otherwise than ceremonially used after the nation was spread abroad over the whole face of Canaan; and there is no direction to make more than two such trumpets. The use of trumpets in subsequent times is indeed often mentioned both in war and in holy festivities, and it was undoubtedly founded upon this Divine ordinance; but it was not in literal compliance with it, for the obvious reason that many trumpets were used instead of two only (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>). In these passages (and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>) we have abundant evidence of one of those expansions and adaptations of the Mosaic ritual which were so freely made under the house of David. Chapter 31:6, and (perhaps) <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-6.htm">1 Chronicles 16:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a> may be quoted as pointing to the strict fulfillment of the law as it stands. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-10 Here are directions concerning the public notices to be given the people by sound of trumpet. Their laws in every case were to be Divine, therefore, even in this matter Moses is directed. These trumpets typify the preached gospel. It sounds an alarm to sinners, calls them to repent, proclaims liberty to the captives and slaves of Satan, and collects the worshippers of God. It directs and encourages their heavenly journey; stirs them up to combat against the world and sin, encouraging them with the assurance of victory. It leads their attention to the sacrifice of Christ, and shows the Lord's presence for their protection. It is also necessary that the gospel trumpet give a distinct sound, according to the persons addressed, or the end proposed; whether to convince, humble, console, exhort, reprove, or teach. The sounding of the trumpet of the gospel is God's ordinance, and demands the attention of all to whom it is sent.</body></html>
