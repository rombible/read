In the former of these cases some suppose that both trumpets were blown, and in the latter only one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-4.htm" title="And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.">Numbers 10:4</a> and Note.

The fuller directions respecting the order in which the camps were to break up are given in Numbers 2. Here the order of the eastern and southern camps only is prescribed. In the LXX., however, we read thus: "And ye shall sound a third alarm, and the camps pitched by the sea (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>westward), shall move forward; and ye shall sound a fourth alarm, and they that encamp toward the north shall move forward; they shall sound an alarm at their departure."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When ye blow an alarm.</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. This seems to signify a continuous peal, easily distinguished, wherever audible, from the blowing in short, sharp tones (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>) mentioned below, verse 7. The peal of alarm was to be blown - <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> - "for their breaking up" - for that purpose, and no other. The camps. Only those on the east (Judah, with Issachar and Zebulun) and on the south (Reuben, with Simeon and Gad) are here mentioned. It may be that the silver trumpets themselves were carried with the sacred utensils after the southern camps, and that some other means were employed to start the remaining tribes; or it may be that the omission is due to some accidental circumstance. The Septuagint inserts in verse 6, "And ye shall sound a third alarm, and the camps which are pitched westwards shall move; and ye shall sound a fourth alarm, and the camps which are pitched northwards shall move." No doubt this was the actual order of starting, however the signal was given. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-10 Here are directions concerning the public notices to be given the people by sound of trumpet. Their laws in every case were to be Divine, therefore, even in this matter Moses is directed. These trumpets typify the preached gospel. It sounds an alarm to sinners, calls them to repent, proclaims liberty to the captives and slaves of Satan, and collects the worshippers of God. It directs and encourages their heavenly journey; stirs them up to combat against the world and sin, encouraging them with the assurance of victory. It leads their attention to the sacrifice of Christ, and shows the Lord's presence for their protection. It is also necessary that the gospel trumpet give a distinct sound, according to the persons addressed, or the end proposed; whether to convince, humble, console, exhort, reprove, or teach. The sounding of the trumpet of the gospel is God's ordinance, and demands the attention of all to whom it is sent.</body></html>
