A similar reason restrained the Nazirite. <span class="cmt_word">Because the consecration of his God is upon his head,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.,<span class="cmt_word"></span></span> because he wears the unshorn locks which are the outward sign of his separation unto God. The hair of the Nazirite was to him just what the diadem on the mitre was to the high priest, what the sacred chrism was to the sons of Aaron. Both of these are called by the word <span class="accented">nezer</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-12.htm">Leviticus 21:12</a>), from the same root as <span class="accented">nazir.</span> It was thought by some of the Jewish doctors that in these three particulars - the untouched growth of the hair, the abstinence from the fruit of the vine (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-20.htm">Genesis 9:20</a>), and the seclusion from the dead - the separated life of the Nazirite reproduced the unfallen life of man in paradise. This may have had some foundation in fact, but the true explanation of the three rules is rather to be found in the spiritual truth they teach in a simple and forcible way. He who has a holy ambition to please God must <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> devote to God the whole forces of his being, undiminished by any wont and use of the world; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> abstain not only from pleasures which are actually dangerous, but from such as have any savour of moral evil about them; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> subordinate his most sacred private feelings to the great purpose of his life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-21 The word Nazarite signifies separation. Some were appointed of God, before their birth, to be Nazarites all their days, as Samson and John the Baptist. But, in general, it was a vow of separation from the world and devotedness to the services of religion, for a limited time, and under certain rules, which any person might make if they pleased. A Nazarite is spoken of as well known; but his obligation is brought to a greater certainty than before. That the fancies of superstitious men might not multiply the restraints endlessly, God gives them rules. They must not drink wine or strong drink, nor eat grapes. Those who separate themselves to God, must not gratify the desires of the body, but keep it under. Let all Christians be very moderate in the use of wine and strong drink; for if the love of these once gets the mastery of a man, he becomes an easy prey to Satan. The Nazarites were to eat nothing that came of the vine; this may teach the utmost care to avoid sin, and all that borders upon it, and leads to it, or may be a temptation to us. They must not cut their hair. They must neither poll their heads, nor shave their beards; this was the mark of Samson being a Nazarite. This signified neglect of the body, and of the ease and ornament of it. Those who separate themselves to God, must keep their consciences pure from dead works, and not touch unclean things. All the days of their separation they must be holy to the Lord. This was the meaning of those outward observances, and without this they were of no account. No penalty or sacrifice was appointed for those who wilfully broke their vow of being Nazarites; they must answer another day for such profane trifling with the Lord their God; but those were to be relieved who did not sin wilfully. There is nothing in Scripture that bears the least resemblance to the religious orders of the church of Rome, except these Nazarites. But mark the difference, or rather how completely opposed! The religious of that church are forbidden to marry; but no such restriction is laid upon the Nazarites. They are commanded to abstain from meats; but the Nazarites might eat any food allowed other Israelites. They are not generally forbidden wine, not even on their fasting days; but the Nazarites might not have wine at any time. Their vow is lasting, even to the end of their lives; the Nazarites' vow was only for a limited time, at their own will; and in certain cases not unless allowed by husbands or parents. Such a thorough difference there is between rules of man's invention and those directed in Scripture, Let us not forget that the Lord Jesus is not only our Surety, but also our example. For his sake we must renounce worldly pleasures, abstain from fleshy lusts, be separate from sinners, make open profession of our faith, moderate natural affections, be spiritually-minded, and devoted to God's service, and desirous to be an example all around us.</body></html>
