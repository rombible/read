As it concerned the priests and their daily ministration, it would be natural to suppose that it was given at the time when the tabernacle service was set up, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at the precise point fixed by the first verse of the following chapter. That the command was given to Moses, and to Moses alone, and that <span class="accented">after</span> the consecration of Aaron to the high priesthood, serves to bring out into clear relief the relative position of the two. Aaron and his sons alone, as the "official" representatives of the Lord, could bless in his name and put . his name upon the people; but the formula of blessing was delivered to Aaron himself through Moses, as the "personal" representative of the Lord, the mediator of the old covenant. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>).

To be under the almighty protection of God our Saviour; to enjoy his favour as the smile of a loving Father, or as the cheering beams of the sun; while he mercifully forgives our sins, supplies our wants, consoles the heart, and prepares us by his grace for eternal glory; these things form the substance of this blessing, and the sum total of all blessings. In so rich a list of mercies worldly joys are not worthy to be mentioned. Here is a form of prayer. The name Jehovah is three times repeated. The Jews think there is some mystery; and we know what it is, the New Testament having explained it. There we are directed to expect the blessing from the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, 2Co 13:14; each of which Persons is Jehovah, and yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord.</body></html>
