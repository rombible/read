It is obvious that it cannot be proved, and that it would not even have suggested any such idea to the priest who gave, or to the people who received, the benediction. To them the threefold form merely added beauty and fullness to the blessing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>). But that is not the question. The real question is whether the Old Testament was written for our sakes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15, 16</a>), and whether the God of the Jews was indeed the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-54.htm">John 8:54</a>). If so, it is not possible for us to avoid seeing in this benediction a declaration of the threefold Being of God, and it is not possible to avoid believing that he meant us to see such a declaration, veiled indeed from the eyes of the Jew, but clear enough to the Christian. For a somewhat similar case compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:22-27 The priests were solemnly to bless the people in the name of the Lord. To be under the almighty protection of God our Saviour; to enjoy his favour as the smile of a loving Father, or as the cheering beams of the sun; while he mercifully forgives our sins, supplies our wants, consoles the heart, and prepares us by his grace for eternal glory; these things form the substance of this blessing, and the sum total of all blessings. In so rich a list of mercies worldly joys are not worthy to be mentioned. Here is a form of prayer. The name Jehovah is three times repeated. The Jews think there is some mystery; and we know what it is, the New Testament having explained it. There we are directed to expect the blessing from the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, 2Co 13:14; each of which Persons is Jehovah, and yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord.</body></html>
