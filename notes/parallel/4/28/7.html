but it is more frequently used to denote a drink which is not made from grapes, as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm" title="Do not drink wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:">Leviticus 10:9</a>, where the command is given to Aaron and his sons not to drink "wine nor strong drink" (<span class= "ital">shecar</span>) when they went into the tent of meeting. In the parallel passage in Exodus, the drink offering was to consist of "the fourth part of an hin of wine" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-40.htm" title="And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.">Numbers 29:40</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-5.htm" title="And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shall you prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.">Numbers 15:5</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-9.htm" title="You shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall you pour drink offering thereon.">Exodus 30:9</a> it is forbidden to pour any drink offering upon the altar of incense, from which passage it has been inferred that the drink offerings were poured upon the altar of burnt sacrifice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the holy place.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>. Josephus paraphrases this by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> ('Ant.,' 3:10), and so the Targum of Onkelos; Jonathan and the Targum of Palestine render, "from the vessels of the sanctuary." The former would seem to be the real meaning of the original. There is nowhere any specific direction as to the ritual of the drink offering (see on Leviticus 23, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-7.htm">Numbers 15:7, 10</a>), nor is it certain whether it was poured at the foot of the altar (as apparently stated in Ecclus. 1. 15) or poured upon the flesh of the sacrifice on the altar (as seems to be implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The strong wine.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The Targums render it "old wine," because the drink offering was in every other instance ordered to be made with wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">Shecar</span>, however, was not wine, but strong drink other than wine (such as we call "spirits"), and it is invariably used in that sense in contradistinction to wine (see on Leviticus 10:9; Numbers 6:3, etc.). It can only be supposed that the difficulty of procuring wine in the wilderness had caused the coarser and commoner liquor to be substituted for it. It is certainly remarkable that the mention of <span class="accented">shecar</span> should be retained at a time when wine must have been easily obtainable, and was about to become abundant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>). As it would seem impossible that <span class="accented">shecar</span> should have been substituted for wine after the settlement in Canaan, its mention here may be accepted as evidence of the wilderness-origin of this particular ordinance. The quantity ordained (about a quart for each lamb) was very considerable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-8 God saw fit now to repeat the law of sacrifices. This was a new generation of men; and they were concerned to keep their peace with God when at war with their enemies. The daily sacrifice is called a continual burnt-offering; when we are bid to pray always, at least every morning and evening we should offer up solemn prayers and praises to God. Nothing is added here but that the wine poured out in the drink-offering is to be strong wine, to teach us to serve God with the best we have. It was a figure of the blood of Christ, the memorial of which is still left to the church in wine; and of the blood of the martyrs, which was poured out as a drink-offering on the sacrifice and service of our faith, Php 2:17.</body></html>
