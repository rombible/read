There can be no doubt that this (unlike the sabbath) was a nature-festival, observed more or less by all nations. As such it did not require to be instituted, but only to be regulated and sanctified in order that it might not lend itself to idolatry, as it did among the heathen (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>). The new-moon feast, depending upon no calendar but that of the sky, and more clearly marked in that than any other recurring period, was certain to fix itself deeply in the social and religious habits of a simple pastoral or agricultural people. Accordingly we find it incidentally mentioned as a day of social gathering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-5.htm">1 Samuel 20:5</a>), and as a day for religious instruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>). From the latter passage, and from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>, it is evident that the feast of the new moon became to the month exactly what the sabbath was to the week - a day of rest and of worship (see also Judith 8:6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:9-15 Every sabbath day, beside the two lambs offered for the daily burnt-offering, there must be two more offered. This teaches us to double our devotions on sabbath days, for so the duty of the day requires. The sabbath rest is to be observed, in order more closely to apply ourselves to the sabbath work, which ought to fill up the sabbath time. The offerings in the new moons showed thankfulness for the renewing of earthly blessings: when we rejoice in the gifts of providence, we must make the sacrifice of Christ, that great gift of special grace, the fountain and spring-head of our joy. And the worship performed in the new moons is made typical of gospel solemnities, Isa 66:23. As the moon borrows light from the sun, and is renewed by its influences; so the church borrows her light from Jesus Christ, who is the Sun of righteousness, renewing the state of the church, especially under the gospel.</body></html>
