See on Numbers 7:16. This was probably offered first in order, according to the usual analogy of such sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-10.htm">Exodus 29:10-14</a>). There is no authority for supposing that this sin offering superseded the one mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-24.htm">Numbers 15:24</a> <span class="accented">sq. This</span> was essentially part of the customary routine of sacrifice; that was essentially occasional, and proper to some unforeseen contingency. It is likely enough that the national conscience would in fact content itself with the first, but it does not in the least follow that such was the intention of the legislator. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:9-15 Every sabbath day, beside the two lambs offered for the daily burnt-offering, there must be two more offered. This teaches us to double our devotions on sabbath days, for so the duty of the day requires. The sabbath rest is to be observed, in order more closely to apply ourselves to the sabbath work, which ought to fill up the sabbath time. The offerings in the new moons showed thankfulness for the renewing of earthly blessings: when we rejoice in the gifts of providence, we must make the sacrifice of Christ, that great gift of special grace, the fountain and spring-head of our joy. And the worship performed in the new moons is made typical of gospel solemnities, Isa 66:23. As the moon borrows light from the sun, and is renewed by its influences; so the church borrows her light from Jesus Christ, who is the Sun of righteousness, renewing the state of the church, especially under the gospel.</body></html>
