Whatever else was offered was in addition to it, not in lieu of it. The sabbath and festival use of the Jews was developed out of the ferial use, and rested upon it. Hence in a connected republication of the law of offering it could not be omitted. <span class="cmt_word">Without spot.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>.

This necessary qualification had not been expressed in the original ordinance, but in respect of other sacrifices had been continually required (see on Exodus 12:5; Leviticus 1:3; chapter Numbers 19:2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-8 God saw fit now to repeat the law of sacrifices. This was a new generation of men; and they were concerned to keep their peace with God when at war with their enemies. The daily sacrifice is called a continual burnt-offering; when we are bid to pray always, at least every morning and evening we should offer up solemn prayers and praises to God. Nothing is added here but that the wine poured out in the drink-offering is to be strong wine, to teach us to serve God with the best we have. It was a figure of the blood of Christ, the memorial of which is still left to the church in wine; and of the blood of the martyrs, which was poured out as a drink-offering on the sacrifice and service of our faith, Php 2:17.</body></html>
