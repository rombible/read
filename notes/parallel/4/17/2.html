'The words used for scepter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>, and for rod in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, and elsewhere are different, but the same imagery underlies the use of all of them. <span class="cmt_word">Of all</span> <span class="cmt_word">their princes... twelve rods.</span> These princes must be those named in chapter 2 and 7. Since among these are to be found the tribe princes of Ephraim and Manasseh, standing upon a perfect equality with the rest, it is evident that the twelve rods were exclusive of that of Aaron. The joining together of Ephraim and Manasseh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a> was a very different thing, because it could not raise any question as between the two. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 It is an instance of the grace of God, that, having wrought divers miracles to punish sin, he would work one more to prevent it. Twelve rods or staves were to be brought in. It is probable that they were the staves which the princes used as ensigns of their authority; old dry staves, that had no sap in them. They were to expect that the rod of the tribe, or prince, whom God chose to the priesthood, should bud and blossom. Moses did not object that the matter was sufficiently settled already; he did not undertake to determine it; but left the case before the Lord.</body></html>
