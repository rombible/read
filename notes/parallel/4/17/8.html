The miraculous shooting forth of Aaron's dry rod may be regarded as a type of the mode of the Spirit's operation in the Church, and more especially in the work of the ministry; "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And yielded almonds.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">and brought almonds to maturity, </span>or <span class= "ital">yielded ripe almonds. </span>The word <span class= "ital">shaked </span>(almond-tree) is a cognate form of the verb <span class= "ital">shakad</span>--<span class= "ital">to keep watch. </span>The name is supposed to have been given to the almond-tree because it blossoms at a time when vegetation is lying in the sleep of winter. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/1-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.">Jeremiah 1:11-12</a>; also, <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book, </span>p. 319.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was budded:</span> or "sprouted." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And yielded almonds.</span> Rather, "matured almonds." This particular rod had been cut from an almond tree, and it would seem probable that it had on it shoots and flowers and fruit at once, so that the various stages of its natural growth were all exemplified together. The almond has its Hebrew name <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, "awake," from the well-known fact of its being the first of all trees to awake from the winter sleep of nature, and to herald the vernal resurrection with its conspicuous show of snow-white blossoms, which even anticipate the leaves (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>). Thus the "rod of an almond-tree" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>) was shown to the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>) as the evident symbol of the vigilant haste with which the purposes of God were to be developed and matured. It is possible that all the tribe princes had official "rods" of the almond-tree to denote their watchful alacrity in duty, and that these were the rods which they brought to Moses. In any case the flowering and fruiting of Aaron's rod, while it was an unquestionable miracle (for if not a miracle, it could only have been a disgraceful imposture), was a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, in the true sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a miracle which was also a parable. Aaron's rod could no more blossom and fruit by nature than any of the others, since it also had been severed from the living tree; and so in Aaron himself was no more power or goodness than in the rest of Israel. But as the rod germinated and matured its fruit by the power of God, supernaturally starting and accelerating the natural forces of vegetable life, even so in Aaron the grace of God was quick and fruitful to put forth, not the signs only and promise of spiritual gifts and energies, but the ripened fruits as well. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8-13 While all the other rods remained as they were. Aaron's rod became a living branch. In some places there were buds, in others blossoms, in others fruit, at the same time; all this was miraculous. Thus Aaron was manifested to be under the special blessing of Heaven. Fruitfulness is the best evidence of a Divine call; and the plants of God's setting, and the boughs cut off them, will flourish. This rod was preserved, to take away the murmurings of the people, that they might not die. The design of God, in all his providences, and in the memorials of them, is to take away sin. Christ was manifested to take away sin. Christ is expressly called a rod out of the stem of Jesse: little prospect was there, according to human views, that he should ever flourish. But the dry rod revived and blossomed to the confusion of his adversaries. The people cry, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish! This was the language of a repining people, quarrelling with the judgments of God, which by their own pride and obstinacy they brought upon themselves. It is very wicked to fret against God when we are in affliction, and in our distress thus to trespass yet more. If we die, if we perish, it is of ourselves, and the blame will be upon our own heads. When God judges, he will overcome, and will oblige the most obstinate gainsayers to confess their folly. And how great are our mercies, that we have a clearer and a better dispensation, established upon better promises!</body></html>
