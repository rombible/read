It is not stated here that the rod was put within the ark. Nor is it so stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.">Exodus 16:33</a> with regard to the pot of manna. Neither of these was within the ark when it was brought into Solomon's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm" title="There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.">1Kings 8:9</a>); but this statement is by no means inconsistent with that contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>, inasmuch as the assertion that there was nothing but the tables of the law in the ark at that time does not prove that there were not other things in it at an earlier period, and may be thought to suggest the inference that such was actually the case. The Jews have a tradition that when King Josiah ordered the ark to be put in the house which King Solomon built, the rod of Aaron and the pot of manna and the anointing oil were hidden with the ark, and that at that time the rod of Aaron had buds and almonds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the testimony.</span> By comparison with verse 7 this should mean before the ark in which the "testimony" lay. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, however, the rod is said to have been in the ark, although before Solo-men's time it had disappeared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a>). We may suppose that after it had been inspected by the princes it was deposited for safer preservation and easier conveyance inside the sacred chest. <span class="cmt_word">To be kept for a</span> <span class="cmt_word">token against the rebels.</span> Rather, "against the rebellious," literally, "children of rebellion" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2, 3</a>). It could only serve as a token as long as it retained the evidences of having sprouted and fruited, either miraculously in a fresh state, or naturally in a withered state. As a fact, however, it does not appear that the lesson ever needed to be learnt again, and therefore we may suppose that the rod was left first to shrivel with age, and then to be lost through some accident. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8-13 While all the other rods remained as they were. Aaron's rod became a living branch. In some places there were buds, in others blossoms, in others fruit, at the same time; all this was miraculous. Thus Aaron was manifested to be under the special blessing of Heaven. Fruitfulness is the best evidence of a Divine call; and the plants of God's setting, and the boughs cut off them, will flourish. This rod was preserved, to take away the murmurings of the people, that they might not die. The design of God, in all his providences, and in the memorials of them, is to take away sin. Christ was manifested to take away sin. Christ is expressly called a rod out of the stem of Jesse: little prospect was there, according to human views, that he should ever flourish. But the dry rod revived and blossomed to the confusion of his adversaries. The people cry, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish! This was the language of a repining people, quarrelling with the judgments of God, which by their own pride and obstinacy they brought upon themselves. It is very wicked to fret against God when we are in affliction, and in our distress thus to trespass yet more. If we die, if we perish, it is of ourselves, and the blame will be upon our own heads. When God judges, he will overcome, and will oblige the most obstinate gainsayers to confess their folly. And how great are our mercies, that we have a clearer and a better dispensation, established upon better promises!</body></html>
