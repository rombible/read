I behold him </span>(or, <span class= "ital">it</span>)<span class= "ital">, but not nigh. </span>The reference cannot be to Israel, whose armies were encamped before the eyes of Balaam. His words must be understood as having reference to One whom he beheld with the eyes of his mind, not with his bodily sight. This is obvious from the words which follow. Balaam beholds in vision a Star and a Sceptre, not as having already appeared, but as about to appear in the future.<p><span class= "bld">There shall come a Star out of Jacob . . . --</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">There hath come forth a Star out of Jacob, </span>&c. The verb is in the prophetic past or historic tense of prophecy, denoting the certainty of the event predicted. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-14.htm" title="And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints,">Jude 1:14</a> : "Behold the Lord cometh"--literally, <span class= "ital">came.</span>) If there is any ambiguity in the first symbol it is removed in the second. A star is a fitting image of an illustrious king or ruler, and the mention of the <span class= "ital">sceptre </span>in the words which follow (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>) shows that it is so employed in the present instance. The Targum of Onkelos is as follows:--"When the King shall arise out of Jacob, and the Messiah shall be anointed from Israel." The Targum of Palestine reads thus:--"A King is to arise from the house of Jacob, and a Redeemer and Ruler from the house of Israel." Ibn Ezra interprets these words of David, but he says that many interpret them of the Messiah. It seems to have been with reference to this prophecy that the pretender to the title of the Messiah in the days of the Emperor Adrian took the name of <span class= "ital">Bar-cochab, </span>or <span class= "ital">Bar-cochba </span>(the son of a star). The words of the Magi, "We have seen his star in the East" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-2.htm" title="Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.">Matthew 2:2</a>), appear to have reference to this prophecy.<p><span class= "bld">And shall smite the corners of Moab.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">the two sides of Moab. </span>The prophecy was partially, or typically, fulfilled in the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm" title="And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.">2Samuel 8:2</a>). Moab and Edom represented symbolically the enemies of Christ and of His Church, and as such will eventually be subdued by the King of kings. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm" title="Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph you because of me.">Psalm 60:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And destroy all the children of Sheth.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and destroy </span>(or, <span class= "ital">break down; </span>comp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-5.htm" title="For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.">Isaiah 22:5</a>) <span class= "ital">all the sons of tumult. </span>Such appears to be the most probable rendering of these words according to the present Hebrew text. It has been conjectured, however, that the word which is rendered "destroy" (<span class= "ital">karkar</span>) should be read <span class= "ital">kodkod </span>(crown of the head), as in the parallel passage of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm" title="They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the middle of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.">Jeremiah 48:45</a>, in which case the clause may be rendered, <span class= "ital">And the crown of the head of all the sons of tumult.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh.</span> Rather, "I see him, but not now: I behold him, but not near" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>...<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> exactly as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-9.htm">Numbers 23:9</a>). Balaam does not mean to say that he expected himself to see at any future time the mysterious Being of whom he speaks, who is identical with the "Star" and the "Scepter" of the following clauses; he speaks wholly as a prophet, and means that his inner gaze is fixed upon such an one, with full assurance that he exists in the counsels of God, but with clear recognition of the fact that his actual coming is yet in the far future. <span class="cmt_word">There shall come a Star out</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Jacob.</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It may quite as well be rendered by the present; Balaam simply utters what passes before his inward vision. The star is a natural and common poetic symbol of an illustrious, or, as we say, "brilliant," personage, and as such recurs many times in Scripture (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>). The celebrated Jewish fanatic called himself Barcochab, "son of the Star," in allusion to this prophecy. <span class="cmt_word">A Scepter shall rise out of Israel.</span> This further defines the "star ' as a ruler of men, for the scepter is Used in that sense in the dying prophecy of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), with which Balaam was evidently acquainted. Accordingly the Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Shall smite the corners of Moab.</span> Rather, "the two corners" (dual), or "the two sides of Moab," i.e., shall crush Moab on either side. <span class="cmt_word">And destroy all the children of Sheth.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>, where this prophecy is in a manner quoted, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">qarqar</span>, destroy) is altered into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">quadqod</span>, crown of the head). This raises a very curious and interesting question as to the use made by the prophets of the earlier Scriptures, but it gives no authority for an alteration of the text. The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> has been variously rendered. The Jewish commentators, followed by the Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;</span>) and the older versions, understand it to mean the sons of Seth, the son of Adam, i.e., all mankind. Many modern commentators, however, take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> as a contraction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-47.htm">Lamentations 3:47</a> - "desolation"), and read "sons of confusion," as equivalent to the unruly neighbours and relations of Israel. This, however, is extremely dubious in itself, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> nowhere occurs in this sense, and derives no sup. port from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>. It is true that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> is there replaced by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, "sons of tumult," but then this very verse affords the clearest evidence that the prophet felt no hesitation in altering the text of Scripture to suit his own inspired purpose. If it be true that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> will not bear the meaning given to it in the Targums of "reign over," still there is no insuperable difficulty in the common rendering. Jewish prophecy, from beginning to end, contemplated the Messiah as the Conqueror, the Subduer, and even the Destroyer of all the heathen, i.e., of all who were not Jews. It is only in the New Testament that the iron scepter with which he was to dash in pieces the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>) becomes the pastoral staff wherewith he shepherds them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a> - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> after the Septuagint, which has here misread the text). The prophecy was that Messiah should destroy the heathen; the fulfillment that he destroyed not them, but their heathenism (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6-9</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-25 Under the powerful influence of the Spirit of prophecy, Balaam foretold the future prosperity and extensive dominion of Israel. Balaam boasts that his eyes are open. The prophets were in old times called seers. He had heard the words of God, which many do who neither heed them, nor hear God in them. He knew the knowledge of the Most High. A man may be full of the knowledge of God, yet utterly destitute of the grace of God. He calls God the Most High and the Almighty. No man could seem to express a greater respect to God; yet he had no true fear of him, love to him, nor faith in him; so far a man may go toward heaven, and yet come short of it at last. Here is Balaam's prophecy concerning Him who should be the crown and glory of his people Israel; who is David in the type; but our Lord Jesus, the promised Messiah, is chiefly pointed at, and of him it is an illustrious prophecy. Balaam, a wicked man, shall see Christ, but shall not see him nigh; not see him as Job, who saw him as his Redeemer, and saw him for himself. When he comes in the clouds, every eye shall see him; but many will see him, as the rich man in hell saw Abraham, afar off. He shall come out of Jacob, and Israel, as a Star and a Sceptre; the former denoting his glory and lustre; the latter his power and authority. Christ shall be King, not only of Jacob and Israel, but of all the world; so that all shall be either governed by his golden sceptre, or dashed in pieces by his iron rod. Balaam prophesied concerning the Amalekites and Kenites, part of whose country he had now in view. Even a nest in a rock will not be a lasting security. Here is a prophecy that looks as far forward as to the Greeks and Romans. He acknowledges all the revolutions of states and kingdoms to be the Lord's doing. These events will make such desolations, that scarcely any will escape. They that live then, will be as brands plucked out of the fire. May God fit us for the worst of times! Thus Balaam, instead of cursing the church, curses Amalek the first, and Rome the last enemy of the church. Not Rome pagan only, but Rome papal also; antichrist and all the antichristian powers. Let us ask ourselves, Do we in knowledge, experience, or profession, excel Balaam? No readiness of speech, even in preaching or prayer, no gifts of knowledge or prophecy, are in themselves different from, or superior to the boasted gifts of him who loved the wages of unrighteousness, and died the enemy of God. Simple dependence on the Redeemer's atoning blood and sanctifying grace, cheerful submission to the Divine will, constant endeavours to glorify God and benefit his people, these are less splendid, but far more excellent gifts, and always accompany salvation. No boasting hypocrite ever possessed these; yet the feeblest believer has something of them, and is daily praying for more of them.</body></html>
