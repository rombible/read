The name probably applies to the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean generally. The rendering of the Vulgate is <span class= "ital">Venient in trieribus de Italia; </span>and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm" title="For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.">Daniel 11:30</a>, which is obviously founded upon this verse, the Vulgate identifies the <span class= "ital">Kittim </span>with the <span class= "ital">Romans.</span><p><span class= "bld">And shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.--</span>Some understand by <span class= "ital">Eber </span>the <span class= "ital">Hebrews </span>only. The word, however, appears to be used in a wider signification, as comprising "all the children of Eber" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm" title="To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.">Genesis 10:21</a>). Perhaps the word <span class= "ital">Asshur </span>may here be used to denote the <span class= "ital">Eastern Shemites, </span>and <span class= "ital">Eber </span>the <span class= "ital">Western Shemites.</span><p><span class= "bld">And he also shall perish for ever--</span><span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the victorious power which was to afflict Asshur and Eber. "The overthrow of this last power of the world," says Keil, <span class= "ital">in loc., </span>"concerning which the prophet Daniel was the first to receive and proclaim new revelations, belongs 'to the end of the days,' in which the star out of Jacob is to rise upon Israel as 'a bright morning-star'" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm" title="I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.">Revelation 22:16</a>). There is no evidence as to the manner in which Balaam's prophecies came into the hands of the Israelites. It is possible that he may have communicated them to Moses, in the expectation of receiving from him the reward which he had failed to obtain from Balak, or, if captured, in the hope of thereby saving his life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Chittim.</span> Cyprus (see on Genesis 10:4). The "isles of Chittim are mentioned by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a>) and by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>) in the sense apparently of the western islands generally while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a> "the ships of Chittim, may have an even wider reference. Indeed the Targum of Palestine makes mention of Italy here, and the Vulgate actually translates "venient in trieribus de Italia." There is, however, no reason to suppose that Balaam knew or spoke of anything further than Cyprus. It was "from the side of" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) Cyprus that the ships of his vision came down upon the Phoenician coasts, wherever their original starting-point may have been. Shall afflict, or, "shall bring low." The same word is used of the oppression of Israel in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Eber.</span> The Septuagint has here '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, and is followed by the Peschito and the Vulgate. It is not likely, however, that Balaam would have substituted "Eber" for the "Jacob" and "Israel" which he had previously used. The Targum of Onkelos paraphrases "Eber" by "beyond the Euphrates," and that of Palestine has "all the sons of Eber." From Gem 10:21 it would appear that "the children of Eber" were the same as the Shemites; Asshur, therefore, was himself included in Eber, but is separately mentioned on account of his fame and power. <span class="cmt_word">And he also shall perish forever.</span> The subject of this prophecy is left in obscurity. It is difficult on grammatical grounds to refer it to Asshur, and it does not seem appropriate to "Eber." It may mean that the unnamed conquering race which should overthrow the Asian monarchies should itself come to an end for evermore; or it may be that Balaam added these words while he beheld with dismay the coming destruction of his own Shemitic race, and their final subjugation by more warlike powers. It must be remembered that the Greek empire, although overthrown, did not by any means "perish for ever" in the same sense as the previous empires of the East. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:15-25 Under the powerful influence of the Spirit of prophecy, Balaam foretold the future prosperity and extensive dominion of Israel. Balaam boasts that his eyes are open. The prophets were in old times called seers. He had heard the words of God, which many do who neither heed them, nor hear God in them. He knew the knowledge of the Most High. A man may be full of the knowledge of God, yet utterly destitute of the grace of God. He calls God the Most High and the Almighty. No man could seem to express a greater respect to God; yet he had no true fear of him, love to him, nor faith in him; so far a man may go toward heaven, and yet come short of it at last. Here is Balaam's prophecy concerning Him who should be the crown and glory of his people Israel; who is David in the type; but our Lord Jesus, the promised Messiah, is chiefly pointed at, and of him it is an illustrious prophecy. Balaam, a wicked man, shall see Christ, but shall not see him nigh; not see him as Job, who saw him as his Redeemer, and saw him for himself. When he comes in the clouds, every eye shall see him; but many will see him, as the rich man in hell saw Abraham, afar off. He shall come out of Jacob, and Israel, as a Star and a Sceptre; the former denoting his glory and lustre; the latter his power and authority. Christ shall be King, not only of Jacob and Israel, but of all the world; so that all shall be either governed by his golden sceptre, or dashed in pieces by his iron rod. Balaam prophesied concerning the Amalekites and Kenites, part of whose country he had now in view. Even a nest in a rock will not be a lasting security. Here is a prophecy that looks as far forward as to the Greeks and Romans. He acknowledges all the revolutions of states and kingdoms to be the Lord's doing. These events will make such desolations, that scarcely any will escape. They that live then, will be as brands plucked out of the fire. May God fit us for the worst of times! Thus Balaam, instead of cursing the church, curses Amalek the first, and Rome the last enemy of the church. Not Rome pagan only, but Rome papal also; antichrist and all the antichristian powers. Let us ask ourselves, Do we in knowledge, experience, or profession, excel Balaam? No readiness of speech, even in preaching or prayer, no gifts of knowledge or prophecy, are in themselves different from, or superior to the boasted gifts of him who loved the wages of unrighteousness, and died the enemy of God. Simple dependence on the Redeemer's atoning blood and sanctifying grace, cheerful submission to the Divine will, constant endeavours to glorify God and benefit his people, these are less splendid, but far more excellent gifts, and always accompany salvation. No boasting hypocrite ever possessed these; yet the feeblest believer has something of them, and is daily praying for more of them.</body></html>
