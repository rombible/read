</span>or, <span class= "ital">he shall flow with water from his buckets. </span>The nation is personified as a man carrying two buckets full of water, which was the type and leading source of blessing and prosperity in the East. This is a beautiful image, as Bishop Wordsworth has observed, of the true Israel "pouring out the living waters of salvation, the pure streams of the Spirit, and making the wilderness of the world to rejoice and be glad."<p><span class= "bld">His seed shall be in many waters.--</span>This may mean that Israel should inhabit Canaan--"a land of brooks of water" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm" title="For the LORD your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-11.htm" title="But the land, where you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of heaven:">Deuteronomy 11:11</a>); or it may mean that, like seed sown and trees planted by the waters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-20.htm" title="Blessed are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.">Isaiah 32:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-4.htm" title="And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.">Isaiah 44:4, Isa_65:22-23</a>), they should inherit the richest blessings.<p><span class= "bld">His king shall be higher than</span> <span class= "bld">Agag . . .</span>-Agag appears to have been the title (<span class= "ital">nomen dignitatis</span>) of the Amalekite kings, as <span class= "ital">Pharaoh </span>of the Egyptian and <span class= "ital">Abimelech </span>of the Philistine kings. The reference does not seem to be to any particular king, but to the kingdom which should hereafter be established in Israel--to the kings, generally, which should come out of the loins of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-6.htm" title="And I will make you exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come out of you.">Genesis 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm" title="And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins;">Genesis 35:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall pour the water,</span> or, "the water shall overflow." <span class="cmt_word">Out of his buckets.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> is the dual, "his two buckets." The image, familiar enough to one who lived in an irrigated land, is of one carrying two buckets on the ends of a pole which are so full as to run over as he goes. <span class="cmt_word">And his seed... in many waters.</span> It is uncertain in what sense the word "seed" issued. It may be an image as simple as the last, of seed sown either by or actually upon many waters (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a>), and so securing a plentiful and safe return; or it may stand for the seed, i.e., the posterity, of Israel, which should grow up amidst many blessings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>). The former seems most in keeping here. His king shall be higher than Agag. Rather, "let his king be higher than Agag." The name Agag (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span>, the fiery one) does not occur again except as the name of the king of Amalek whom Saul conquered and Samuel slew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.); yet it may safely be assumed that it was the official title of all the kings of Amalek, resembling in this "Abimelech" and "Pharaoh." Here it seems to stand for the dynasty and the nation of the Amalekites, and there is no reason to suppose that any reference was intended to any particular individual or event in the distant future. The "king" of Israel here spoken of is certainly not Saul or any other of the kings, but God himself in his character as temporal Ruler of Israel; and the "kingdom" is the kingdom of heaven as set forth by way of anticipation in the polity and order of the chosen race. As a fact, Israel had afterwards a visible king who overthrew Agag, but their having such a king was alien to the mind of God, and due to a distinct falling away from national faith, and therefore could find no place in this prophecy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 Now Balaam spake not his own sense, but the language of the Spirit that came upon him. Many have their eyes open who have not their hearts open; are enlightened, but not sanctified. That knowledge which puffs men up with pride, will but serve to light them to hell, whither many go with their eyes open. The blessing is nearly the same as those given before. He admires in Israel, their beauty. The righteous, doubtless, is more excellent than his neighbour. Their fruitfulness and increase. Their honour and advancement. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their courage and security. The righteous are bold as a lion, not when assaulting others, but when at rest, because God maketh them to dwell in safety. Their influence upon their neighbours. God takes what is done to them, whether good or evil, as done to himself.</body></html>
