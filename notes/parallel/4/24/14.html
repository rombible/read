The Vulgate here has followed the surmise of the Jewish commentators, who saw nothing in Balaam but the arch-enemy of their race, and has actually altered the text into "dabo consilium quid populus tuus populo huic faciat" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:10-14 This vain attempt to curse Israel is ended.
