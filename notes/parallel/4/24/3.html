It occurs in the Pentateuch only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:">Genesis 22:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm" title="Say to them, As truly as I live, said the LORD, as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:">Numbers 14:28</a>, and in this chapter, where it is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/24-3.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:">Numbers 24:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/24-15.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:">Numbers 24:15-16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The man whose eyes are open.--</span>There is great diversity of opinion respecting the meaning of the word which is here rendered <span class= "ital">open, </span>and which, as it is here written, occurs in no other place. If <span class= "ital">shatham </span>is identified with <span class= "ital">satham, </span>it means to close, not to open. The meaning, however, of this verse is sufficiently explained by that which follows, whichever rendering of the word <span class= "ital">shethum </span>is adopted. Balaam appears to have been thrown into an ecstatic state, as was Saul, and as were many of the ancient prophets; and whilst the eye of the outer senses was closed, the eye of the inner senses was preternaturally opened.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Balaam... hath said.</span> Rather, "the utterance of Balaam." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5dd;</span> is constantly used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28</a>, for a Divine utterance, <span class="accented">effatum Dei</span>, but it does not by itself, apart from the context, claim a superhuman origin. <span class="cmt_word">The man whose eyes are open.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bb;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>. The authorities are divided between the rendering in the text and the opposite rendering given in the margin. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-8.htm">Lamentations 3:8</a>, in the sense of "shut;" but, on the other hand, a passage in the Mishnah distinctly uses <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> in opposite senses. The Vulgate, on the one hand, has <span class="accented">obturatus</span>; the Septuagint, on the other, has <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and this is the sense given by the Targums. Strange to say, it makes no real difference whether we read "open" or "shut," because in any case it was the inward vision that was quickened, while the outward senses were closed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 Now Balaam spake not his own sense, but the language of the Spirit that came upon him. Many have their eyes open who have not their hearts open; are enlightened, but not sanctified. That knowledge which puffs men up with pride, will but serve to light them to hell, whither many go with their eyes open. The blessing is nearly the same as those given before. He admires in Israel, their beauty. The righteous, doubtless, is more excellent than his neighbour. Their fruitfulness and increase. Their honour and advancement. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their courage and security. The righteous are bold as a lion, not when assaulting others, but when at rest, because God maketh them to dwell in safety. Their influence upon their neighbours. God takes what is done to them, whether good or evil, as done to himself.</body></html>
