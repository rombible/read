Some, however, are of opinion that the journey is the same as that which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-16.htm" title="And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.">Numbers 12:16</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm" title="And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>; and that the arrival at Kadesh was on the first month of the third year, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the year which followed the departure from Sinai, which departure took place on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year after the exodus.<p><span class= "bld">And the people abode in Kadesh.--</span>It is evident that the sojourn in Kadesh was a protracted one, whether Kadesh did, or did not serve as the head-quarters of the people from the second or third year of the exodus until that in which they entered into the land of Canaan. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-46.htm" title="So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you stayed there.">Deuteronomy 1:46</a>, where Moses describes the length of the sojourn in Kadesh by the words "many days," the same words which he employs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-15.htm" title="How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelled in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:">Numbers 20:15</a> to denote the length of the sojourn in the land of Egypt. It cannot, however, be inferred from the simple use of the word which is here rendered <span class= "ital">abode </span>that the sojourn at Kadesh at the beginning of the fortieth year was of long duration (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-17.htm" title="Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray you, pass through your land: but the king of Edom would not listen thereto. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel stayed in Kadesh.">Judges 11:17</a>, where the same word is used). Hence no legitimate conclusion can be drawn from the use of this word respecting the reference of the verse to an arrival at Kadesh at the beginning of the third or of the fortieth year after the exodus. (See 20:14, and Note).<p>THE LAST MARCH: FROM KADESH TO HOR (verses 1-29). Verse 1. - Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation. The latter words are emphatic here and in verse 22, and seem intended to mark the period of reassembly after the dispersion of nearly thirty eight years. Probably a portion of the tribes had visited Kadesh many times during those years, and perhaps it had never been wholly abandoned. <span class="cmt_word">Into the desert of Zin,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, if the western site be maintained for Kadesh, the Wady Murreh.

From comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-38.htm">Numbers 33:38</a> and the sequence of the narrative, it appears to have, been the first month of the fortieth, and last year of wandering, Then it was that they reassembled in the same neighbourhood from whence they had dispersed so long before (see the note before chapter 15). <span class="cmt_word">And the people abode</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Kadesh.</span> From the date given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-38.htm">Numbers 33:38</a> it would seem that they remained three or four months in Kadesh on this occasion. This delay may have been occasioned partly by the ingraining for Miriam (cf. verse 29), and partly by the necessity of awaiting answers from Edom and from Moab (see on verse 14). <span class="cmt_word">And Miriam died there, and was buried.</span> Nothing could be more brief and formal than this mention of the death of one who had played a considerable part in Israel, and had perhaps wished to play a more considerable part. It can scarcely, however, be doubted that her death in the unlovely wilderness was a punishment like the death of her brothers. There is no reason whatever to suppose that she had any part in the rebellion of Kadesh, or that the sentence of death there pronounced included her; she was indeed at this time advanced in years, rut that would not in itself account for the fact that she died in exile; it is, no doubt, to the arrogance and rebellion recorded in chapter 12 that we must look for the true explanation of her untimely end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-13 After thirty-eight years' tedious abode in the wilderness, the armies of Israel advanced towards Canaan again. There was no water for the congregation. We live in a wanting world, and wherever we are, must expect to meet with something to put us out. It is a great mercy to have plenty of water, a mercy which, if we found the want of, we should more own the worth of. Hereupon they murmured against Moses and Aaron. They spake the same absurd and brutish language their fathers had done. It made their crime the worse, that they had smarted so long for the discontent and distrusts of their fathers, yet they venture in the same steps. Moses must again, in God's name, command water out of a rock for them; God is as able as ever to supply his people with what is needful for them. But Moses and Aaron acted wrong. They took much of the glory of this work of wonder to themselves; Must we fetch water? As if it were done by some power or worthiness of their own. They were to speak to the rock, but they smote it. Therefore it is charged upon them, that they did not sanctify God, that is, they did not give to him alone that glory of this miracle which was due unto his name. And being provoked by the people, Moses spake unadvisedly with his lips. The same pride of man would still usurp the office of the appointed Mediator; and become to ourselves wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. Such a state of sinful independence, such a rebellion of the soul against its Saviour, the voice of God condemns in every page of the gospel.</body></html>
