The language of the murmurers is very similar to that which is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-14.htm" title="Moreover you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.">Numbers 16:14</a>, and the word <span class= "ital">gava </span>(die, or expire), which is twice used in this verse, and which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-26.htm" title="And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.">Numbers 16:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-28.htm" title="And Moses said, Hereby you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of my own mind.">Numbers 16:28</a>, in connection with the history of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, is found only in one other place throughout the last four books of the Pentateuch--viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-29.htm" title="And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.">Numbers 20:29</a>. The probability that that plague was of comparatively recent occurrence, and not separated from the present murmuring by a period of nearly forty years, has been inferred from the use of the word <span class= "ital">brethren </span>in this verse. The generation which was contemporary with those who perished in the plague which followed the rebellion of Korah is supposed by some to have been almost extinct at the time to which the events recorded in this chapter are commonly referred, and the word <span class= "ital">fathers, </span>it is alleged, would, in that case, have been more applicable to those who perished than <span class= "ital">brethren. </span>It may be observed, further, that the inquiry, "Wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt?" is more natural when regarded as the language of the generation which had come up out of Egypt as adults, and who looked back to the exodus as to a recent event, than when regarded as that of a generation of which a large number had been born in the wilderness, and the rest had left Egypt nearly forty years previously. These considerations, however, do not appear to be entitled to much weight. The older portion of the congregation, who would naturally be the spokesmen, would speak of those who perished in the insurrection of Korah as their <span class= "ital">brethren, </span>whether the event itself was of recent occurrence or not; and the words which are rendered "Why have ye brought up, &c.?" may, with equal propriety, be rendered "Why did ye bring up, &c.?"(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-16.htm" title="And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and has brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border:">Numbers 20:16</a> and Note).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the people abode with Moses.</span> As their fathers had done in similar circumstances, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Would God that we had died.</span> See on Numbers 14:2. <span class="cmt_word">When our brethren died before the Lord.</span> This is difficult, because the visitations of God at Kibroth-hattaavah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-34.htm">Numbers 11:34</a>) and at Kadesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-37.htm">Numbers 14:37</a>) had overtaken not their brethren, but their fathers, some thirty-eight years before. On the other hand, the daily mortality which had carried off their brethren is clearly excluded by the phrase, "before the Lord." It may he that the rebellion of Korah happened towards <span class="cmt_word">the</span> end of the period of wandering, and that the reference is to the plague which followed it; or it may be that the formula of complaint had become stereotyped, as those of children often do, and was employed from time <span class="cmt_word">to</span> time without variation and without definite reference. The latter supposition is strongly supported by the character of the words which follow. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-13 After thirty-eight years' tedious abode in the wilderness, the armies of Israel advanced towards Canaan again. There was no water for the congregation. We live in a wanting world, and wherever we are, must expect to meet with something to put us out. It is a great mercy to have plenty of water, a mercy which, if we found the want of, we should more own the worth of. Hereupon they murmured against Moses and Aaron. They spake the same absurd and brutish language their fathers had done. It made their crime the worse, that they had smarted so long for the discontent and distrusts of their fathers, yet they venture in the same steps. Moses must again, in God's name, command water out of a rock for them; God is as able as ever to supply his people with what is needful for them. But Moses and Aaron acted wrong. They took much of the glory of this work of wonder to themselves; Must we fetch water? As if it were done by some power or worthiness of their own. They were to speak to the rock, but they smote it. Therefore it is charged upon them, that they did not sanctify God, that is, they did not give to him alone that glory of this miracle which was due unto his name. And being provoked by the people, Moses spake unadvisedly with his lips. The same pride of man would still usurp the office of the appointed Mediator; and become to ourselves wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. Such a state of sinful independence, such a rebellion of the soul against its Saviour, the voice of God condemns in every page of the gospel.</body></html>
