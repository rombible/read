The ambassadors who were sent returned with a denial. The Edomites feared to receive damage by the Israelites. And had this numerous army been under any other discipline than that of the righteous God himself, there might have been cause for this jealousy.

We must not think it strange, if reasonable requests be denied by unreasonable men, and if those whom God favours be affronted by men.</body></html>
