and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.">Numbers 17:10</a>). On the other hand, the natural presumption that the rod was the same as that with which some of the previous miracles in Egypt and those at the Red Sea and at Rephidim had been wrought is confirmed by the facts that the name of Aaron is not mentioned in this verse until after the mention of the rod, and that Moses is said, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm" title="And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.">Numbers 20:11</a>, to have smitten the rock "with his rod."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take the rod.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or staff of office, with which Moses and Aaron had worked wonders before Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-9.htm">Exodus 7:9</a> <span class="accented">sq.</span>), and with which Moses had smitten the rock in Rephidim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>). This rod had not been mentioned, nor perhaps used, since then; but we might certainly have supposed that the instrument of so many miracles would be reverently laid up in the tabernacle "before the Lord," and, this we find from the next verse to have been the case. <span class="cmt_word">Gather</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou the assembly together,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by their representatives. <span class="cmt_word">Speak ye unto the rock before their eyes.</span> The word used for the rock in this narrative is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>. It does not seem that any certain distinction of meaning can be drawn between the words, which are obviously interchanged in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-20.htm">Judges 6:20, 21</a>, and are both translated <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> by the Septuagint; but the careful use of different terms in the two narratives serves to distinguish them, just as the use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> by St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-43.htm">Mark 6:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-8.htm">Mark 8:8, 19, 20</a>) helps to distinguish the two miracles of feeding the multitude. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-13 After thirty-eight years' tedious abode in the wilderness, the armies of Israel advanced towards Canaan again. There was no water for the congregation. We live in a wanting world, and wherever we are, must expect to meet with something to put us out. It is a great mercy to have plenty of water, a mercy which, if we found the want of, we should more own the worth of. Hereupon they murmured against Moses and Aaron. They spake the same absurd and brutish language their fathers had done. It made their crime the worse, that they had smarted so long for the discontent and distrusts of their fathers, yet they venture in the same steps. Moses must again, in God's name, command water out of a rock for them; God is as able as ever to supply his people with what is needful for them. But Moses and Aaron acted wrong. They took much of the glory of this work of wonder to themselves; Must we fetch water? As if it were done by some power or worthiness of their own. They were to speak to the rock, but they smote it. Therefore it is charged upon them, that they did not sanctify God, that is, they did not give to him alone that glory of this miracle which was due unto his name. And being provoked by the people, Moses spake unadvisedly with his lips. The same pride of man would still usurp the office of the appointed Mediator; and become to ourselves wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. Such a state of sinful independence, such a rebellion of the soul against its Saviour, the voice of God condemns in every page of the gospel.</body></html>
