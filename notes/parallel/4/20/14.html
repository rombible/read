It might be inferred frem <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/11-16.htm" title="But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;">Judges 11:16-17</a> that the message to the Kings of Edom and Moab was sent soon after the exodus, and that it was in consequence of their refusal that the sojourn in Kadesh was prolonged: "And (or, So) Israel abode in Kadesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-17.htm" title="Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray you, pass through your land: but the king of Edom would not listen thereto. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel stayed in Kadesh.">Judges 11:17</a>). The account, however, is too summary to admit of any certain inference in regard to time. No difficulty is involved in the fact that Edom is represented in Genesis 36 as being governed by dukes, or chiefs (<span class= "ital">alluphim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>whilst in this place we read of a king. It is possible that the form of government may have been changed, or, as in the case of the rulers of Midian, the same persons who in one place are described as kings may, in another place, be described as dukes, <span class= "ital">duces, </span>or leaders. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm" title="And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.">Numbers 31:8</a>, where the five rulers of Midian are described as <span class= "ital">kings, </span>with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-21.htm" title="And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.">Joshua 13:21</a>, where the same persons are described as <span class= "ital">princes </span>or <span class= "ital">chiefs.</span><p><span class= "bld">Thus saith thy brother Israel.--</span>The Edomites, as the descendants of Esau, who received the name of Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-30.htm" title="And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.">Genesis 25:30</a>), were closely connected with the descendants of Jacob.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom.</span> On the kings of Edom see on Genesis 36:31. It would seem probable from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a> that the government was at that time (forty years before the present date) still in the hands of "dukes," and that the change had but recently taken place. It is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17</a> that Moses sent messengers at this time with a like request to the king of Moab. We are not indeed obliged to suppose that Jephthah, living 300 years after, stated the facts correctly; but there is no particular reason to doubt it in this case. That no mention of it is made here would be sufficiently explained by the fact that the refusal of Edom made the answer of Moab of no practical moment. That Moses asked a passage through the territory of Edom implies that he had renounced the idea of invading Canaan from the south. This was not on account of any insuperable difficulties presented by the character of the country or of its inhabitants, for such did not exist; nor on account of any supposed presence of Egyptian troops in the south of Palestine: but simply on account of the fact that Israel had deliberately refused to take the straight road into their land, and were therefore condemned to follow a long and circuitous route ere they reached it on an altogether different side. The dangers and difficulties of the road they actually traversed were, humanly speaking, far greater than any they would have encountered in any other direction; but this was part of their necessary discipline. <span class="cmt_word">Thy brother Israel.</span> This phrase recalled the history of Esau and Jacob, and of the brotherly kindness which the former had shown to the latter at a time when he had him in his power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33.htm">Genesis 33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">knowest all the travel that hath befallen us.</span> Moses assumed that Edom would take a fraternal interest in the fortunes of Israel. The parallel was singularly close between the position of Jacob when he met with Esau, and the present position of Israel; we may well suppose that Moses intended to make this felt without directly asserting it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:14-21 The nearest way to Canaan from the place where Israel encamped, was through the country of Edom. The ambassadors who were sent returned with a denial. The Edomites feared to receive damage by the Israelites. And had this numerous army been under any other discipline than that of the righteous God himself, there might have been cause for this jealousy. But Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing; and now the hatred revived, when the blessing was about to be inherited. We must not think it strange, if reasonable requests be denied by unreasonable men, and if those whom God favours be affronted by men.</body></html>
