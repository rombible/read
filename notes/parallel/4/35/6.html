It had already been announced in general terms that a place should be appointed whither any one should flee who had unintentionally smitten a man so that he died, and had not lain in wait with a view to commit murder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/21-12.htm" title="He that smites a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.">Exodus 21:12-13</a>). In the verses which follow, the law is delivered at length, and is repeated and further expanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/19-1.htm" title="When the LORD your God has cut off the nations, whose land the LORD your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;">Deuteronomy 19:1-13</a>. There were many reasons why all the cities of refuge were Levitical cities. Of these reasons the chief probably were:--(1) That these cities were specially consecrated to the Lord (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm" title="And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.">Joshua 20:7</a>, "And they appointed," &c.--Heb., <span class= "ital">consecrated</span>)<span class= "ital">; </span>and (2) that it was to the priests and Levites that the people looked as administrators of justice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">among the cities.</span> Rather, "and the cities." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The construction is broken, or rather is continuous throughout verses 6-8, the accusative being repeated. Six <span class="cmt_word">cities</span> for refuge. See below on verse 11. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-8 The cities of the priests and Levites were not only to accommodate them, but to place them, as religious teachers, in several parts of the land. For though the typical service of the tabernacle or temple was only in one place, the preaching of the word of God, and prayer and praise, were not thus confined. These cities were to be given out of each tribe. Each thus made a grateful acknowledgement to God. Each tribe had the benefit of the Levites dwelling amongst them, to teach them the knowledge of the Lord; thus no parts of the country were left to sit in darkness. The gospel provides that he who is taught in the word, should communicate to him that teaches, in all good things, Ga 6:6. We are to free God's ministers from distracting cares, and to leave them at leisure for the duties of their station; so that they may be wholly employed therein, and avail themselves of every opportunity, by acts of kindness, to gain the good-will of the people, and to draw their attention.</body></html>
