This legislation forms the natural sequel and complement of the Divine decrees already promulgated concerning the Levites. Separated from the rest of the tribes from the time of the first census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-49.htm">Numbers 1:49</a>), excluded from any tribal inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>), but endowed with tithes and offerings for their maintenance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>, etc.), it was also necessary that they should be provided with homes for themselves and their cattle. They might indeed have been left to exist as they could, and where they could, upon the provision made for them in the law. But, on the one hand, that provision was itself precarious, depending as it did upon the piety and good feeling of the people (which must often have been found wanting: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8, 9</a>); and, on the other, it is evident that the Levites were intended, as far as their family and social life was concerned, to share the ordinary comforts and enjoyments of Israelites. Nothing could have been more foreign to the Mosaic ideal than a ministry celibate, ascetic, and detached from this world's wealth, such as readily enough sprang up (whether intended or not) under the teaching of the gospel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-4.htm">Luke 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7, 25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-4.htm">2 Timothy 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Suburbs.</span> The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> undoubtedly means here a pasture, or a paddock, an enclosed place outside the town into which the cattle were driven by day to feed. It is possible that the A.V. may have used the word "suburbs" in that sense. To keep cattle to some extent was not only a universal custom, but was well-nigh a necessity of life in that age. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-8 The cities of the priests and Levites were not only to accommodate them, but to place them, as religious teachers, in several parts of the land. For though the typical service of the tabernacle or temple was only in one place, the preaching of the word of God, and prayer and praise, were not thus confined. These cities were to be given out of each tribe. Each thus made a grateful acknowledgement to God. Each tribe had the benefit of the Levites dwelling amongst them, to teach them the knowledge of the Lord; thus no parts of the country were left to sit in darkness. The gospel provides that he who is taught in the word, should communicate to him that teaches, in all good things, Ga 6:6. We are to free God's ministers from distracting cares, and to leave them at leisure for the duties of their station; so that they may be wholly employed therein, and avail themselves of every opportunity, by acts of kindness, to gain the good-will of the people, and to draw their attention.</body></html>
