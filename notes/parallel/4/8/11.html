It may have been done by leading them backwards and forwards in front of the Tabernacle and in the presence of the people, or by the waving of Aaron's hands. The same word is used elsewhere in reference to offerings of different kinds--as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>of gold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-22.htm" title="And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold to the LORD.">Exodus 35:22</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm" title="And you shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering to the LORD.">Numbers 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-15.htm" title="And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them for an offering.">Numbers 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-21.htm" title="And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.">Numbers 8:21</a> of this chapter.) The symbolical meaning of the ceremony is obvious from the concluding words of the verse, and is further explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/8-13.htm" title="And you shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering to the LORD.">Numbers 8:13-14</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm" title="His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.">Leviticus 7:30</a> and Note.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering.</span> Rather, "Aaron shall wave" them "for a wave offering" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">nuph</span>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-24.htm">Exodus 29:24</a>); and so in verses 13, 15, and 21. This injunction seems conclusive that the whole ceremonial was to be symbolically per. formed, for the Levites could not possibly be waved in any literal sense. Some have supposed that they were marched up and down before the altar, forgetting that the court would scarcely afford standing room for 1000 people, while the Levites between thirty and fifty numbered more than 8000. It is certain that the Levites could only be brought before the Lord, could only be waved (howsoever that was done), could only lay their hands upon the bullocks, by representation. If we suppose, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that a hundred men of position and command among them entered the court as representatives of the tribe, then we can understand how the ceremonial here commanded might have been effectively carried out. <span class="cmt_word">That they may execute the service of the Lord.</span> Literally, "that they may be to execute the service of the Lord." Their being waved made them over in a figure to the Lord to be wholly his, and to live only for his service, and at his command. But just as wave offerings were assigned by Divine permission to the use of the priests, so were the Levites given to Aaron and his sons for ever. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-26 Here we have directions for the solemn ordination of the Levites. All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.</body></html>
