The golden candlestick was placed against the south wall of the Tabernacle, opposite to the table of shewbread, so that its seven branches were parallel to that wall, with its branches east and west, and consequently the seven lamps, one of which rested upon each of the seven branches, threw their light in front of the candlestick, i.e., towards the north wall, by which arrangement the furniture of the holy place was more effectually lighted than it would have been had the candlestick been placed facing the entrance, with its branches north and south.<p><span class= "bld">Over against.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">in front of.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou lightest the lamps.</span> The command to light the lamps had been given generally ("they shall light the lamps thereof") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>, and the care of them had been specially confided to Aaron and his sons ("from evening to morning") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>. The actual lighting of the lamps for the first time by Moses is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-25.htm">Exodus 40:25</a>. In the face of these passages it is incredible that the lamps had not been regularly lighted by Aaron for more than a month before the offering of the princes. The seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick. It is somewhat uncertain what this expression, here repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>, means. The Targums give no explanation of it; the Septuagint merely renders verbally, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; the Jewish expositors seem to have thought that the light was to be thrown inward towards the central shaft; most modern commentators, with more probability, understand it to mean that the lamps were to be so placed as to throw their light across the tabernacle towards the north side. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-4 Aaron himself lighted the lamps, thus representing his Divine Master.
