Why, or how, such an admission should discredit the sacred narrative or imperil the truth of its inspiration it would be hard to say. The only thing really likely to imperil the sacred narrative is to persistently deny the obvious literary conclusions which arise from an honest consideration of the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 8:5-26 THE HALLOWING OF THE LEVITES (verses 5-23). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-4 Aaron himself lighted the lamps, thus representing his Divine Master.
