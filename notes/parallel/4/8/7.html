The bullock which was appointed to be offered as a sin-offering at the consecration of Aaron and his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-14.htm" title="But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shall you burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.">Exodus 29:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm" title="And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bullock for the sin offering.">Leviticus 8:14</a>) is described by the same word which is here employed (in the Authorised Version, <span class= "ital">sin-offering</span>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm" title="When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:14</a>, the sacrifice which was appointed to be offered for the expiation of sin (in the Authorised Version, <span class= "ital">the sin</span>) is also spoken of under the same name; so also is the sin-offering of the Levites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-8.htm" title="Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shall you take for a sin offering.">Numbers 8:8</a> of this chapter. The sin-water evidently denotes the water appointed to be used in the purification of sin; and the reference is probably (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-17.htm" title="And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.">Numbers 6:17</a>) to the water which was kept in the brazen laver in front of the Tabernacle. It is possible, however, that some direction which is not here recorded may have been given respecting putting the ashes of the sin-offering into water. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-9.htm" title="And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.">Numbers 19:9</a>, where the water of purification is described under the same name: "it is a purification for sin." Literally, it is <span class= "ital">hattath.</span>) In this case, however, the sin-offering, which is not mentioned until <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-8.htm" title="Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shall you take for a sin offering.">Numbers 8:8</a>, must have been sacrificed previously to the sprinkling.<p><span class= "bld">Let them shave all their flesh.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">cause the razor to pass over all their flesh. </span>A different word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/14-8.htm" title="And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.">Leviticus 14:8-9</a> to denote the more complete removal of the hair which was enjoined at the cleansing of the leper.<p><span class= "bld">And let them wash their clothes.</span>--The bodies of the priests were washed at their consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/14-8.htm" title="And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.">Leviticus 14:8-9</a>), and those of the lepers at their cleansing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm" title="And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.">Leviticus 8:6</a>); but the Levites, who were not brought into such immediate contact with the holy things as the priests, were only required to wash their clothes, which was an ordinary preparation for Divine worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,">Exodus 19:10</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm" title="Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:">Genesis 35:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sprinkle water of purifying upon them.</span> Rather, "water of sin," so called because it had to do with the removal of sin, just as "water of separation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9, 13</a>) was that which delivered from the legal state of separation. It is not likely to have been prepared in the same manner as this latter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9</a>), both because of the great difference between the two cases, and because the ordinance of the red heifer belonged to a later period. Nor is it likely to have resembled that used for cleansing the leper, or the water of jealousy. But it is rash to conclude that, because we do not read any special directions for its preparation, it must, therefore, have been nothing trot water from the laver which stood in the outer court. That water appears, indeed, to be called "holy water" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-17.htm">Numbers 5:17</a>, which is intelligible enough; but no probable reason can be shown why it should be called "sin water;" it would seem as reasonable to call the water which our Lord turned into wine "sill water," because it stood there "for the purifying of the Jews." It is better to say that we do not know, because it is not recorded, how this water was prepared, or how it corresponded to its name. The Levites who were to be sprinkled would seem to have included all the males, some twenty thousand in number; because it was <span class="accented">all</span> the males, and not only those between thirty and fifty, who were to be dedicated in place of the first-born. In any case it was, of course, impossible that Moses could have sprinkled them individually (see below on verse 11). <span class="cmt_word">Let them shave all their flesh.</span> Literally, "let them cause the razor to pass over their whole body." Some distinguish between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> here and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8, 9</a>, as though the latter meant a much more complete shaving off of the hair than the former; but this difference is doubtful; the fact that the whole body as well as the head was to be shaved implies that it was more than a mere cutting short of the hair. <span class="cmt_word">Let them wash their clothes.</span> This was constantly enjoined on all the faithful as a preparation for any special religious service (see on Exodus 19:10). <span class="cmt_word">And so make themselves clean.</span> The shaving and washing had, no doubt, a symbolic significance, but their primary object was simply and obviously personal cleanliness; it is the hair and the clothes that chiefly harbour impurities, especially in a hot climate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:5-26 Here we have directions for the solemn ordination of the Levites. All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.</body></html>
