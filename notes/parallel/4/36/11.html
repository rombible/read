It is evident that the case made a deep impression upon the mind of the nation at the time. <span class="cmt_word">Their</span> <span class="cmt_word">father's brothers' sons.</span> The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> is always translated "father's brother," or "uncle;" and that seems to be its ordinary meaning, although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a> it stands for uncle's son. There is no reason to depart from the customary reading here. No doubt the daughters of Zelophehad acted according to the spirit as well as the letter of the law, and married the nearest male relatives who were open to their choice. The Septuagint <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:5-12 Those who consult the oracles of God, concerning the making of their heavenly inheritance sure, shall not only be directed what to do, but their inquiries shall be graciously accepted. God would not have one tribe enriched at the expense of another. Each tribe was to keep to its own inheritance. The daughters of Zelophehad submitted to this appointment. How could they fail to marry well, when God himself directed them? Let the people of God learn how suitable and proper it is, like the daughters of Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer in Jesus, to be very attentive in the near and tender relations of life, to be united only to such as are united to the Lord? All our intentions and inclinations ought to be subjected to the will of God, when that is made known to us, and especially in contracting marriage. Although the word of God allows affection and preference in this important relation, it does not sanction that foolish, ungovernable, and idolatrous passion, which cares not what may be the end; but in defiance of authority, determines upon self-gratification. All such conduct, however disguised, is against common sense, the interests of society, the happiness of the marriage relation, and, what is still more evil, against the religion of Christ.</body></html>
