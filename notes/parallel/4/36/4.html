At the jubile the transfer of the inheritance to the tribe or tribes into which the daughters of Zelophehad might have married would become permanent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be.</span> It is remarkable that this is the only reference by name to the Jubilee (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, <span class="accented">jubeel</span>; not jubilee, which is the vulgar form of the same word derived from the Latin <span class="accented">jubiheus</span>) to be found in the Scriptures. Some allusions more or less doubtful have been pointed out in the prophets, but the only one which seems incontrovertible is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-17.htm">Ezekiel 46:17</a>, and belongs to the ideal regime of that vision. Jeremiah's right of redemption over the lands of his family was probably due to the fact that they were priestly lands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7-9</a>), and as such incapable of permanent alienation. It is, therefore, doubtful whether the Jubilee was ever actually observed, although the principle upon which it rested, the equity of redemption which no Israelite could divest himself of, was undoubtedly acknowledged (see notes on Leviticus 25). <span class="cmt_word">Then shall their inheritance</span> <span class="cmt_word">be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received.</span> It is again remarkable that the one explicit reference to the Jubilee should be only to an indirect consequence of its practical working. The Jubilee could not really transfer the property of the heiress to her husband's tribe, but it would in effect confirm that transfer, and make it permanent. In practice no property would be considered to have finally changed hands until the year of Jubilee, when an extensive re-settlement took place, and when all titles not successfully challenged would be considered as confirmed. Since the title of the heiress's children could not be challenged, and since any intermediate disposition of the land must then determine, the Jubilee would seem to effect the transfer of which it compelled the recognition. It is, however, none the less strange that the Manassites should have laid such stress upon the practical effects of a piece of legislation which had never yet come into use. It seems to point to the conclusion that the same thing had been customary among them in their Egyptian homes, and that they were acquainted, at least by tradition, with its actual working. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-4 The heads of the tribe of Manasseh represent the evil which might follow, if the daughters of Zelophehad should marry into any other tribes. They sought to preserve the Divine appointment of inheritances, and that contests and quarrels should not rise among those who should come afterwards. It is the wisdom and duty of those who have estates in the world, to settle them, and to dispose of them, so that no strife and contention may arise.</body></html>
