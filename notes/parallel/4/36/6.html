The direction is not altogether plain, since the <span class="accented">tribe</span> (<span class="accented">matteh</span>) contained several families (<span class="accented">mishpachoth</span>), and in this case one or more of the families were widely separated from the rest. Probably the words are to be read, "only to the tribe-family of their father," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, only into that <span class="accented">mishpachah</span> of Manasseh to which their father had belonged. Practically, therefore, they were restricted to the family of the Hepherites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-32.htm">Numbers 26:32, 33</a>). This is made almost certain when we remember that the territory of the "family" was to be apportioned within the tribe in the same way, and with the same regard to relationship, as the territory of the tribe within the nation (see on Numbers 33:54). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:5-12 Those who consult the oracles of God, concerning the making of their heavenly inheritance sure, shall not only be directed what to do, but their inquiries shall be graciously accepted. God would not have one tribe enriched at the expense of another. Each tribe was to keep to its own inheritance. The daughters of Zelophehad submitted to this appointment. How could they fail to marry well, when God himself directed them? Let the people of God learn how suitable and proper it is, like the daughters of Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer in Jesus, to be very attentive in the near and tender relations of life, to be united only to such as are united to the Lord? All our intentions and inclinations ought to be subjected to the will of God, when that is made known to us, and especially in contracting marriage. Although the word of God allows affection and preference in this important relation, it does not sanction that foolish, ungovernable, and idolatrous passion, which cares not what may be the end; but in defiance of authority, determines upon self-gratification. All such conduct, however disguised, is against common sense, the interests of society, the happiness of the marriage relation, and, what is still more evil, against the religion of Christ.</body></html>
