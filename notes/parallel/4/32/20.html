It may be inferred from this expression that the army of the Israelites was regarded as the army of the Lord; and it seems probable that there is a reference to the ark of the Lord as being carried on certain occasions into the war. If the order of march prescribed in the second chapter of this Book was still observed, there may be a reference to the fact that the tribes of Reuben and Gad, which encamped on the south side of the Tabernacle, immediately preceded the ark (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/10-18.htm" title="And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.">Numbers 10:18-22</a>), just as those of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh immediately followed it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-2.htm" title="Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up your strength, and come and save us.">Psalm 80:2</a>). At the time of the passage of the Jordan, the priests who bare the ark stood still in the river until the whole of the people had passed over "before the ark of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-5.htm" title="And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:">Joshua 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.">Joshua 4:11</a>); but at the siege of Jericho it appears that the ark was carried in the midst of the host, some of the armed men going before it, and some following after it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-9.htm" title="And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.">Joshua 6:9</a>). If this is the true meaning of the word "before the Lord," it was natural that the Reubenites, or their spokesman, should first use the words "before the children of Israel" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm" title="But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.">Numbers 32:17</a>, and should not adopt the expression "before the Lord," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-32.htm" title="We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.">Numbers 32:32</a>, until it had been previously employed by Moses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the Lord.</span> Perhaps in a quasi-local sense, as the vanguard of the host before the sacred symbols of the Lord's presence (see on chapter Numbers 10:21, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-9.htm">Joshua 6:9</a>). But since the same expression (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is twice used in a much vaguer sense in verse 22, it is more probable that it only means "in the Lord's service, or "beneath his eye." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:16-27 Here is the good effect of plain dealing. Moses, by showing their sin, and the danger of it, brought them to their duty, without murmuring or disputing. All men ought to consider the interests of others as well as their own; the law of love requires us to labour, venture, or suffer for each other as there may be occasion. They propose that their men of war should go ready armed before the children of Israel into the land of Canaan, and that they should not return till the conquest of Canaan was ended. Moses grants their request, but he warns them of the danger of breaking their word. If you fail, you sin against the Lord, and not against your brethren only; God will certainly reckon with you for it. Be sure your sin will find you out. Sin will surely find out the sinner sooner or later. It concerns us now to find our sins out, that we may repent of them, and forsake them, lest they find us out to our ruin.</body></html>
