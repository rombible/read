It is true that the meaning of the word in the first clause is defined by the addition of the word which is rendered "or forward," and which is more correctly rendered <span class= "ital">and forward</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"further off," or "to a greater distance; "and that its meaning in the second clause is defined by the addition of the word "eastward," or "towards the sun-rising;" but the application of the same word to the country on both sides of the Jordan shows that it cannot be inferred, with any degree of certainty, from the use of this word, whether the position of the writer was on the eastern or western side of the river. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-32.htm" title="We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.">Numbers 32:32</a>, where the same word occurs without any addition.) The language of the Gadites and the Reubenites must not be interpreted as if it were spoken in a defiant spirit, but as disclaiming their right to any portion of the inheritance on the west of the Jordan if they obtained their request to settle on the eastern side.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On yonder side Jordan.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>.

They do not seem to have received any Divine intimation that their lot was to be on the east of Jordan, but rather to have been guided by their own preference. If so, they cannot be acquitted of a certain presumptuous willfulness in action, and of a certain want of honesty in speech. The phrase here rendered "on this side Jordan" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d6;</span>) cannot be distinguished grammatically from that which bears an opposite signification in the preceding verse. In itself it is perfectly ambiguous without some qualifying word or phrase, and it is very difficult to know what the ordinary use of it was in the time of Moses. In later ages, no doubt, it came to mean simply the trans-Jordanic territory, or Peraea, without reference to the position of the speaker. The difficulty here is to decide whether the expression, as further defined by "eastward," would actually have been used at that time and in that place, or whether the expression is due to a writer living on the west of Jordan. All we can say is, that the awkward use of the phrase in two opposite meanings, with words of clearer definition added, points more or less strongly towards a probability that the passage as it stands was written or revised at a later date. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:16-27 Here is the good effect of plain dealing. Moses, by showing their sin, and the danger of it, brought them to their duty, without murmuring or disputing. All men ought to consider the interests of others as well as their own; the law of love requires us to labour, venture, or suffer for each other as there may be occasion. They propose that their men of war should go ready armed before the children of Israel into the land of Canaan, and that they should not return till the conquest of Canaan was ended. Moses grants their request, but he warns them of the danger of breaking their word. If you fail, you sin against the Lord, and not against your brethren only; God will certainly reckon with you for it. Be sure your sin will find you out. Sin will surely find out the sinner sooner or later. It concerns us now to find our sins out, that we may repent of them, and forsake them, lest they find us out to our ruin.</body></html>
