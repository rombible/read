The "land of Jazer" would seem to mean the Mishor, or plateau, of Heshbon, over which the Israelites had passed on their way to the plains of Moab (see on Deuteronomy 3:10, "all the cities of the Mishor"). <span class="cmt_word">The land of Gilead.</span> Gilead as the name of a district only previously occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>. It is used with a considerable latitude of meaning in this and the following books. In its widest sense it stands for the whole territory to the east of Jordan (see on verses 26, 29), including even the rugged, volcanic districts of Bashan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>); but more properly it denoted the lands on both sides the Jabbok, from the Wady Hesban on the south, to the Yermuk and lake of Tiberias on the north, now known as the provinces of Belka and Jebel Ajlun. These lands are by no means uniformly flat, as the name "Mount Gilead" testifies, but include mountains and hills covered with fine open forests of oak (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-8.htm">2 Samuel 18:8, 9</a>) as well as rolling downs and treeless plains. The soil is almost everywhere of great fertility, and the water supply, although very scanty in summer, is sufficient if carefully husbanded. Even now these provinces produce great store of grain, and are depastured by vast flocks of sheep. In Roman times, as the innumerable ruins testify, they were filled with a large and opulent population. Indeed there could be no comparison in point of agricultural and pastoral value between these open and fertile lands and the broken, stony country of Southern Palestine. If they ever enjoy again the blessing of a strong government and continuous peace they will again justify the choice of Reuben and Gad. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">place for cattle.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used here in the broader sense of district (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>), and is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> in verse 4. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:1-5 Here is a proposal made by the Reubenites and Gadites, that the land lately conquered might be allotted to them. Two things common in the world might lead these tribes to make this choice; the lust of the eye, and the pride of life. There was much amiss in the principle they went upon; they consulted their own private convenience more than the public good. Thus to the present time, many seek their own things more than the things of Jesus Christ; and are led by worldly interests and advantages to take up short of the heavenly Canaan.</body></html>
