It is not probable that new cities would have been built at this time, nor did the circumstances of the Israelites admit of the delay which would have been involved in such an undertaking. It was at Dibon that the Moabite stone was discovered by Mr. Klein in 1868. For the geographical position and modern names of the towns mentioned in these verses, see Keil (<span class= "ital">in loc</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>In the distribution of the towns by Joshua, some of the southernmost towns repaired or fortified by the Gadites appear to have fallen to the tribe of Reuben.

Dibon. Now Dhiban, four miles north of Arnon. It is called Dibon-gad in chapter Numbers 33:45, 46, but it is doubtful whether there is any allusion to its present occupation, since "Gad" was a common affix in the languages of Canaan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>). Dibon was subsequently assigned to Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>), but was recovered by Moab, and became one of his strongholds (of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18, 22</a>) The Moabite stone was found here. <span class="cmt_word">Ataroth.</span> Now Attarus, seven miles from Dibon. <span class="cmt_word">Aroer.</span> Not the Aroer before Rabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), but the Aroer by the brink of Arnon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:28-42 Concerning the settlement of these tribes, observe, that they built the cities, that is, repaired them. They changed the names of them; probably they were idolatrous, therefore they should be forgotten. A spirit of selfishness, of seeking our own, not the things of Christ, when each one ought to assist others, is as dangerous as it is common. It is impossible to be sincere in the faith, sensible of the goodness of God, constrained by the love of Christ, sanctified by the power of the Holy Ghost, and yet be indifferent to the progress of religion, and the spiritual success of others, through love of ease, or fear of conflict. Let then your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</body></html>
