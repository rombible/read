Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!">Numbers 23:10</a>). Few of the ancient prophecies are more remarkable, as Bishop Wordsworth has observed, than those of Balaam for "spirituality of conception and sublimity of expression." And if, as some think, we are to understand <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm" title="He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?">Micah 6:8</a> as containing the actual words which were addressed by Balaam to Balak, few men possessed a clearer perception of moral truth than that which is expressed in the words, "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? "And yet, notwithstanding the light which Balaam possessed, the sublimity of the prophecies which he uttered, and the purity of the motives by which he professed to be actuated, he "loved the wages of unrighteousness," and gave himself up to do Satan's bidding in "casting a stumbling-block before the children of Israel," and miserably perished amongst the enemies of God and of His people. Bishop Wordsworth draws a striking and instructive contrast between Balaam and Moses, both of whom had visions of Christ and prophesied of Him, whilst one loved the wages of unrighteousness, and the other did all for God's glory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain.</span> This is more accurately rendered by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: "they put to death (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span>) the kings, in addition to those who fell in battle" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, to pierce, or wound). These five kings, who are mentioned here as having been slain in cold blood after the battle, are said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-21.htm">Joshua 13:21</a> to have been vassals (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) of the Amoritish king Sihon, and to have dwelt "in the country." From this it has been concluded by some that the Midianites at this time destroyed included only certain tribes which had settled down within the territory afterwards assigned to Reuben, and had become tributary to Sihon. This would account for the fact that the present victory was so easy and so complete, and also for the otherwise inexplicable fact that the Midianites appear again as a formidable power some two centuries later.

Had he himself rightly believed what he had said of the happy state of Israel, he would not have thus herded with the enemies of Israel. The Midianites' wicked wiles were Balaam's projects: it was just that he should perish with them, Ho 4:5. They took the women and children captives.
