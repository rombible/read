The reference may be only to the silver trumpets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-9.htm" title="And if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you, then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and you shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.">Numbers 10:9</a>), or it may include other sacred instruments. This was emphatically a holy war; and we may learn, from the command given to the Israelites to take with them "the holy instruments," that they who would engage in the war against sin and Satan must "take to them the whole armour of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Phinehas the son of Eleazar.</span> The high priest himself could not leave the camp and the sanctuary, because of his duties, and because of the risk of being defiled (see verse 19); but his son, who was already marked out as his successor, could act as his representative (see on Numbers 16:37). In after times the Messiah Milchama ("Sacerdos unctus ad bellum," alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-2.htm">Deuteronomy 20:2</a>) who accompanied the army to the field was a recognized member of the Jewish hierarchy. Phinehas was of course specially marked out by his zeal for the present duty, but we may suppose that he would have gone in any case. <span class="cmt_word">With the holy instruments, and the trumpets.</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. The word instruments (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) is the same more usually translated "vessel," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-31.htm">Numbers 3:31</a>, and is apparently to be understood of the sacred furniture of the tabernacle. It is difficult to understand what "holy vessels" could have accompanied an expedition of this sort, unless it were the ark itself. The Israelites were accustomed at all critical times to be preceded by the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-8.htm">Joshua 6:8</a>), and the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a> sq. shows plainly that, long after the settlement at Shiloh, no scruples existed against bringing it forth against the foes of Israel and of God. Indeed there is a resemblance in the circumstances between that ease and this which is all the more striking because of the contrast in the result. Most modern commentators, unwilling to believe that the ark left the camp (but cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>), identify the "holy instruments" with "the trumpets;" this, however, is plainly to do violence to the grammar, which is perfectly simple, and is contrary to the Septuagint and the Targums. The Targum of Palestine paraphrases "holy instruments" by Urim and Thummim; these, however, as far as we can gather, seem to have been in the exclusive possession of the high priest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/31.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>31:1-6 All who, without commission from God, dare to execute private revenge, and who, from ambition, covetousness, or resentment, wage war and desolate kingdoms, must one day answer for it. But if God, instead of sending an earthquake, a pestilence, or a famine, be pleased to authorize and command any people to avenge his cause, such a commission surely is just and right. The Israelites could show such a commission, though no persons now can do so. Their wars were begun and carried on expressly by Divine direction, and they were enabled to conquer by miracles. Unless it can be proved that the wicked Canaanites did not deserve their doom, objectors only prove their dislike to God, and their love to his enemies. Man makes light of the evil of sin, but God abhors it. This explains the terrible executions of the nations which had filled the measure of their sins.</body></html>
