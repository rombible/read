(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-9.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.">Exodus 33:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-5.htm" title="And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.">Numbers 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-15.htm" title="And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.">Deuteronomy 31:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I will take of the spirit which is upon thee . . . --</span>These words do not imply that there was any diminution of the gifts bestowed upon Moses, but that a portion of those spiritual gifts was bestowed upon the seventy. Rashi compares the mode of bestowal with the manner in which the other lamps of the Sanctuary were lighted at the golden candlestick without diminishing the light from which theirs was taken.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">take of the spirit which</span> is <span class="cmt_word">upon thee, and will put it upon them.</span> The Holy Spirit is one and indivisible. But in the language of Scripture "the Spirit" often stands for the <span class="accented">charismata</span>, or gifts of the Spirit, and in this sense is freely spoken of as belonging to this or that man. So the "spirit of Elijah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9, 15</a>), which was transferred to Elisha, as it were, by bequest. It was <span class="accented">not</span>, therefore, the personal indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost in Moses which God caused him to share with the seventy elders, for that can in no ease be a matter of transfer or of arrangement, but simply those <span class="accented">charismata</span> or extraordinary gifts of the Spirit which Moses had hitherto enjoyed alone as the prophet of Israel. It is strange that in the face of the clear teaching of St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12, 13</a>, and in view of such cases as those of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>; 19:93) and David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), any difficulty should have been felt about this passage. <span class="cmt_word">They shall bear the burden of the people with thee.</span> It does not appear how they were to do this, nor is there any record of their work. Their gifts, however, were spiritual, and we may probably assume that their usefulness lay in producing and maintaining a proper religious tone among the people. The real difficulty which stood in the way of Moses was not one of outward organization or of government, for that had been amply provided for; it lay in the bad tone which prevailed among the people, and threatened to destroy at any moment the very foundations of their national hope and safety. We may see in these seventy not indeed a Sanhedrim to exercise authority and discipline, but the first commencement of that prophetic order which afterwards played so large a part in the religious history of Israel and of the early Christian Church - an order designed kern the first to supplement by the freedom and originality of their ministry the more formal and unvarying offices of the priesthood. If this was the nature of their usefulness, it is not surprising that they are never mentioned again; and it is observable that a similar obscurity hangs over the activity of the prophets of the New Testament, who yet formed a most important part of the gospel <span class="accented">regime</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:16-23 Moses is to choose such as he knew to be elders, that is, wise and experienced men. God promises to qualify them. If they were not found fit for the employ, they should be made fit. Even the discontented people shall be gratified too, that every mouth may be stopped. See here, I. The vanity of all the delights of sense; they will cloy, but they will not satisfy. Spiritual pleasures alone will satisfy and last. As the world passes away, so do the lusts of it. 2. What brutish sins gluttony and drunkenness are! they make that to hurt the body which should be its health. Moses objects. Even true and great believers sometimes find it hard to trust God under the discouragements of second causes, and against hope to believe in hope. God here brings Moses to this point, The Lord God is Almighty; and puts the proof upon the issue, Thou shalt see whether my word shall come to pass or not. If he speaks, it is done.</body></html>
