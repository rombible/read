The dissatisfaction of the Israelites with the sweet bread of heaven, and their craving after the more savoury and more stimulating food of Egypt may be regarded as typical of man's natural repugnance to the spiritual food which is provided in the Gospel, and his restless cravings after the pleasures of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The manna was as coriander seed.</span> On the name and the nature of the manna see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>. It is commonly supposed that the brief description here inserted was intended to show the unreasonableness of the popular complaints. There is no trace whatever of any such purpose. So far as the description conveys fresh information, it was simply suggested by the occurrence of the word "manna," according to the artless style of the narrative. If any moral purpose must be assigned to this digression, it would rather be to suggest that the people had some real temptation to complain. It is often forgotten that, although the manna was supernatural, at least as to the amount and regularity of its supply, yet as an article of food it contained no supernatural elements. If we had to live upon nothing but cakes flavored with honey or with olive oil, it is certain that we should soon find them pall upon our appetite. To the eye of the Psalmist the manna appeared as angels' food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>); but then the Psalmist had not lived on manna every day for a year. We have to remember, in this as in many other cases, that the Israelites would not be "our ensamples" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>) if they had not succumbed to real temptations. As the colour of bdellium. See on Genesis 2:12. As no one knows anything at all about bdellium, this adds nothing to our knowledge of the manna. The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "the appearance of ice," or perhaps "of hoar-frost." As it translates bdellium in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a> by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> (carbuncle), it is probable that the comparison to ice here is due to some tradition about the manna. Taking this passage in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>, we may reasonably conjecture that it was of an opalescent white, the same colour probably which is mentioned in connection with manna in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:4-9 Man, having forsaken his proper rest, feels uneasy and wretched, though prosperous. They were weary of the provision God had made for them, although wholesome food and nourishing. It cost no money or care, and the labour of gathering it was very little indeed; yet they talked of Egypt's cheapness, and the fish they ate there freely; as if that cost them nothing, when they paid dearly for it with hard service! While they lived on manna, they seemed exempt from the curse sin has brought on man, that in the sweat of his face he should eat bread; yet they speak of it with scorn. Peevish, discontented minds will find fault with that which has no fault in it, but that it is too good for them. Those who might be happy, often make themselves miserable by discontent. They could not be satisfied unless they had flesh to eat. It is evidence of the dominion of the carnal mind, when we want to have the delights and satisfaction of sense. We should not indulge in any desire which we cannot in faith turn into prayer, as we cannot when we ask meat for our lust. What is lawful of itself becomes evil, when God does not allot it to us, yet we desire it.</body></html>
