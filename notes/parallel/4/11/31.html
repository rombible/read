A south-east wind would bring the quails from the neighbourhood of the Red Sea, where they abound.<p><span class= "bld">And let them fall.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and scattered them </span>(or, <span class= "ital">spread them out</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-16.htm" title="And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad on all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.">1Samuel 30:16</a> : "They were spread abroad upon all the earth," or, over all the ground.<p><span class= "bld">Round about.--</span>See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-24.htm" title="And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.">Numbers 11:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">about two cubits over </span>(or, <span class= "ital">above</span>)<span class= "ital"> the ground. </span>Had the quails lain upon the earth in a heap for any considerable time, life could only have been preserved by miraculous interference with the ordinary laws of nature, and the Israelites were not allowed to eat of that which had died of itself. Quails commonly fly low, and when wearied with a long flight might fly only about breast-high. On the other hand, the more obvious interpretation of the words is that the quails were spread over the ground, and covered it in some places to the height of two cubits. They were probably taken and killed immediately on their descent, as the following verse seems to indicate, and then spread out and dried and hardened in the sun. Some think that the word which is here rendered <span class= "ital">quails </span>denotes <span class= "ital">cranes.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wind from the Lord.</span> A wind Divinely sent for this purpose. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-26.htm">Psalm 78:26</a> it is said to have been a wind from the east and south, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a wind blowing up the Red Sea and across the Gulf of <span class="cmt_word">Akabah. And brought quails from the sea.</span> On the "quails" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">salvim</span> - probably the common quail) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a>. The Septuagint has in both places <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, "the quail-mother," the sense of which is uncertain. These birds, which migrate in spring in vast numbers, came from the sea, but it does not follow that the camp was near the sea. They may have been following up the Gulf of Akabah, and been swept far inland by the violence of the gale. <span class="cmt_word">Let them fall</span> <span class="cmt_word">by the camp.</span> Rather, "threw them down on the camp." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. Either the sudden cessation of the gale, or a violent eddying of the wind, threw the exhausted birds in myriads upon the camp (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Two cubits high upon the face of the</span> earth. The word "high" is not in the original, but it probably gives the true meaning. The Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, is somewhat uncertain. The Targums assert that the quails "flew upon the face of the ground, at a height of two cubits;" and this is followed by the Vulgate ("<span class="accented">volabant in acre duobus cubitis altiludine super terram"</span>) and by many commentators. This idea, however, although suggested by the actual habits of the bird, and adopted in order to avoid the obvious difficulty of the statement, is inconsistent with the expressions used here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>. If the birds were "thrown" upon the camp, or "rained" upon it like sand, they could not have been flying steadily forward a few feet above the ground. It is certainly impossible to take the statement literally, for such a mass of birds would have been perfectly unmanageable; but if we suppose that they were drifted by the wind into heaps, which in places reached the height of two cubits, that will satisfy the exigencies of the text: anything like a uniform depth would be the last thing to be expected under the circumstances. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:31-35 God performed his promise to the people, in giving them flesh. How much more diligent men are in collecting the meat that perishes, than in labouring for meat which endures to everlasting life! We are quick-sighted in the affairs of time; but stupidity blinds us as to the concerns of eternity. To pursue worldly advantages, we need no arguments; but when we are to secure the true riches, then we are all forgetfulness. Those who are under the power of a carnal mind, will have their lusts fulfilled, though it be to the certain damage and ruin of their precious souls. They paid dearly for their feasts. God often grants the desires of sinners in wrath, while he denies the desires of his own people in love. What we unduly desire, if we obtain it, we have reason to fear, will be some way or other a grief and cross to us. And what multitudes there are in all places, who shorten their lives by excess of one kind or other! Let us seek for those pleasures which satisfy, but never surfeit; and which will endure for evermore.</body></html>
