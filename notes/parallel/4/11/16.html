but the fault is in your own people.">Exodus 5:16</a>;<p>also of seventy elders in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a>. Frequent mention is made in Scripture of the number <span class= "ital">seventy--</span>a number which is composed of the two sacred numbers <span class= "ital">seven </span>and <span class= "ital">ten</span>--the former being the seal of the covenant, and the latter probably denoting perfection. The seventy who were chosen on the present occasion may have consisted of some of those who were appointed as judges at the suggestion of Jethro, but there is no evidence of their identity with any persons previously selected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Moses.</span> The Divine dignity and goodness of this answer, if not an absolutely conclusive testimony, are at least a very strong one, to the genuineness of this record. Of what god, except the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, was it ever witnessed, or could it have been ever imagined, that he should answer the passionate injustice of his servant with such forbearance and kindness? The one thing in Moses' prayer which was reasonable he allowed at once; the rest he passed over without answer or reproof, as though it had never been uttered. <span class="cmt_word">Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel.</span> That the number seventy has a symbolic significance in Scripture will hardly be denied (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>), although it is probably futile to affix any precise meaning to it. Perhaps the leading idea of seventy is fullness, as that of twelve is symmetry (see on Exodus 15:27). The later Jews believed that there were seventy nations in the world. There is no reason, except a reckless desire to confound the sacred narrative, to identify this appointment with that narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> The circumstances and the purposes appear quite distinct: those were appointed to assist Moses in purely secular matters, to share his burden as a judge; these to assist him in religious matters, to support him as a mediator; those used the ordinary gifts of wisdom, discretion, and personal authority; these the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. It is more reasonable to suppose that these seventy were the same men that went up into Mount Sinai with Moses, and saw the God of Israel, and ate of the consecrated meal of the covenant, about a year before. Unless there was some decisive reason against it, an elder who had been chosen for that high religious privilege could hardly fail to be chosen on this occasion also; an interview with God himself, so mysteriously and awfully significant, must surely have left an ineffaceable stamp of sanctity on any soul at all worthy of it. It would be natural to suppose that while the present selection was made <span class="accented">de novo</span>, the individuals selected were personally the same. Compare note on chapter Numbers 1:5, and for "the elders of Israel" see on Exodus 3:16. <span class="cmt_word">Whom thou knowest to be elders of the people, and officers over them.</span> On the officers (Hebrew, <span class="accented">shoterim</span>), an ancient order in the national organization of Israel, continued from the days of bondage, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>. The Targ. Pal. paraphrases the word <span class="accented">shoterim</span> by "who were set over them in Mizraim." The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, words so familiar to the reader of the Greek Gospels. The later Jews traced back their Sanhedrim, or grand council of seventy, to this appointment, and found their eiders and scribes in this verse. There was, however, no further historical connection between the two bodies than this - that when the monarchy failed and prophecy died out, the ecclesiastical leaders of the Jews modeled their institutions upon, and adapted their titles <span class="accented">to</span>, this Divinely-ordered original. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:16-23 Moses is to choose such as he knew to be elders, that is, wise and experienced men. God promises to qualify them. If they were not found fit for the employ, they should be made fit. Even the discontented people shall be gratified too, that every mouth may be stopped. See here, I. The vanity of all the delights of sense; they will cloy, but they will not satisfy. Spiritual pleasures alone will satisfy and last. As the world passes away, so do the lusts of it. 2. What brutish sins gluttony and drunkenness are! they make that to hurt the body which should be its health. Moses objects. Even true and great believers sometimes find it hard to trust God under the discouragements of second causes, and against hope to believe in hope. God here brings Moses to this point, The Lord God is Almighty; and puts the proof upon the issue, Thou shalt see whether my word shall come to pass or not. If he speaks, it is done.</body></html>
