The cucumbers in Egypt are of great size and finely flavoured. The watermelons serve to moderate the internal heat which the climate produces. (See <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book, </span>p. 508.) The word rendered <span class= "ital">leeks </span>(in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm" title="He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;">Psalm 104:14</a>, <span class= "ital">grass </span>for cattle) is supposed by some to denote a species of clover which is peculiar to Egypt, and of which the young and fresh shoots are said to be used as food and to be an excellent stomachic. The onions of Egypt are said to be the sweetest in the world, and they constitute the common food of the lowest class of the people. Garlic is still much used by the modern Arabs. It is only the fish, which was probably equally within the reach of all, of which the Israelites are said to have eaten <span class= "ital">freely, i.e., </span>not <span class= "ital">abundantly, </span>but <span class= "ital">gratuitously. </span>It is probable, however, that many of them cultivated the land to a greater or lesser degree, and so procured vegetables for themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.,<span class="cmt_word"></span></span> gratis. No doubt this was an exaggeration on the part of the murmurers, but it is attested by classical writers that fish swarmed in the Nile waters, and cost next to nothing (Died. Sic., 1:36, 52; Herod., 2:93; Strabo, 17. page 829). <span class="cmt_word">Cucumbers.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bb;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Cucumbers of peculiar softness and flavour are spoken of by Egyptian travelers as <span class="accented">fructus in Egypto omnium vulgatissimus. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Melons.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Water-melons, still called <span class="accented">battieh</span>, grow in Egypt, as in all hot, moist lands, like weeds, and are as much the luxury of the poorest as of the richest. <span class="cmt_word">Leeks.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>. This word usually means grass (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>), and may do so hare, for the modern Egyptians eat a kind of field-clover freely. The Septuagint, however, translates it by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, leeks or chives, which agrees better with the context. Pliny (Nat. Hist. 19:33) speaks of it as "<span class="accented">laudatissimus porrus in Egypto." <span class="cmt_word"></span>Onions.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Garlic.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. These are mentioned in the well-known passage of Herodotus (2:125) as forming the staple food of the workmen at the pyramids; these still form a large part of the diet of the labouring classes in Egypt, as in other Mediterranean countries. If we look at these different articles of food together, so naturally and inartificially mentioned in this verse, we find a strong argument for the genuineness of the narrative. They are exactly the luxuries which an Egyptian labourer of that day would have cried out for, if deprived of them; they are <span class="accented">not</span> the luxuries which a Jew of Palestine would covet, or would even think cf. The very words here used for the cucumber, the melon, and the garlic were probably Egyptian, for they may still be recognized in the common names of those vegetables in Egypt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:4-9 Man, having forsaken his proper rest, feels uneasy and wretched, though prosperous. They were weary of the provision God had made for them, although wholesome food and nourishing. It cost no money or care, and the labour of gathering it was very little indeed; yet they talked of Egypt's cheapness, and the fish they ate there freely; as if that cost them nothing, when they paid dearly for it with hard service! While they lived on manna, they seemed exempt from the curse sin has brought on man, that in the sweat of his face he should eat bread; yet they speak of it with scorn. Peevish, discontented minds will find fault with that which has no fault in it, but that it is too good for them. Those who might be happy, often make themselves miserable by discontent. They could not be satisfied unless they had flesh to eat. It is evidence of the dominion of the carnal mind, when we want to have the delights and satisfaction of sense. We should not indulge in any desire which we cannot in faith turn into prayer, as we cannot when we ask meat for our lust. What is lawful of itself becomes evil, when God does not allot it to us, yet we desire it.</body></html>
