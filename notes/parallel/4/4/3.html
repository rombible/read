The present census was with a view to the discharge of duties requiring a considerable amount of physical strength, and hence the prescribed age for entering upon these duties was fixed at this time at thirty, and limited to fifty. It has been supposed by some that five years were spent in preparation for the service, and that it is in this way that the apparent discrepancy between this verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm" title="This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 8:24</a>, where the age for entering upon the service is fixed at twenty-five, is to be reconciled. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm" title="This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 8:24</a>.) In Eastern countries the strength fails at an earlier period than in colder and more temperate climates. Thirty was the age at which John the Baptist and our Lord entered upon their public ministry.<p><span class= "bld">All that enter into the host.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">every one who enters upon the service. </span>The word <span class= "ital">zaba, </span>commonly rendered <span class= "ital">host, </span>and used elsewhere to denote military service, is here used to denote the service of the sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From thirty years old and upward.</span> The age at which they became liable for service was shortly after reduced to twenty-five (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>), and at a later period to twenty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-27.htm">1 Chronicles 23:27</a>). In the wilderness a larger number of the men might be required to attend to their own camps, and their own families; but the explanation may probably be found in the unusually large proportion who were at this time between the ages of thirty and fifty. The Septuagint has altered thirty into twenty-five to make it agree with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>. Thirty years became among the Jews the perfect age at which a man attained to full maturity, and entered upon all his fights and duties (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into the host.</span> Not the military ranks, but the <span class="accented">militia sacra</span> of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">To do the work.</span> Literally, "to war the warfare." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-3 The middle-aged men of the tribe of Levi, all from thirty years old to fifty, were to be employed in the service of the tabernacle. The service of God requires the best of our strength, and the prime portion of our time, which cannot be better spent than to the honour of Him who is the First and Best. And the service of God should be done when we are most lively and active. Those do not consider this who put off repentance to old age, and so leave the best work to be done in the worst time.</body></html>
