The LXX. and the Samaritan text supply a statement respecting the covering and conveyance of the brazen laver. The clause in the LXX. is as follows :--"And they shall take a purple cloth, and cover the laver and its foot (or base), and they shall put it into a blue cover of skin, and put it on bars." There is no sufficient ground. however, for supposing that the present Hebrew text is deficient in this place; and it seems more probable to suppose that the laver was not to be covered during its transport.<p><span class= "bld">After that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to bear, or carry</span>--viz., the whole of the vessels of ministry which had been previously enumerated. The distinction between the service of the priests and that of the Levites in regard to the removal of the Tabernacle and its furniture is here clearly marked.<p><span class= "bld">But they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die.</span>--The word which is rendered "any holy thing" may here, as elsewhere, denote <span class= "ital">the sanctuary. </span>This injunction is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-3.htm" title="And they shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor you also, die.">Numbers 18:3</a>. We find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/6-6.htm" title="And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.">2Samuel 6:6-7</a> an instance of the fatal result of the violation of this command by Uzzah, who being, as is most probable, a Levite, and of the family of Kohath, ought to have been acquainted with the law respecting the removal of the Ark. It is obvious that the Kohathites, as the immediate assistants of the priests, in regard to the vessels of the Sanctuary, were specially exposed to the risk of violating the law by touching the most holy things.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath.</span> One thing which the Kohathites almost certainly had to carry is omitted here, possibly because it was carried without any cover at all, and was not regarded as of equal sanctity with the rest. Anyhow, the omission is very remarkable, and may have been accidental. It is supplied by the Septuagint and the Samaritan text in the following addition to verse 14: "And they shall take a purple cloth, and cover the laver and its foot, and they shall put it into a hyacinthine cover of skin, and put it on bars." The burdens of the Kohathites were six, not counting the laver and its foot: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the ark; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the table of shewbread; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the candelabrum; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the golden altar; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> "instruments of ministry;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the frame of the brazen altar. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:4-20 The Kohathites were to carry the holy things of the tabernacle. All the holy things were to be covered; not only for security and respect, but to keep them from being seen. This not only marked the reverence due to holy things, but the mystery of the things signified by those types, and the darkness of the dispensation. But now, through Christ, the case is altered, and we are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace.</body></html>
