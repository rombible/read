The Hebrew word for "ashes is of somewhat doubtful meaning, being only used here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> (see margin). Being connected with the word "fat," it may perhaps mean the grease or dripping from the burnt offerings. The Targum of Palestine renders it "cinders." As the altar was hollow, and was filled with earth or stones when used, there would be no need to cleanse it from ashes; if this be the meaning of the word, the command would rather have been to collect the living embers before the altar was removed, in order to keep alive the sacred fire. That this fire was never allowed to go out may be looked upon as certain. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:4-20 The Kohathites were to carry the holy things of the tabernacle. All the holy things were to be covered; not only for security and respect, but to keep them from being seen. This not only marked the reverence due to holy things, but the mystery of the things signified by those types, and the darkness of the dispensation. But now, through Christ, the case is altered, and we are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace.</body></html>
