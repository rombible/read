A poetical word of somewhat doubtful meaning. It is generally supposed to be a verbal form (first person plural imperf. Kal), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, with an unusual suffix (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> has the primary meaning "to shoot at," the secondary, "to overthrow," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>. Others, however, derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>, a root supposed to mean "burn." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Even unto Dibon.</span> See on Numbers 32:34. The site of Nophah, perhaps the Nobah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>, is unknown. <span class="cmt_word">Which reacheth unto Medeba.</span> The reading is uncertain here as well as the meaning. The received text has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, which gives no meaning, but the circle over the <span class="accented">resh</span> marks it as suspicious. The Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;</span>) and the Samaritan evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and this has been generally followed: "we have wasted even unto Nophah, - with fire unto Medeba." Medeba, of which the ruins are still known by the same name, lay five or six miles south-south-east of Heshbon. It was a fortress in the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>) and of Omri, as appears from the Moabite stone. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:21-35 Sihon went with his forces against Israel, out of his own borders, without provocation, and so ran upon his own ruin. The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.</body></html>
