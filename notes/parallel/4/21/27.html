They may be rendered thus:--<p>"<span class= "ital">Come ye to Heshbon!<p>Let the city of Sihon be built up and restored!<p>For a fire went out from Heshbon--<p>A flame from the city of Sihon:<p>It devoured Ar </span>(<span class= "ital">or, the city</span>)<span class= "ital"> of Moab--<p>The lords of the high places of Arnon.<p>Woe to thee, Moab!</span><p><span class= "ital">Thou art perished, O people of Chemosh: </span><p><span class= "ital">He </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., Chemosh</span>)<span class= "ital"> gave up his sons as fugitives,</span><p><span class= "ital">And his daughters into captivity,</span><p><span class= "ital">Unto Sihon, the King of the Amorites.<p>We cast them down;<p>Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon:<p>Yea, we laid them waste even unto Nophah,<p>Which </span>(<span class= "ital">reacheth</span>)<span class= "ital"> even unto Medcba."</span><p>Or, if we read <span class= "ital">esh </span>(fire) instead of <span class= "ital">asher </span>(which), a reading which derives some support from the Masoretic point over the last letter and from the context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a>), as well as from the LXX., the last words may be rendered, "With fire, even unto Medeba."<p>The Targum understands by "the lords of the high places of Arnon" the priests and worshippers in the temples and at the altars of the idols in Moab. Medeba, now Medaba, was situated at the south of Heshbon. The position of Nophah is unknown. It has been supposed that it may be the same as Nebo, which is mentioned in connection with Dibon and Medeba in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm" title="He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.">Isaiah 15:2</a>, or with Arneibah, which lies to the east of Medeba.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that speak in proverbs.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. <span class="accented">Septuagint</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>. A class of persons well marked among the Hebrews, as perhaps in all ancient countries. It was their gift, and almost their profession, to express in the sententious, antistrophic poetry of the age such thoughts or such facts as took hold of men's minds. At a time when there was little difference between poetry and rhetoric, and when the distinction was hardly drawn between the inventive faculty of man and the Divine afflatus, it is not surprising to find the word <span class="accented">mashal</span> applied to the rhapsody of Balsam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>), to the "taunting song" of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>), to the "riddle" of Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>), as well as to the collection of earthly and heavenly wisdom in the Book of Proverbs. That which follows is a taunting song, most like to the one cited from Isaiah, the archaic character of which is marked by its strongly antithetic form and abrupt transitions, as well as by the peculiarity of some of the words. <span class="cmt_word">Come to Heshbon.</span> This may be ironically addressed to the Amorites, lately so victorious, now so overthrown; or, possibly, it may be intended to express the jubilation of the Amorites themselves in the day of their pride. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:21-35 Sihon went with his forces against Israel, out of his own borders, without provocation, and so ran upon his own ruin. The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.</body></html>
