The word appears to denote a particular kind of serpent, as in the following verse. Some think that they were so called because of the bright fiery red upon their heads; others because of the blazing sunbeams on their scales; and others because of their inflammatory and poisonous bite. Venomous snakes are said to abound still in the Arabah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fiery serpents,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. <span class="accented">Nachash</span> is the ordinary word for serpent. The word <span class="accented">saraph</span> which seems to mean "burning one," stands (by itself) for a serpent in verse 8, and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2, 6</a> it stands for one of the symbolic beings (seraphim) of the prophet's vision. The only idea common to the two meanings (otherwise so distinct) must be that of brilliance and metallic luster. It is commonly assumed that the "fiery" serpents were so called because of the burning pain and inflammation caused by the bite, after the analogy of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of Dioscorus and AElian. But is hardly possible that Isaiah should have used the same word in such wholly dissimilar senses, and it is clear from comparison with Ezekiel's vision of the cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>) that the <span class="accented">saraph</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> was so called from the burnished luster of his appearance. Even our Lord himself is described in the Apocalypse as having in the highest degree this appearance of glowing brass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>). It is further clear that the <span class="accented">saraph</span> was so named from his colour, not his venom, because when Moses was ordered to make a <span class="accented">saraph</span> he made a serpent of brass (or rather copper), with the evident intent of imitating as closely as possible the appearance of the venomous reptile. We may conclude then with some confidence that these serpents were of a fiery red colour, resembling in this respect certain very deadly snakes in Australia, which are known as "copper snakes." Travelers speak of some such pests as still abounding in the region of the Arabah, but it is quite uncertain whether the fiery serpents of that special visitation can be identified with any existing species. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:4-9 The children of Israel were wearied by a long march round the land of Edom. They speak discontentedly of what God had done for them, and distrustfully of what he would do. What will they be pleased with, whom manna will not please? Let not the contempt which some cast on the word of God, make us value it less. It is the bread of life, substantial bread, and will nourish those who by faith feed upon it, to eternal life, whoever may call it light bread. We see the righteous judgment God brought upon them for murmuring. He sent fiery serpents among them, which bit or stung many to death. It is to be feared that they would not have owned the sin, if they had not felt the smart; but they relent under the rod. And God made a wonderful provision for their relief. The Jews themselves say it was not the sight of the brazen serpent that cured; but in looking up to it, they looked up to God as the Lord that healed them. There was much gospel in this. Our Saviour declared, Joh 3:14,15, that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up, that whatsoever believeth in him, should not perish. Compare their disease and ours. Sin bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder. Compare the application of their remedy and ours. They looked and lived, and we, if we believe, shall not perish. It is by faith that we look unto Jesus, Heb 12:2. Whosoever looked, however desperate his case, or feeble his sight, or distant his place, was certainly and perfectly cured. The Lord can relieve us from dangers and distresses, by means which human reason never would have devised. Oh that the venom of the old serpent, inflaming men's passions, and causing them to commit sins which end in their eternal destruction, were as sensibly felt, and the danger as plainly seen, as the Israelites felt pain from the bite of the fiery serpents, and feared the death which followed! Then none would shut their eyes to Christ, or turn from his gospel. Then a crucified Saviour would be so valued, that all things else would be accounted loss for him; then, without delay, and with earnestness and simplicity, all would apply to him in the appointed way, crying, Lord, save us; we perish! Nor would any abuse the freeness of Christ's salvation, while they reckoned the price which it cost him.</body></html>
