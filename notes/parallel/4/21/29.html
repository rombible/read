Chemosh was the national god of the Moabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>), and also to some extent of the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>). It is generally agreed that the name is derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5e9;</span>, to subdue, and thus will have substantially the same meaning as Milcom, Molech, and Baal; indeed it appears probable that there was a strong family likeness among the idolatries of Palestine, and that the various names represented different attributes of one supreme being rather than different divinities. Thus Baal and Ashtaroth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>) represented for the Zidonians the masculine and feminine elements respectively in the Divine energy. Baal himself was plural (Baalim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18</a>) in form, and either male or female (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>). In the inscription on the Moabite stone a god "Ashtar-Chemosh" is mentioned, and thus Chemosh is identified with the male deity of Phoenicia (Ashtar being the masculine form of Ashtoreth), while, on the other hand, it was almost certainly the same divinity who was worshipped under another name, and with other rites, as Baal-Peor (see on Numbers 25:3). On the coins of Areopolis Chemosh appears as a god of war armed, with fire-torches by his side. Human sacrifices were offered to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-26.htm">2 Kings 3:26, 27</a>), as to Baal and to Moloch. He hath given his sons, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Chemosh, who could not save his own votaries, nor the children of his people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:21-35 Sihon went with his forces against Israel, out of his own borders, without provocation, and so ran upon his own ruin. The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.</body></html>
