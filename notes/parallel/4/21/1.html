(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-40.htm" title="And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelled in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.">Numbers 33:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-14.htm" title="The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16-17</a>.) The attack probably took place either in the interval between the departure of the messengers to Edom and their return, or at the time at which the Israelites broke up from Kadesh, and before the direction of their march had been ascertained. The word <span class= "ital">Atharim, </span>which is rendered in the Authorised Version <span class= "ital">spies, </span>may be another form of the word which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-6.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:">Numbers 14:6</a>, and which is there rendered <span class= "ital">them that searched; </span>or, as appears more probable, it may be the name of a place which does not occur elsewhere.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell.</span> Rather, "And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, which dwelt in the Negeb, heard tell." It is possible that Arad was the name of the king (it occurs as the name of a man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-15.htm">1 Chronicles 8:15</a>), but it was almost certainly the name of his place. The "king of Arad, is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>, and "the Negeb of Arad" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. From the context of these passages it is evident that it was situated in the southernmost district of what was afterwards the territory of Judah. According to Eusebius, it stood twenty Roman miles to the south of Hebron, and its site has been found by modern travelers at Tel-Arad, a low hill in this direction. On the Negeb see note on Numbers 13:17. <span class="cmt_word">By the way of the spies.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. The translation is very uncertain; <span class="accented">atharim</span> may be a proper name, as the Septuagint seems to suppose, or it may be an unusual plural formed from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "spies," as the Chaldee, Samaritan, and most of the versions take it; or it may be simply the plural from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, a place, used with some local meaning which made it practically a proper name. If the rendering of the A.V. be correct, "the way of the spies" must have been the route by which they ascended to Hebron through the Negeb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17, 22</a>), and the king of Arid must have anticipated an invasion in that direction, and sought to forestall it. <span class="cmt_word">And took some of them prisoners.</span> This would seem to show that he fell upon them unawares, and cut off some detached parties. Nothing is said of any disobedience on the part of Israel to account for defeat in battle. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-3 Before the people began their march round the country of Edom, the king of Arad, a Canaanite, who inhabited the southern part of the country, attacked them in the wilderness, and took some prisoners. This was to lead the Israelites to look more thoroughly to the Lord.</body></html>
