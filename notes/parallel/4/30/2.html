This, however, cannot be strictly maintained, because the Nazarite vow was <span class="accented">neder</span>, and that was essentially a vow of abstinence. To say that the vow of the Nazarite was of a positive character because he had to let his hair grow "unto the Lord" is a mere evasion. It is, however, probable that <span class="accented">neder</span>, when it occurs (as in this passage) in connection with <span class="accented">issar</span>, does take on the narrower signification of a positive vow. <span class="cmt_word">Swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond.</span> Literally, "to bind a bond upon his soul." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, a bond, which occurs only in this chapter, is considered to be a restrictive obligation, a vow of abstinence. It would appear that the <span class="accented">issar</span> was always undertaken upon oath, whereas the <span class="accented">neder</span> (as in the case of the Nazarite) did not of necessity require it. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall not break his word.</span> This was the general principle with respect to vows, and, as here ]aid down, it was in accordance with the universal religious feeling of mankind. Whatever crimes may have claimed the sanction of this sentiment, whatever exceptions and safeguards a clearer revelation and a better knowledge of God may have established, yet the principle remained that whatsoever a man had promised unto the Lord, that he must fulfill. Iphigenia in Aulis, Jephthah's daughter in Gilead, proclaim to what horrid extremities any one religious principle, unchecked by other coordinate principles, may lead; but they also proclaim how deep and true this religious principle must have been which could so over-ride the natural feelings of men not cruel nor depraved. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1,2 No man can be bound by his own promise to do what he is already, by the Divine precept, forbidden to do. In other matters the command is, that he shall not break his words, through he may change his mind.</body></html>
