It would appear upon the lace of it that we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, and in this chapter two fragments of Mosaic legislation dealing with the same subject, but, for some reason which it is useless to attempt to discover, widely separated in the inspired record. Nor does there seem to be any valid reason for explaining away the apparently fragmentary and dislocated character of these two sections (see the Introduction). The statement, peculiar to this passage, that these instructions were issued to the "heads of the tribes" itself serves to differentiate it from all the rest of the "statutes" given by Moses, and suggests that this chapter was inserted either by some other hand or from a different source. There is no reason whatever for supposing that the "heads of the tribes" were more interested in these particular regulations than in many others which concerned the social life of the people (such as that treated of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-5.htm">Numbers 5:5-31</a>) which were declared in the ordinary way unto "the children of Israel" at large. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1,2 No man can be bound by his own promise to do what he is already, by the Divine precept, forbidden to do.
