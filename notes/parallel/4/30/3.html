(2) that of a woman who is unmarried at the time of making a vow, but enters into the state of marriage before the vow is fulfilled; (3) that of a widow, or of a divorced woman; and (4) that of a married woman. The sanctity and obligations of the fifth commandment are distinctly recognised and enforced in these verses. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-4.htm" title="For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother: and, He that curses father or mother, let him die the death.">Matthew 15:4-5</a>.) Whenever the vow which the young daughter had made should come to the ears of her father, he had the power either to ratify or to disannul it. If he remained silent the vow was ratified; if he disallowed the vow, the obligation to fulfil it no longer remained in force.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a woman vow a vow.</span> The fragmentary nature of this section appears from the fact that, after laying down the general principle of the sacredness of vows, it proceeds to qualify it in three special cases only of vows made by women under authority. That vows made by boys were irreversible is exceedingly unlikely; and indeed it is obvious that many cases must have occurred, neither mentioned here nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, in which the obligation could not stand absolute. <span class="cmt_word">In her father's house in her youth.</span> Case first, of a girl in her father's house, who had no property of her own, and whose personal services were due to her father. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:3-16 Two cases of vows are determined. The case of a daughter in her father's house. When her vow comes to his knowledge, it is in his power either to confirm it or do it away. The law is plain in the case of a wife. If her husband allows her vow, though only by silence, it stands. If he disallows it, her obligation to her husband takes place of it; for to him she ought to be in subjection, as unto the Lord. The Divine law consults the good order of families. It is fit that every man should bear rule in his own house, and have his wife and children in subjection; rather than that this great rule should be broken, or any encouragement be given to inferior relations to break those bonds asunder, God releases the obligation even of a solemn vow. So much does religion secure the welfare of all societies; and in it the families of the earth have a blessing.</body></html>
