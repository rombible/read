Case second, of a married or betrothed woman. As far as the legal status of the woman was concerned, there was little difference under Jewish law whether she were married or only betrothed. In either case she was accounted as belonging to her husband, with all that she had (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">she vowed.</span> Rather, "and her vows be upon her." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>. The vows might have been made before her betrothal, and not disallowed by her father; yet upon her coming under the power of her husband he had an absolute right to dissolve the obligation of them; otherwise it is evident that he might suffer loss through an act of which he had no notice. <span class="cmt_word">Or</span> <span class="cmt_word">uttered ought out of her lips.</span> Rather, "or the rash utterance of her lips." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, which is not found elsewhere (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a>), seems to have this meaning. Such a vow made by a young girl as would be disallowed by her husband when he knew of it would presumably be a "rash utterance." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:3-16 Two cases of vows are determined. The case of a daughter in her father's house. When her vow comes to his knowledge, it is in his power either to confirm it or do it away. The law is plain in the case of a wife. If her husband allows her vow, though only by silence, it stands. If he disallows it, her obligation to her husband takes place of it; for to him she ought to be in subjection, as unto the Lord. The Divine law consults the good order of families. It is fit that every man should bear rule in his own house, and have his wife and children in subjection; rather than that this great rule should be broken, or any encouragement be given to inferior relations to break those bonds asunder, God releases the obligation even of a solemn vow. So much does religion secure the welfare of all societies; and in it the families of the earth have a blessing.</body></html>
