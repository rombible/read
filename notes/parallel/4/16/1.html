Korah, as the descendant of Izhar, the brother of Amram, who was the father (or. as some maintain, the more distant ancestor) of Moses and Aaron, may well be supposed <span class= "ital">to </span>have been jealous of the peculiar prerogatives of the priestly family, and also of the leadership of Elizaphan, the son of Uzziel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-30.htm" title="And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.">Numbers 3:30</a>), who appears to have been the youngest son of Kohath, whilst the name of Izhar stands next <span class= "ital">to </span>that of Amram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-19.htm" title="And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.">Numbers 3:19</a>). Dathan and Abiram, moreover, as the sons of Eliab, the son of Pallu, the son of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/26-5.htm" title="Reuben, the oldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, of whom comes the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of the Palluites:">Numbers 26:5-9</a>), who was the eldest son of Jacob, may, on like grounds, be supposed to have been discontented on account of the transference of the birthright, and the consequent loss of the leadership which had been possessed by their tribe, and which was now held by the tribe of Judah. It is possible that they may have regarded the priesthood also as amongst the prerogatives of the firstborn which should have descended to them. The proximity of the Kohathites to the Reubenites--for both were encamped on the south side of the Tabernacle--afforded opportunity for their common deliberations; and it has been inferred by some, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/16-24.htm" title="Speak to the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.">Numbers 16:24-27</a>, that they had erected a tabernacle in rivalry with the Tabernacle of the Congregation. No further mention is made of the name of On, nor is he expressly included in the account of the final punishment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Korah... took men.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>. The word "took" stands alone at the head of the sentence in the singular number. This does not by itself confine its reference to Korah, because it may be taken as repeated after each of the other names; at the same time, the construction suggests that in its original form Korah alone was mentioned, and that the other names were afterwards added in order to include them in the same statement. The ellipsis after "took" (if it be one) may be filled up by "men," as in the A.V. and in most versions, or by "counsel," as in the Jerusalem Targum. The Septuagint has in place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, representing apparently a different reading. Some commentators regard it as an anacoluthon for "took two hundred and fifty men... and rose up with them;" others, again, treat the "took" as a pleonasm, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a> and elsewhere; but the change of number from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> makes it difficult. It seems best to say that the construction is broken and cannot be satisfactorily explained. Indeed there can be no question that the whole narrative, like the construction of the opening verses, is rely confused, and leaves on the mind the impression that it has been altered, not very skillfully, from its original form. The two parts of the tragedy, that concerning the company of Korah, and that concerning the Reubenites, although mingled in the narrative, do not adjust themselves in the mind, and the general effect is obscure. It is sufficient to point out here that no one can certainly tell what became of the ringleader himself, who was obviously the head and front of the whole business. Some are strenuously of opinion that he was swallowed up alive, others as strenuously that he was consumed with fire; but the simple fact is that his death is not recorded in this chapter at all, although he is assumed to have perished. The obscurity which hangs over this passage cannot be traced to any certain cause; the discrepancies and contradictions which have been discovered in it are clue to mistake or misrepresentation; nor can any evil motive be plausibly assigned for the interpolation (if it be such) of that part of the story which concerns the Reubenites. If, for some reason unknown to us, an original narrative of Korah's rebellion was enlarged so as to include the simultaneous mutiny of the Reubenites and their fate; and if, further, that enlargement was so unskillfully made as to leave considerable confusion in the narrative, wherein does that affect either its truth or its inspiration? The supernatural influence which watched over the production of the sacred narrative certainly did not interfere with any of those natural causes which affected its composition, its style, its clearness or obscurity. <span class="cmt_word">Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi.</span> On the genealogy of the Levites see Exodus 6:16-22, and above on Numbers 3:17-19. It is generally supposed that some generations are passed over in these genealogies. Korah belonged to the same Kohathite sub-tribe as Moses and Aaron, and was related to them by some sort of cousinship; his father (or ancestor) Izhar was the younger brother of Amram and the elder brother of Uzziel, whose descendant Elizaphan had been made chief of the Kohathites. <span class="cmt_word">Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab.</span> Eliab himself was apparently the only son of Pallu, the second son of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5, 8</a>). If the word "son" is to be literally understood in all these cases, then Korah, Dathan, and Abiram would all be great-great-grandsons of Jacob himself. <span class="cmt_word">On, the son of Peleth.</span> It is one of the strange obscurities of this narrative that On, who appears here as a ringleader, is never mentioned again either in this chapter or elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">Sons of Reuben.</span> Reubenites. The encampment of their tribe was on the south side of the tabernacle in the outer line (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-10.htm">Numbers 2:10</a>), while that of the Kohathites was on the same side in the inner line. Thus they were to some extent neighbours; but see below on verse 24. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-11 Pride and ambition occasion a great deal of mischief both in churches and states. The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthood upon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so often and so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour to themselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. What spirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set over them. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses sought instruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and asks counsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convicts them of the sin of undervaluing these privileges. It will help to keep us from envying those above us, duly to consider how many there are below us.</body></html>
