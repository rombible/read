At the same time, the attack of Korah and his company (with whom alone the narrative is really concerned here) was directed especially against the ecclesiastical rule which Moses exercised through his brother Aaron. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">take too much upon you.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, "much for you," probably in the sense of "enough for you" (cf. the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-28.htm">Genesis 45:28</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, you have enjoyed power long enough; so the Targum Palestine. It may, however, be taken with the following <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as meaning, "let it suffice you that all the congregation," etc.; and so the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> The Targum of Onkelos renders it in the same sense as the A.V. <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">the congregation are holy, every one of them.</span> This was perfectly true, m a sense. There was a sanctity which pertained to Israel as a nation, in which all its members shared as distinguished from the nations around (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>); there was a priesthood which was inherent in all the sons of Israel, older and more indelible than that which was conferred on Aaron's line - a priesthood which, apart from special restrictions, or in exceptional circumstances, might and did assert itself in priestly acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and compare the cases of Samuel, Elijah, and others who offered sacrifice during the failure of the appointed priesthood). It Moses had taken the power to himself, or it he had (as they doubtless supposed) restricted active priestly functions to Aaron because he was his brother, and wholly under his influence, their contention would have been quite right. They erred, as most violent men do, not because they asserted what was false, but because they took for granted that the truth which they asserted was really inconsistent with the claims which they assailed. The congregation were all holy; the sons of Israel were all priests; that was true - but it was also true that by Divine command Israel could only exercise his corporate priesthood outwardly through the one family which God had set apart for that purpose. The same God who has lodged in the body certain faculties and powers for the benefit of the body, has decreed that those faculties and powers can only be exercised through certain determinate organs, the very specialization of which is both condition and result of a high organization. <span class="cmt_word">The congregation of the Lord.</span> There are two words for congregation in this verse: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> here, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> before. The former seems to be used in the more solemn sense, but they are for the most part indistinguishable, and certainly cannot be assigned to different authors. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-11 Pride and ambition occasion a great deal of mischief both in churches and states. The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthood upon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so often and so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour to themselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. What spirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set over them. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses sought instruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and asks counsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convicts them of the sin of undervaluing these privileges. It will help to keep us from envying those above us, duly to consider how many there are below us.</body></html>
