but it is impossible to say that Moses did not err through anger. <span class="cmt_word">Respect not thou their offering.</span> Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>. It is not quite clear what offering Moses meant, since they do not seem to have wished to offer incense. Probably it was equivalent to saying, Do not thou accept them when they approach thee; for such approach was always by sacrifice (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have not taken one ass from them.</span> Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>. The ass was the least valuable of the ordinary live stock of those days (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>). The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;</span>, which is apparently an intentional paraphrase with a reference to the tenth commandment (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither have I hurt one of them.</span> As absolute ruler he might have made himself very burdensome to all, and very terrible to his personal enemies. Compare Samuel's description of the Eastern autocrat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11-17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:12-15 Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram to bring their complaints; but they would not obey. They bring very false charges against Moses. Those often fall under the heaviest censures, who in truth deserve the highest praise. Moses, though the meekest man, yet, finding God reproached in him, was very wroth; he could not bear to see the people ruining themselves. He appeals to God as to his own integrity. He bade them appear with Aaron next morning, at the time of offering the morning incense. Korah undertook thus to appear. Proud ambitious men, while projecting their own advancement, often hurry on their own shameful fall.</body></html>
