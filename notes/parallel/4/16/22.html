The <span class="accented">ruach</span> is the spirit of life which the Creator has imparted unto perishable flesh, and made it live. In some sense it belongs to beasts as well as to men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19, 21</a>); but in the common use of the word men only are thought of, as having received it by a special communication of a higher order (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>).

Nothing is more terrible to those who are conscious of guilt, than the appearance of the Divine glory. See how dangerous it is to have fellowship with sinners, and to partake with them. Though the people had treacherously deserted them, yet Moses and Aaron approved themselves faithful shepherds of Israel.
