to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.">Exodus 3:8</a>) concerning the deliverance from Egypt, and the bringing of the people into a land flowing with milk and honey, had been communicated by Aaron to the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-30.htm" title="And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.">Exodus 4:30</a>).

It is probably used here in the same manner; or, it may be, to denote an alleged attempt on the part of Moses to blind the eyes of the people to the violation of promises solemnly made to them, and to impose upon them a law of blind obedience to his own arbitrary injunctions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover thou hast not brought us.</span> According to the promises (they meant to say) by which he had induced them to leave their comfortable homes in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30, 31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Wilt</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou put out the eyes of these men?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, wilt thou blind them to the utter failure of thy plans and promises? wilt thou throw dust in their eyes? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:12-15 Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram to bring their complaints; but they would not obey. They bring very false charges against Moses. Those often fall under the heaviest censures, who in truth deserve the highest praise. Moses, though the meekest man, yet, finding God reproached in him, was very wroth; he could not bear to see the people ruining themselves. He appeals to God as to his own integrity. He bade them appear with Aaron next morning, at the time of offering the morning incense. Korah undertook thus to appear. Proud ambitious men, while projecting their own advancement, often hurry on their own shameful fall.</body></html>
