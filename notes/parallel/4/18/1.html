and it shall be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.">Exodus 28:38</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord spake unto Aaron.</span> This clear and comprehensive instruction as to the position and support of the sons of Aaron on the one hand, and of the Levites on the other, may very naturally have been given in connection with the events just narrated. There is, however, no direct reference to those events, and it is quite possible that the only connection was one of subject-matter in the mind of the writer. That the regulations which follow were addressed to Aaron directly is a thing unusual, and indeed unexampled. The ever-recurring statement elsewhere is, "the Lord spake unto Moses," varied occasionally by "the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-1.htm">Numbers 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-1.htm">Numbers 19:1</a>); but even where the communication refers to things wholly and peculiarly within the province of Aaron, it is usually made to Moses, and only through him to his brother (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-1.htm">Numbers 8:1-3</a>). This change in the form of the message may point to a later date, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to a time subsequent to the gainsaying of Korah, when the separate position of Aaron as the head of a priestly caste was more fully recognized than before, and he himself somewhat less under the shadow of his greater brother. <span class="cmt_word">Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the sanctuary.</span> Aaron's father's house, according to the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2, 3, 6</a>, was the sub-tribe of the Kohathites, and these had charge (to the exclusion of the other Levites) of the sanctuary, or rather sacred things (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). See on Numbers 4:15. This mention of the Kohathites in connection with the sanctuary is an incidental proof that these instructions were given in view of the wanderings in the wilderness, for after the settlement in Canaan no Levites (as such) came into contact with the sacred furniture. It is not easy to define exactly the meaning of "shall bear the iniquity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of the sanctuary." The general sense of the phrase is, "to be responsible for the iniquity," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, for anything which caused displeasure in the eyes of God, "in connection with the sacred things and the service of them;" hence it meant either to be responsible for such iniquity, as being held accountable for it, and having to endure the penalty, or as being permitted and enabled to take such accountability on oneself, and so discharge it from others. This double sense is exactly reflected in the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as applied to our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The priests, therefore (and the Kohathites, so far as they had anything to do with the sanctuary), were responsible for all the unholiness attaching or accruing to it, not only by reason of all offences committed by themselves, but by reason of that imperfection which clung to them at the best, and made them unworthy to handle the things of God. In a further and deeper sense they might be said to be vicariously responsible for all the iniquity of all Israel, so far as the taint of it affected the very sanctuary (see on Exodus 28:38; Leviticus 16:16). <span class="cmt_word">The iniquity of your priesthood.</span> The responsibility not only for all sinful acts of omission and commission in Divine service (such as those of Nadab and Abihu, and of Korah), but for all the inevitable failure of personal holiness on the part of those who ministered unto the Lord. This responsibility was emphatically recognized and provided for in the rites of the great day of atonement. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-7 The people complained of their difficulty and peril in drawing near to God. God here gives them to understand, that the priests should come near for them. Aaron would see reason not to be proud of his preferment, when he considered the great care and charge upon him. Be not high-minded, but fear. The greater the trust of work and power that is committed to us, the greater danger there is of betraying that trust. This is a good reason why we should neither envy others' honours, nor desire high places.</body></html>
