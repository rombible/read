This expression is somewhat perplexing, because it stands commonly for the holy of holies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>). As it cannot possibly have that meaning here, two interpretations have been proposed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That it means the court of the tabernacle, called "the holy place" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>, and there specified as the only place in which the meat offerings, the sin offerings, and trespass offerings might be eaten. There is no reason why this court should not be called "must holy," as well as "holy;" if it was "holy" with respect to the camp, or the holy city, it was "most holy" with respect to all without the camp, or without the gate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the expression does not mean "in the most holy place," but "amongst the most holy things," as it does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, and above in verse 9. A distinction is clearly intended between the "most holy things," which only the priests and their sons might eat, and the "holy things," of which the rest of their families might partake also. It is difficult to decide between these renderings, although there can be no doubt that the "most holy" things were actually to be consumed within the tabernacle precincts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:8-19 All believers are spiritual priests, and God has promised to take care of them. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is. And from the provision here made for the priests, the apostle shows that it is the duty of christian churches to maintain their ministers. Scandalous maintenance makes scandalous ministers. The priests were to be wholly devoted to their ministry, not diverted from it, or disturbed in it, by worldly care or business. Also, that they might be examples of living by faith, not only in God's providence, but in his ordinances. The best should be offered for the first-fruits unto the Lord. Those who think to save, by putting God off with the refuse, deceive themselves, for God is not mocked.</body></html>
