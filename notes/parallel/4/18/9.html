The burnt offering is not mentioned because it was wholly consumed, and only the skin fell to the priest. The sin offerings for the priest or for the congregation were also wholly consumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-12.htm">Leviticus 4:12, 21</a>), but the sin offerings of private individuals, although in no case partaken of by the offerers, were available for the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>), and this was the ordinary case. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:8-19 All believers are spiritual priests, and God has promised to take care of them. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is. And from the provision here made for the priests, the apostle shows that it is the duty of christian churches to maintain their ministers. Scandalous maintenance makes scandalous ministers. The priests were to be wholly devoted to their ministry, not diverted from it, or disturbed in it, by worldly care or business. Also, that they might be examples of living by faith, not only in God's providence, but in his ordinances. The best should be offered for the first-fruits unto the Lord. Those who think to save, by putting God off with the refuse, deceive themselves, for God is not mocked.</body></html>
