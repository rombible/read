The altar (of burnt offering) and "that within the vail (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>) were the two points between which the exclusive duties of the priesthood lay, including the service of the holy place. <span class="cmt_word">A service of gift.</span> A service which was not to be regarded as a burden, or a misfortune, or as a natural heritage and accident of birth, but to be received and cherished as a favour accorded to them by the goodness of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-7 The people complained of their difficulty and peril in drawing near to God. God here gives them to understand, that the priests should come near for them. Aaron would see reason not to be proud of his preferment, when he considered the great care and charge upon him. Be not high-minded, but fear. The greater the trust of work and power that is committed to us, the greater danger there is of betraying that trust. This is a good reason why we should neither envy others' honours, nor desire high places.</body></html>
