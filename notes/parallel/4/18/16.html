27:2-7. It would seem that the priest was to make the valuation for the people, since each first-born or firstling was separately claimed by God, and had to be separately redeemed; but at the same time, to prevent extortion, the sum which the priest might assess was fixed by God. <span class="cmt_word">For the money of five shekels.</span> About seventeen shillings of our money (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>). It is extremely drill cult to estimate the number of first-born, but it is evident that in any case a large income must have accrued to the priests in this way. No value is here set upon the firstlings of unclean beasts; in the most usual ease, that of the ass, the rule had been laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>; and in other cases it was apparently left to the discretion of the priests, subject to the right of the owner, if he saw fit, to destroy the animal rather than pay for it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-27.htm">Leviticus 27:27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:8-19 All believers are spiritual priests, and God has promised to take care of them. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is. And from the provision here made for the priests, the apostle shows that it is the duty of christian churches to maintain their ministers. Scandalous maintenance makes scandalous ministers. The priests were to be wholly devoted to their ministry, not diverted from it, or disturbed in it, by worldly care or business. Also, that they might be examples of living by faith, not only in God's providence, but in his ordinances. The best should be offered for the first-fruits unto the Lord. Those who think to save, by putting God off with the refuse, deceive themselves, for God is not mocked.</body></html>
