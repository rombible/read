Cedar-wood may be regarded as the emblem of fragrance and incorruption; hyssop as the emblem of purification; and scarlet (or crimson) wool or cloth may be regarded as emblematical both of sin, which is compared to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm" title="Come now, and let us reason together, said the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.">Isaiah 1:18</a>, and also of the blood, which is the life, the shedding of which was needful in order to the remission of sin. All of these were used in the purification of the leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm" title="Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:">Leviticus 14:4</a>). In both cases there appears to be a typical reference to the sprinkling of the blood of Christ. (See. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.</span> See on Leviticus 14:4-6 for the significance of these things. The antiseptic and medicinal qualities of the cedar (<span class="accented">Juniperus oxycedrus</span>) and hyssop (probably <span class="accented">Capparis spinosa</span>) make their use readily intelligible; the symbolism of the "scarlet" is much more obscure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 The heifer was to be wholly burned. This typified the painful sufferings of our Lord Jesus, both in soul and body, as a sacrifice made by fire, to satisfy God's justice for man's sin. These ashes are said to be laid up as a purification for sin, because, though they were only to purify from ceremonial uncleanness, yet they were a type of that purification for sin which our Lord Jesus made by his death. The blood of Christ is laid up for us in the word and sacraments, as a fountain of merit, to which by faith we may have constant recourse, for cleansing our consciences.</body></html>
