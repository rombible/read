As no directions were given concerning it, it was probably the bare earth cleared and stamped. The cedar floor of the temple was overlaid with gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16, 30</a>). This use of the dust has been held to signify the fact <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that man was made of dust, and must return to dust (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that dust is the serpent's meat, i.e., that shame and disgust are the inevitable fruit of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>). Of these, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> is not appropriate to the matter in question, since mortality is common to all, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> is far too recondite to have been intended here. It is very unlikely that the spiritual meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a> was known to any of the Jews. A much simpler and more intelligible explanation is to be found in the obvious fact that the dust of the tabernacle was the only thing which belonged to the tabernacle, and which was, so to speak, impregnated with the awful holiness of him that dwelt therein, that could be mixed with water and drunk. For a similar reason the "sin" of the people, the golden calf, was ground to powder, and the people made to drink it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>). The idea conveyed to the dullest apprehension certainly was that with the holy dust Divine "virtue" had passed into the water - virtue which would give it supernatural efficacy to slay the guilty and to leave the guiltless unharmed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:11-31 This law would make the women of Israel watch against giving cause for suspicion. On the other hand, it would hinder the cruel treatment such suspicions might occasion. It would also hinder the guilty from escaping, and the innocent from coming under just suspicion. When no proof could be brought, the wife was called on to make this solemn appeal to a heart-searching God. No woman, if she were guilty, could say Amen to the adjuration, and drink the water after it, unless she disbelieved the truth of God, or defied his justice. The water is called the bitter water, because it caused the curse. Thus sin is called an evil and a bitter thing. Let all that meddle with forbidden pleasures, know that they will be bitterness in the latter end. From the whole learn, 1. Secret sins are known to God, and sometimes are strangely brought to light in this life; and that there is a day coming when God will, by Christ, judge the secrets of men according to the gospel, Ro 2:16. 2 In particular, Whoremongers and adulterers God will surely judge. Though we have not now the waters of jealousy, yet we have God's word, which ought to be as great a terror. Sensual lusts will end in bitterness. 3. God will manifest the innocency of the innocent. The same providence is for good to some, and for hurt to others. And it will answer the purposes which God intends.</body></html>
