"There is nothing in it as it seems saving the King." This remark may well be thought needless; but the misconceptions and misrepresentations of the Christian's hope have been many and reckless; and, even were this not the case, there is always a certain proportion of people who seem incapable of understanding figurative language. Half the errors of the Church have been due to prosaic-minded men who could not discern the difference between figure and fact; and men of unpoetical and vehement temperament have blundered over these descriptions, and their blunders have discredited the whole Apocalypse in the eyes of some. The following are the features of the heavenly city, which the description seems designed to enforce upon our thoughts. The great and holy community will be one which draws its glory from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-11.htm" title="Having the glory of God: and her light was like to a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;">Revelation 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm" title="And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>). Its blessings are not for a few, but open to all, for its gates lie open to all quarters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-12.htm" title="And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:">Revelation 21:12-13</a>). The heavenly and the earthly will be at one; angels, apostles, and patriarchs are there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm" title="And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:">Revelation 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>). Diverse characters will find entrance there; the gates bear the names of the twelve tribes. The door of admission is alike for all, though diverse characters from diverse quarters will enter in (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-21.htm" title="And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.">Revelation 21:21</a>). It will be the abode of all that is fair and good, and no disproportions will mar its loveliness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-17.htm" title="And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.">Revelation 21:17-18</a>). The ancient truths, spoken by various lips, will be found to be eternal truths, full of varied but consistent beauty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-19.htm" title="And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;">Revelation 21:19-20</a>). The forms and helps which were needful here will not be needful there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-22.htm" title="And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.">Revelation 21:22-23</a>); all that the servants of God have righteously hungered and thirsted for here will be supplied there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1-2</a>). There will be blessings, various, continuous, eternal; new fields of labour and new possibilities of service will be opened there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3-4</a>).<p>(9) <span class= "bld">And there came unto me one of the seven angels . . .</span>--The words "unto me" should be omitted. One of the seven angels which had the seven vials of wrath had shown to the seer the scarlet-clad harlot, the great and guilty Babylon: so here does one of the same company of angels show him the pure Bride of the Lamb, the new and holy Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues.</span> Omit "unto me." "Full of" must be connected with "angels." Just as these angels had carried out God's judgments upon the ungodly, and one of them had exhibited the judgment of the harlot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>), so now one of them shows the picture of the bliss of the faithful - the bride of the Lamb. <span class="cmt_word">And talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife;</span> <span class="accented">hither</span> (omitting "come"). The wording of this verse (except the last phrase) is almost identical with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>. The last phrase is the great contrast to the former chapter. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. I was seen a picture of a harlot, the unfaithful part of Christ's Church; here we have a description of those who have been "faithful unto death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>), and whose purity and faithfulness are symbolized under the figure of the "wife of the Lamb" (see on Revelation 17:1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:9-21 God has various employments for his holy angels. Sometimes they sound the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation. Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.</body></html>
