Gold is one of the features of the city; the street is gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-18.htm" title="And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like to clear glass.">Revelation 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-21.htm" title="And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.">Revelation 21:21</a>); it may stand, as a token of the wealth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-15.htm" title="And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.">Psalm 72:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/10-14.htm" title="Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred three score and six talents of gold,">1Kings 10:14-21</a>) of the royal city; but the wealth of that city is love. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-18.htm" title="I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.">Revelation 3:18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof;</span> <span class="accented">had for a measure a golden reed to measure</span>, etc. "He that spake" is the angel of ver. 9 (cf. the action of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-15.htm">Ezekiel 42:15</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>).

Sometimes they sound the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation. Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.</body></html>
