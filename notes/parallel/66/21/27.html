The emphatic repetition here (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>) of the idea that all sin is excluded, is in harmony with all other Scripture: no unholiness can dwell in the presence of God. The allusion is to the care of the Jews to exclude all things unclean from the precincts of the sanctuary. The legal and ceremonial defilement had its spiritual significance, which the Apostles utilised elsewhere. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="Why come out from among them, and be you separate, said the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.">2Corinthians 6:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm" title="And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues.">Revelation 18:4</a>. On the "book of life," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie;</span> <span class="accented">anything unclean, or he that doeth an abomination, and a lie.</span> It is thus evident that "the nations" of ver. 24 are among the redeemed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1</a>, "O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean").

And what words can more full express the union and co-equality of the Son with the Father, in the Godhead? What a dismal world would this be, if it were not for the light of the sun! What is there in heaven that supplies its place? The glory of God lightens that city, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. God in Christ will be an everlasting Fountain of knowledge and joy to the saints in heaven. There is no night, therefore no need of shutting the gates; all is at peace and secure. The whole shows us that we should be more and more led to think of heaven as filled with the glory of God, and enlightened by the presence of the Lord Jesus. Nothing sinful or unclean, idolatrous, or false and deceitful, can enter. All the inhabitants are made perfect in holiness. Now the saints feel a sad mixture of corruption, which hinders them in the service of God, and interrupts their communion with him; but, at their entrance into the holy of holies, they are washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and presented to the Father without spot. None are admitted into heaven who work abominations. It is free from hypocrites, such as make lies. As nothing unclean can enter heaven, let us be stirred up by these glimpses of heavenly things, to use all diligence, and to perfect holiness in the fear of God.</body></html>
