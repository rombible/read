The assurance is made trebly sure. "I am making all things new." "These words are true." "They are fulfilled." "Twice," says Bengel, "twice it is said in this book 'It is done.' First at the completion of the wrath of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-17.htm" title="And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.">Revelation 16:17</a>, and here again at the making of all things new."<p><span class= "bld">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end . . .</span>--The definite article must be placed before Alpha and Omega. <span class= "ital">I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.</span> He is the Alpha and Omega, whose words are faithful and true, and He is the beginning and the end, who is before all things and by whom all things consist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>). He finishes as well as begins. He who begins the good work will perform it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm" title="Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>); all grace flows from Him; and all love flows back to Him, who is Love, who is the cause and end of all, who first makes us, and lastly makes us rest in Him. All the unsatisfied yearnings of the heart may find satisfaction in Him. Hence, perhaps, this promise, <span class= "ital">I to him that thirsteth will give out of the spring of the water of life freely.</span> No promise shall fail--the needy and thirsty so often invited to Him may find fresh springs of life in Him. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.">John 4:10-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37-38</a>.) The blessing is promised freely, as an unbought gift, without money and without price. This is the genius of the good news of God--the gift is free to all. He who understands this will not be afraid to say, "Nothing in my hand I bring;" and he who says this will be he who will also say, "What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ," so that he who brings everything brings nothing; and he who brings nothing brings everything, knowing that all is nothing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me, It is done;</span> <span class="accented">and he said unto me, They are come to pass</span> (Revised Version). It is uncertain what is the nominative intended. It may be the "words" just mentioned; or the incidents described in vers. 1-5; or the Divine promises and judgments in general. The analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a> supports the last, but it is not conclusive. <span class="cmt_word">I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End;</span> <span class="accented">the Alpha and the Omega.</span> As the book opens, so it closes, with the solemn assurance of the certainty and unchangeableness of God's eternal promises (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>). The second clause interprets the first; a third form of expressing the same idea occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>, "the First and the Last." I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. The same ideas are repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13-17</a>. Again the symbolism of the prophet (cf. ver. 3). There is also another reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> (cf. also ver. 4 of this chapter). In exactly the same sense the words, "living water," are used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, "thirst after righteousness"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-8 The new heaven and the new earth will not be separate from each other; the earth of the saints, their glorified, bodies, will be heavenly. The old world, with all its troubles and tumults, will have passed away. There will be no sea; this aptly represents freedom from conflicting passions, temptations, troubles, changes, and alarms; from whatever can divide or interrupt the communion of saints. This new Jerusalem is the church of God in its new and perfect state, the church triumphant. Its blessedness came wholly from God, and depends on him. The presence of God with his people in heaven, will not be interrupt as it is on earth, he will dwell with them continually. All effects of former trouble shall be done away. They have often been in tears, by reason of sin, of affliction, of the calamities of the church; but no signs, no remembrance of former sorrows shall remain. Christ makes all things new. If we are willing and desirous that the gracious Redeemer should make all things new in order hearts and nature, he will make all things new in respect of our situation, till he has brought us to enjoy complete happiness. See the certainty of the promise. God gives his titles, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, as a pledge for the full performance. Sensual and sinful pleasures are muddy and poisoned waters; and the best earthly comforts are like the scanty supplies of a cistern; when idolized, they become broken cisterns, and yield only vexation. But the joys which Christ imparts are like waters springing from a fountain, pure, refreshing, abundant, and eternal. The sanctifying consolations of the Holy Spirit prepare for heavenly happiness; they are streams which flow for us in the wilderness. The fearful durst not meet the difficulties of religion, their slavish fear came from their unbelief; but those who were so dastardly as not to dare to take up the cross of Christ, were yet so desperate as to run into abominable wickedness. The agonies and terrors of the first death will lead to the far greater terrors and agonies of eternal death.</body></html>
