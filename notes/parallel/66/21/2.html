The name John is omitted in the best MSS. The new Jerusalem is more fully described later on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm" title="And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,">Revelation 21:10</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The city is also the bride (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9-10</a>). Both images--the "city" and the "bride"--are familiar to the Bible student. The sacred city appears linked to God by a sacred bond. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/45-13.htm" title="The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of worked gold.">Psalm 45:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm" title="I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/62-4.htm" title="You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.">Isaiah 62:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>.) The city-bride is now adorned for her Husband. We know what her ornaments are, now that He is about to present her to Himself a glorious Church: the meekness and gentleness of Christ, and her loving obedience to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm" title="But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.">1Peter 3:4</a>), are her jewels. She is seen, not rising from earth or sea, like the foes of righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-11.htm" title="And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.">Revelation 13:11</a>), but coming down from heaven. The world will never evolve a golden age or ideal state. The new Jerusalem must descend from God. The true pattern, which alone will realise man's highest wishes, is the pattern in the mount of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-44.htm" title="Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.">Acts 7:44</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem.</span> "John" must be omitted, according to all the best manuscripts. "The holy city" is the Church of God (see on Revelation 11:2), now glorified and prepared for perfect communion with her Redeemer (cf. the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, which is now fulfilled; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10, 16</a>). Contrast this figure of the <span class="accented">holy city</span> with that of Babylon (see on Revelation 18.). <span class="cmt_word">Coming down from God out of heaven.</span> Connect "out of heaven" with "coming down." The same words occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> (which see). <span class="cmt_word">Prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</span> Here is the contrast to the "harlot" (see on Revelation 17:1). Though many of those forming the <span class="accented">bride</span> are rewarded according to their works (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>), yet their own works are insufficient to fit them for their future life; they are <span class="accented">prepared</span> by God. This appearance is anticipated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a> (which see). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-8 The new heaven and the new earth will not be separate from each other; the earth of the saints, their glorified, bodies, will be heavenly. The old world, with all its troubles and tumults, will have passed away. There will be no sea; this aptly represents freedom from conflicting passions, temptations, troubles, changes, and alarms; from whatever can divide or interrupt the communion of saints. This new Jerusalem is the church of God in its new and perfect state, the church triumphant. Its blessedness came wholly from God, and depends on him. The presence of God with his people in heaven, will not be interrupt as it is on earth, he will dwell with them continually. All effects of former trouble shall be done away. They have often been in tears, by reason of sin, of affliction, of the calamities of the church; but no signs, no remembrance of former sorrows shall remain. Christ makes all things new. If we are willing and desirous that the gracious Redeemer should make all things new in order hearts and nature, he will make all things new in respect of our situation, till he has brought us to enjoy complete happiness. See the certainty of the promise. God gives his titles, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, as a pledge for the full performance. Sensual and sinful pleasures are muddy and poisoned waters; and the best earthly comforts are like the scanty supplies of a cistern; when idolized, they become broken cisterns, and yield only vexation. But the joys which Christ imparts are like waters springing from a fountain, pure, refreshing, abundant, and eternal. The sanctifying consolations of the Holy Spirit prepare for heavenly happiness; they are streams which flow for us in the wilderness. The fearful durst not meet the difficulties of religion, their slavish fear came from their unbelief; but those who were so dastardly as not to dare to take up the cross of Christ, were yet so desperate as to run into abominable wickedness. The agonies and terrors of the first death will lead to the far greater terrors and agonies of eternal death.</body></html>
