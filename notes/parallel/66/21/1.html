Earlier prophets had sanctioned the hope: Isaiah had told of new heavens and new earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm" title="For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.">Isaiah 65:17</a>); Ezekiel had closed his prophecy with the splendid vision of a renewed land of promise (Ezekiel 40-48); Christ Himself had spoken of the era which He inaugurated as the regeneration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>); His followers soon caught the truth that the outcome of the gospel age would be the realisation of all those marvellous visions with which prophets had sustained the fainting hopes of the people of God. The hope was not to be for ever receding as new height after height was surmounted. It will not always be said, "The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm" title="Son of man, what is that proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?">Ezekiel 12:22</a>). The fulfilment may seem to tarry; the unbelieving might doubt or scoff (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm" title="But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>); but those who felt that the gospel was a power of spiritual regeneration, making all things new (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>), learned to look forward to the widest and fullest restoration, and to expect new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a>). The characteristic word which runs throughout the description is the word "<span class= "ital">new."</span> All things are to be made <span class= "ital">new:</span> the heavens and earth are <span class= "ital">new;</span> the Jerusalem is <span class= "ital">new.</span> There are two words which are translated <span class= "ital">new</span> in our English version: one of these (<span class= "ital">neos</span>) relates to time; the other (<span class= "ital">kainos</span>) relates to quality. The one would be applied to what had recently come into existence; the other to what showed fresh features. The tomb, for example, in which our Lord's body was laid was new, not in the sense that it had been recently hewn out of the rock, but in the sense that it had never been used before; it may have been long made, but it was one wherein never man was yet laid. To describe it the second word (<span class= "ital">kainos</span>) is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-60.htm" title="And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, and departed.">Matthew 27:60</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-41.htm" title="Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid.">John 19:41</a>). In the same way, the wine-skins (called "bottles" in our English version) required for the new wine were not necessarily wine-skins only just prepared for service, but they were skins which had not grown withered, but retained their freshness and elasticity. Here, again, the second word (<span class= "ital">kainos</span>) is employed to describe them. Now, it is this latter word which is used throughout this chapter, and, indeed, throughout the book of Revelation. The newness which is pictured is the newness of freshness: the old, decaying, enfeebling, and corrupting elements are swept away. The aspects and features which will surround the inhabitants of that new earth will be full of novelty to satisfy the progressive instincts of our nature; but the imagery no less conveys the assurance that the conservative instinct, which clings to what is old, and finds sanctity in the past, will not be disregarded. All things may be new, full of fresh and fair beauty; but all things will not be <span class= "ital">strange;</span> there must be some correspondency between the old and the new, when the new things are called new <span class= "ital">heavens, </span>new <span class= "ital">earth, </span>new <span class= "ital">Jerusalem.</span> The description is figurative, but the spirit of it implies that in the restitution age the sweetness of things loved and familiar will blend with the charm of all that is fresh and new.<p><span class= "bld">And there</span> <span class= "bld">was no</span> <span class= "bld">more sea.</span>--Or, better, <span class= "ital">And the sea is </span>(<span class= "ital">exists</span>)<span class= "ital"> not any more.</span> Among the more detailed features of the new earth, this obliteration of the sea stands first. It is strange that so many commentators should vacillate between literal and figurative interpretations of the chapter; the ornaments and decorations of the new Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-10.htm" title="And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,">Revelation 21:10-21</a>) are treated as symbolical; the annihilation of the sea is considered as literal. It is wiser to leave the literal meaning to the future, and to grasp the spiritual teachings, which are of infinite and present interest, The <span class= "ital">sea</span> has played an important part in the symbolism of the book: out of the sea rose the wild beast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>); the purple-clad Babylon sat enthroned upon many waters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>); the restless, tumultuous ocean, now discordant with its clamorous waves, now flooding the earth in confederate force; the troubled sea of evil, which cannot rest, and casts up but mire and dirt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-21.htm" title="There is no peace, said my God, to the wicked.">Isaiah 57:21</a>), is no more to be found on the face of that earth, or near that city whose peace is as a river, and whose righteousness as the waves of the sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-18.htm" title="O that you had listened to my commandments! then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:">Isaiah 48:18</a>), and whose inhabitants are delivered from "the waves of this troublesome world."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw.</span> The usual introduction to a new vision (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>, etc.). Having described the origin and progress of evil in the world, the final overthrow of Satan and his adherents, and the judgment when every man is rewarded according to his works, the seer now completes the whole by portraying the eternal bliss of the redeemed in heaven (cf. on Revelation 20:10). The description is based upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; especially the latter, which follows the account of God and Magog, as does this. <span class="cmt_word">A new heaven and a new earth.</span> The dispute as to whether a new creation is intended, or a revivified earth, seems to be founded on the false assumption that the dwellers in heaven must be localized in space (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>, "I create new heavens and a new earth;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.</span> The Revisers follow B and others in reading <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and render it by the English perfect tense. In <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, is read <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, while other manuscripts give <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>. <span class="accented">The first heaven and earth</span>; that is, those now existing pass away as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And there was no more sea;</span> <span class="accented">and the sea no longer exists.</span> The threefold division of heaven, earth, and sea represents the whole of this world (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a>). Some interpret the <span class="accented">sea</span> symbolically of the restless, unstable, wicked nations of the earth, which now exist no longer; others understand the absence of <span class="accented">sea</span> to typify the absence of instability and wickedness in the New Jerusalem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-8 The new heaven and the new earth will not be separate from each other; the earth of the saints, their glorified, bodies, will be heavenly. The old world, with all its troubles and tumults, will have passed away. There will be no sea; this aptly represents freedom from conflicting passions, temptations, troubles, changes, and alarms; from whatever can divide or interrupt the communion of saints. This new Jerusalem is the church of God in its new and perfect state, the church triumphant. Its blessedness came wholly from God, and depends on him. The presence of God with his people in heaven, will not be interrupt as it is on earth, he will dwell with them continually. All effects of former trouble shall be done away. They have often been in tears, by reason of sin, of affliction, of the calamities of the church; but no signs, no remembrance of former sorrows shall remain. Christ makes all things new. If we are willing and desirous that the gracious Redeemer should make all things new in order hearts and nature, he will make all things new in respect of our situation, till he has brought us to enjoy complete happiness. See the certainty of the promise. God gives his titles, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, as a pledge for the full performance. Sensual and sinful pleasures are muddy and poisoned waters; and the best earthly comforts are like the scanty supplies of a cistern; when idolized, they become broken cisterns, and yield only vexation. But the joys which Christ imparts are like waters springing from a fountain, pure, refreshing, abundant, and eternal. The sanctifying consolations of the Holy Spirit prepare for heavenly happiness; they are streams which flow for us in the wilderness. The fearful durst not meet the difficulties of religion, their slavish fear came from their unbelief; but those who were so dastardly as not to dare to take up the cross of Christ, were yet so desperate as to run into abominable wickedness. The agonies and terrors of the first death will lead to the far greater terrors and agonies of eternal death.</body></html>
