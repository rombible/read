The tent, or tabernacle, is in the seer's mind. There is a difference in the prepositions used here and in Revelation 7 : in the latter, God was spoken of as tabernacling <span class= "ital">over</span> them; here He tabernacles with them. He not only stretches His cloud-shelter over them, but He is with them. <span class= "ital">They shall be His people, and He shall be God with them, their God.</span> The introduction of the words in italics ("and be") in our version is a weakness; the force of the thought is spoiled. <span class= "ital">They</span> are God's people, and He is their Emmanuel--God with them, their God. The prophet Ezekiel supplies parallel thoughts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/37-27.htm" title="My tabernacle also shall be with them: yes, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Ezekiel 37:27-28</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/26-11.htm" title="And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying.</span> <span class="accented">Out of the throne</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, and others; <span class="accented">out of heaven</span> is the reading of B, P, etc. As usual, the <span class="accented">voice</span> is described as a <span class="accented">great</span> voice (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17</a>, etc.). It is not stated from whom the voice proceeds, but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">he shall tabernacle with them.</span> Still the seer is influenced by the language of Ezekiel: "And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-28.htm">Ezekiel 37:28</a>). Thus God makes his abode in his glorified Church - the New Jerusalem, among his spiritual Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>, where this vision has been already anticipated). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God;</span> <span class="accented">and they shall be his peoples, and himself shall be God with them, their God.</span> The balance of authority is in favour of retaining the two last words, though they are omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, and others. Evidently the same words as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a> (see above), "My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people." Cf. "God with them" with "Emmanuel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). Now, the promise is redeemed in all its fulness. The plural "peoples" seems to point to the catholic nature of the New Jerusalem, which embraces many nations (cf. ver. 24; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-8 The new heaven and the new earth will not be separate from each other; the earth of the saints, their glorified, bodies, will be heavenly. The old world, with all its troubles and tumults, will have passed away. There will be no sea; this aptly represents freedom from conflicting passions, temptations, troubles, changes, and alarms; from whatever can divide or interrupt the communion of saints. This new Jerusalem is the church of God in its new and perfect state, the church triumphant. Its blessedness came wholly from God, and depends on him. The presence of God with his people in heaven, will not be interrupt as it is on earth, he will dwell with them continually. All effects of former trouble shall be done away. They have often been in tears, by reason of sin, of affliction, of the calamities of the church; but no signs, no remembrance of former sorrows shall remain. Christ makes all things new. If we are willing and desirous that the gracious Redeemer should make all things new in order hearts and nature, he will make all things new in respect of our situation, till he has brought us to enjoy complete happiness. See the certainty of the promise. God gives his titles, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, as a pledge for the full performance. Sensual and sinful pleasures are muddy and poisoned waters; and the best earthly comforts are like the scanty supplies of a cistern; when idolized, they become broken cisterns, and yield only vexation. But the joys which Christ imparts are like waters springing from a fountain, pure, refreshing, abundant, and eternal. The sanctifying consolations of the Holy Spirit prepare for heavenly happiness; they are streams which flow for us in the wilderness. The fearful durst not meet the difficulties of religion, their slavish fear came from their unbelief; but those who were so dastardly as not to dare to take up the cross of Christ, were yet so desperate as to run into abominable wickedness. The agonies and terrors of the first death will lead to the far greater terrors and agonies of eternal death.</body></html>
