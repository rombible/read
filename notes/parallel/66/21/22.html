The Lord is there--the temple, the sanctuary, the dwelling-place of His people. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm" title="It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.">Ezekiel 48:35</a>.) Every merely local aspect of worship is at an end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21-24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.</span> No <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "inner shrine," or "sanctuary" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>). The whole city is now the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. on vers. 16, 17, where the shape of the city is that of the holy of holies). The presence of God pervades all the city (cf. ver. 11); all the redeemed are within the sanctuary, all are now priests (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>). There is, therefore, no <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, or "temple," within the city, for the whole city itself is the temple. The Object of all worship and the great Sacrifice are there (Alford). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:22-27 Perfect and direct communion with God, will more than supply the place of gospel institutions. And what words can more full express the union and co-equality of the Son with the Father, in the Godhead? What a dismal world would this be, if it were not for the light of the sun! What is there in heaven that supplies its place? The glory of God lightens that city, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. God in Christ will be an everlasting Fountain of knowledge and joy to the saints in heaven. There is no night, therefore no need of shutting the gates; all is at peace and secure. The whole shows us that we should be more and more led to think of heaven as filled with the glory of God, and enlightened by the presence of the Lord Jesus. Nothing sinful or unclean, idolatrous, or false and deceitful, can enter. All the inhabitants are made perfect in holiness. Now the saints feel a sad mixture of corruption, which hinders them in the service of God, and interrupts their communion with him; but, at their entrance into the holy of holies, they are washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and presented to the Father without spot. None are admitted into heaven who work abominations. It is free from hypocrites, such as make lies. As nothing unclean can enter heaven, let us be stirred up by these glimpses of heavenly things, to use all diligence, and to perfect holiness in the fear of God.</body></html>
