These words show the reason for the words of ver. 6; and may be called the text on which the Apocalypse is based (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a>.); for, though the words themselves do not often recur, yet the spirit of them is constantly appearing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I will be his God, and he shall be my son</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>, "And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people"). Some have thought that these words prove the Speaker to be God the Father; but it is impossible to separate the Persons of the Blessed Trinity in these chapters. This promise, first made to David concerning Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>), received its mystical fulfilment in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>), and is now fulfilled in the members of Christ (Alford). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-8 The new heaven and the new earth will not be separate from each other; the earth of the saints, their glorified, bodies, will be heavenly. The old world, with all its troubles and tumults, will have passed away. There will be no sea; this aptly represents freedom from conflicting passions, temptations, troubles, changes, and alarms; from whatever can divide or interrupt the communion of saints. This new Jerusalem is the church of God in its new and perfect state, the church triumphant. Its blessedness came wholly from God, and depends on him. The presence of God with his people in heaven, will not be interrupt as it is on earth, he will dwell with them continually. All effects of former trouble shall be done away. They have often been in tears, by reason of sin, of affliction, of the calamities of the church; but no signs, no remembrance of former sorrows shall remain. Christ makes all things new. If we are willing and desirous that the gracious Redeemer should make all things new in order hearts and nature, he will make all things new in respect of our situation, till he has brought us to enjoy complete happiness. See the certainty of the promise. God gives his titles, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, as a pledge for the full performance. Sensual and sinful pleasures are muddy and poisoned waters; and the best earthly comforts are like the scanty supplies of a cistern; when idolized, they become broken cisterns, and yield only vexation. But the joys which Christ imparts are like waters springing from a fountain, pure, refreshing, abundant, and eternal. The sanctifying consolations of the Holy Spirit prepare for heavenly happiness; they are streams which flow for us in the wilderness. The fearful durst not meet the difficulties of religion, their slavish fear came from their unbelief; but those who were so dastardly as not to dare to take up the cross of Christ, were yet so desperate as to run into abominable wickedness. The agonies and terrors of the first death will lead to the far greater terrors and agonies of eternal death.</body></html>
