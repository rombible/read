The first, or former, things are passed away: <span class= "ital">death shall not be any longer; neither shall mourning, nor crying, nor pain, be any longer.</span> The splendid array of negatives come as heralds of the positive peace of the new Jerusalem: no sea, no tears, no death, no mourning, no crying, no pain; with the former things these six shadows pass away from life. "The <span class= "ital">mourning</span> is that grief which so takes possession of the whole being that it cannot be hid" (Abp. Trench). It is the same word that is rendered "wailing" in our English version (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-15.htm" title="The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,">Revelation 18:15</a>). It is used of mourning for the dead. <span class= "ital">Crying</span> is the voice of despair and dismay, as well as sorrow; it is the loud outcry which is the witness that "the times are out of joint." <span class= "ital">Pain</span> includes painful labour and weariness. With the passing away of these there must depart the ground for the often-repeated cry of "Vanity of vanities! "The sad minor of the poet's song will cease, for--<p>"Time with a gift of tears,<p>Grief with a glass that ran,"<p>together with "travail and heavy sorrow," shall be no more. On the whole passage, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm" title="He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD has spoken it.">Isaiah 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-19.htm" title="And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.">Isaiah 65:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain;</span> <span class="accented">and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more</span> (Revised Version). <span class="accented">All tears</span>; just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces;" cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-19.htm">Isaiah 65:19</a>). There is "no more death" because sin is no mere (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a>, "Sorrow and mourning shall flee away"), For the former things are passed away. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "for," should probably be omitted, as in A and P, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> as first written. <span class="accented">The former</span> state of things is the state now existing, which will then have passed away as described in ver. 1. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-8 The new heaven and the new earth will not be separate from each other; the earth of the saints, their glorified, bodies, will be heavenly. The old world, with all its troubles and tumults, will have passed away. There will be no sea; this aptly represents freedom from conflicting passions, temptations, troubles, changes, and alarms; from whatever can divide or interrupt the communion of saints. This new Jerusalem is the church of God in its new and perfect state, the church triumphant. Its blessedness came wholly from God, and depends on him. The presence of God with his people in heaven, will not be interrupt as it is on earth, he will dwell with them continually. All effects of former trouble shall be done away. They have often been in tears, by reason of sin, of affliction, of the calamities of the church; but no signs, no remembrance of former sorrows shall remain. Christ makes all things new. If we are willing and desirous that the gracious Redeemer should make all things new in order hearts and nature, he will make all things new in respect of our situation, till he has brought us to enjoy complete happiness. See the certainty of the promise. God gives his titles, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, as a pledge for the full performance. Sensual and sinful pleasures are muddy and poisoned waters; and the best earthly comforts are like the scanty supplies of a cistern; when idolized, they become broken cisterns, and yield only vexation. But the joys which Christ imparts are like waters springing from a fountain, pure, refreshing, abundant, and eternal. The sanctifying consolations of the Holy Spirit prepare for heavenly happiness; they are streams which flow for us in the wilderness. The fearful durst not meet the difficulties of religion, their slavish fear came from their unbelief; but those who were so dastardly as not to dare to take up the cross of Christ, were yet so desperate as to run into abominable wickedness. The agonies and terrors of the first death will lead to the far greater terrors and agonies of eternal death.</body></html>
