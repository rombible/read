Her robe was decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls. The Bride, the Lamb's wife, has her beautiful ornaments, richer and rarer than those which adorned the world-mistress. The comparison reminds us, in a vivid and figurative way, of our Master's often-repeated teaching. He that saveth his life, loseth it; he that loseth, saveth it; he that is content to pass by the dazzling attractions of the world, refusing splendour from the outstretched hand of Babylon, will win the true spiritual riches. There is no man that has turned away for Christ's sake from the attractions of the world-spirit, that hath forsaken houses and lands for Christ's sake and the gospel, but shall receive manifold more, &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/10-28.htm" title="Then Peter began to say to him, See, we have left all, and have followed you.">Mark 10:28-31</a>). The "jewels of right celestial worth" are part of the heritage of him who can nobly hold cheap the degrading hire of the world. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-12.htm" title="And I will make your windows of agates, and your gates of carbuncles, and all your borders of pleasant stones.">Isaiah 54:12</a>.)<p>The foundation are various. There were in the foundation of the Church diversities of gifts and administrations, but the same Lord and the same spirit. In the heavenly city we have harmony, not monotony; variety, not sameness; unity, not uniformity. The stones are not arranged in the order of the high priest's breastplate, but according to their various shades of colour, beginning from the foundation.<p>1.<span class= "ital">Jaspis, </span>dark opaque green.<p>2.<span class= "ital">Sapphirus, </span>Lapis-lazuli, opaque blue.<p>3.<span class= "ital">Chalcedon, </span>an Emerald of a greenish hue.<p>4.<span class= "ital">Smaragdus, </span>bright transparent green.<p>5.<span class= "ital">Sardonyx, </span>white and red.<p>6.<span class= "ital">Sardius, </span>bright red.<p>7.<span class= "ital">Chrysolite, </span>our Topaz, bright yellow.<p>8.<span class= "ital">Beryl, </span>bluish green.<p>9.<span class= "ital">Topazion, </span>or Peridot, yellowish green.<p>10.<span class= "ital">Chrysoprasus, </span>a darker shade of the same colour.<p>11.<span class= "ital">Hyacinthus, </span>Sapphire, sky blue.<p>12.<span class= "ital">Amethystus, </span>violet.<p>"Chrysoprasus is probably an error for Chrysopaston, a dark blue stone, studded with gold, by which substitution all the shades of blue will follow each other." (See <span class= "ital">King, On Gems.</span>)<p>With this blended harmony of colour the foundation-stones would encircle the heavenly city as with a rainbow belt. In the seer's view the light of the heavenly city would shine with hues that betoken the advent of the morning. The varying tints would glow like pledges of a dayspring from on high.<p>"Along the tingling desert of the sky,<p>Beyond the circle of the conscious hills<p>Were laid in jasper-stone as clear as glass<p>The first foundations of that new, near Day,<p>Which should be builded out of heaven to God.<p>Jasper first, I said;<p>And second, sapphire; third, chalcedony;<p>The rest in order;-last, an amethyst."<p>The foundation-stones are twelve. "As twelve, they indicate their numerical completeness (Revelation 7, 14); as shining with a common lustre, their unity; as stones of different hues, their manifoldness; as brilliant stones, the glorification of this earthly life through the light of Heaven" (Lange).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones.</span> Omit "and" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-12.htm">Isaiah 54:12</a>, "All thy borders of pleasant stones"). <span class="accented">Foundations</span> (cf. ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">The first foundation was jasper.</span> Probably the diamond (see on Revelation 4:3). <span class="cmt_word">The second, sapphire.</span> Thought to be the modern lapis lazuli.

Sometimes they sound the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation. Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.</body></html>
