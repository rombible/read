But the vision which perhaps, under all circumstances, most nearly corresponds with the present is that of Isaiah (Isaiah 6); there the prophet beheld the vision of God. His train filled the temple, and the house was filled with smoke, and a message of judgment was given to the prophet; that message declared that the sin of the people had reached a climax: they had trifled with convictions, and henceforward the words of God's servants would harden rather than awaken them. "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes," &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/6-9.htm" title="And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>), till the desolating judgments had fallen. The general drift of the present vision is similar; the days of warning are over: the plagues which now fall will fall on those who have trifled with convictions: the sanctuary which was opened as a refuge is now closed: none can enter till the plagues have descended. The time has come when the judgments of God fail to stir the conscience which has been deadened by sin; the day when the gracious influences towards repentance was felt has passed. The word that has been spoken is about to descend in judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-48.htm" title="Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?">John 7:48</a>). "Who shall not pray, with an agony of earnestness, From hardness of heart and contempt of Thy word and commandment, good Lord, deliver us?" (Dr. Vaughan).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power.</span> The "smoke" suggests <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the cloud, or Shechiuah, the symbol of God's presence and glory (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-10.htm">Exodus 16:10</a>: 24:16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sign of God's active operation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the token of judgment and calamity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-11.htm">Revelation 14:11</a>). All three significations receive their fulfilment in this place. And no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled; <span class="accented">should be finished</span> (Revised Version). Just as when God manifested his presence on Sinai the people were not allowed to approach, so here no one is allowed to approach the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the dwelling place of God, while he is manifesting his judgments. The description is intended to convey an impression of the awful sacredness of God's presence. (For the explanation of the parts of this verse, see on previous verses.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:5-8 In the judgments God executes upon antichrist and his followers, he fulfils the prophecies and promises of his word. These angels are prepared for their work, clothed with pure and white linen, their breasts girded with golden girdles, representing the holiness, and righteousness, and excellence of these dealings with men. They are ministers of Divine justice, and do every thing in a pure and holy manner. They were armed with the wrath of God against his enemies. Even the meanest creature, when armed with the anger of God, will be too hard for any man in the world. The angels received the vials from one of the four living creatures, one of the ministers of the true church, as in answer to the prayers of the ministers and people of God. Antichrist could not be destroyed without a great shock to all the world, and even the people of God would be in trouble and confusion while the great work was doing. The greatest deliverances of the church are brought about by awful and astonishing steps of Providence; and the happy state of the true church will not begin till obstinate enemies shall be destroyed, and lukewarm or formal Christians are purified. Then, whatever is against Scripture being purged away, the whole church shall be spiritual, and the whole being brought to purity, unity, and spirituality, shall be firmly established.</body></html>
