The vials are the shallow bowls which were used for incense. They are filled with the wrath of God, and that wrath is now to be poured out "upon the kingdoms that have not called upon God's name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm" title="Pour out your wrath on the heathen that have not known you, and on the kingdoms that have not called on your name.">Psalm 79:6</a>). These vials are given by one of the living creatures who represent creation; it is thus through creation that the wrath of God can visit the rebellious; that wrath of God is simply the operation of God's righteous law against sin. His statutes are eternally righteous. He has given to all things a law which cannot be broken; that law is adverse to evil, and will in the end root it out, for it does the bidding of God, who lives unto the ages of the ages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels;</span> <span class="accented">four living beings.</span> These, as representing life on the earth (see on Revelation 4:6; 5:9), are appropriately chosen as the medium for conveying to the angels the plagues about to be inflicted on men. This description is very like what is related of the cherubim - from which the idea of the living beings is evolved (see on Revelation 4:6) - in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-7.htm">Ezekiel 10:7</a>, "And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out."

(On "vials," see on Revelation 5:8, and compare with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>, "the cup of his indignation.") Compare the expression, "who liveth forever and ever," with the possible reading of ver. 3, "thou King of the ages." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:5-8 In the judgments God executes upon antichrist and his followers, he fulfils the prophecies and promises of his word. These angels are prepared for their work, clothed with pure and white linen, their breasts girded with golden girdles, representing the holiness, and righteousness, and excellence of these dealings with men. They are ministers of Divine justice, and do every thing in a pure and holy manner. They were armed with the wrath of God against his enemies. Even the meanest creature, when armed with the anger of God, will be too hard for any man in the world. The angels received the vials from one of the four living creatures, one of the ministers of the true church, as in answer to the prayers of the ministers and people of God. Antichrist could not be destroyed without a great shock to all the world, and even the people of God would be in trouble and confusion while the great work was doing. The greatest deliverances of the church are brought about by awful and astonishing steps of Providence; and the happy state of the true church will not begin till obstinate enemies shall be destroyed, and lukewarm or formal Christians are purified. Then, whatever is against Scripture being purged away, the whole church shall be spiritual, and the whole being brought to purity, unity, and spirituality, shall be firmly established.</body></html>
