St. Stephen spoke of "the tabernacle of witness" in the wilderness, which was made after the pattern showed in the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-44.htm" title="Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.">Acts 7:44</a>). The tabernacle was well called the tabernacle of witness, for it contained the ark of the testimony with the Law of God, and was a perpetual witness of God's presence among His people. The temple of the tabernacle then is the shrine, or inner sanctuary, of the heavenly true tabernacle, after the pattern of which the tabernacle of Moses was fashioned, which is now opened.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after that I looked, and, behold;</span> <span class="accented">and after these things 1 saw.</span> The characteristic commencement of a new vision or portion of a vision (see on Revelation 4:1, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.</span> The <span class="accented">tabernacle</span> had its counterpart in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16, 21</a> we have the reason of the title "tabernacle of the testimony" - a name which is common in the Bible (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-21.htm">Exodus 38:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-50.htm">Numbers 1:50, 53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>). The "temple" is the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the inner shrine, the holy of holies which contained the ark of the testimony, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>.9 is seen in connection with the judgments of God. Thence now proceed the angels bearing the plagues for men. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:5-8 In the judgments God executes upon antichrist and his followers, he fulfils the prophecies and promises of his word. These angels are prepared for their work, clothed with pure and white linen, their breasts girded with golden girdles, representing the holiness, and righteousness, and excellence of these dealings with men. They are ministers of Divine justice, and do every thing in a pure and holy manner. They were armed with the wrath of God against his enemies. Even the meanest creature, when armed with the anger of God, will be too hard for any man in the world. The angels received the vials from one of the four living creatures, one of the ministers of the true church, as in answer to the prayers of the ministers and people of God. Antichrist could not be destroyed without a great shock to all the world, and even the people of God would be in trouble and confusion while the great work was doing. The greatest deliverances of the church are brought about by awful and astonishing steps of Providence; and the happy state of the true church will not begin till obstinate enemies shall be destroyed, and lukewarm or formal Christians are purified. Then, whatever is against Scripture being purged away, the whole church shall be spiritual, and the whole being brought to purity, unity, and spirituality, shall be firmly established.</body></html>
