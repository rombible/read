The song of Moses was a paean of victory over Pharaoh and his hosts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/14-26.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.">Exodus 14:26-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-1.htm" title="Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:1-21</a>). Israel stood on the margin of the Red Sea and saw the tokens of the overthrow of the great world-power of that day; so these saints stand by the border of the fire-blent sea of glass, and sing the song of triumph over the doom of the great world-powers of every age. The cases are parallel, the songs are alike; and it would not be out of place were the words of that other song of Moses, the man of God, to be heard from those who are made glad according to the days of their affliction, and who are clothed with the beauty of the Lord their God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-15.htm" title="Make us glad according to the days wherein you have afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.">Psalm 90:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-17.htm" title="And let the beauty of the LORD our God be on us: and establish you the work of our hands on us; yes, the work of our hands establish you it.">Psalm 90:17</a>). They also sing the song of the Lamb. The Apocalypse is full of Christ; the Lamb is the axis on which the world of its scenery moves; He is the key of earth's history; the victory of the saints is in Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-11.htm" title="And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death.">Revelation 12:11</a>); their song of triumph is of Him who put a new song in their mouth and in whom all things are reconciled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<p>(3, 4) <span class= "bld">Great and marvellous are thy works. . . .</span>--The <span class= "ital">song</span> is better thus translated:--<p>"Great and marvellous are Thy works,<p>Lord God Almighty.<p>Just and true are Thy ways,<p>Thou King of the nations.<p>Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Thy name?<p>Because Thou only art holy:<p>Because all the nations shall come and worship<p>in Thy presence:<p>Because Thy judgments were manifested."<p>The works are called "great;" the "ways" are called just and true. It is not mere marvel which calls forth the song of praise, but righteousness, truth, and holiness. The Almighty is the righteous ruler. The English version has "King of saints;" the reading should be "King of <span class= "ital">the nations"</span> or else, perhaps, "King of <span class= "ital">the ages"</span> The latter reading harmonises well with the immediate context and with the other passages, which link the thought of "the ages" with the "righteous dealings" of God. "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-142.htm" title="Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and your law is the truth.">Psalm 119:142</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/119-144.htm" title="The righteousness of your testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.">Psalm 119:144, Psa_119:151-152, Psa_119:160</a>). But the former is to be preferred; it is appropriate in a song which celebrates a victory over those who vaunted themselves as the princes of this world, and which proclaims the submission of the nations to God; and it seems to have been transplanted here from Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-7.htm" title="Who would not fear you, O King of nations? for to you does it appertain: for as much as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like to you.">Jeremiah 10:7</a>): "Who would not fear thee, thou King of the nations?" The song celebrates the noble acts of the Lord; it declares them to be great; but it is not their greatness, it is their righteousness and faithfulness which calls forth the grateful praise. The long days of oppression, and the seeming silence of the Almighty, when the prayer and cry "How long?" has risen from perplexed and suffering saints, have brought the temptation of the psalmist: "I have cleansed my heart in vain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/73-3.htm" title="For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.">Psalm 73:3-13</a>). But now the righteous acts of the Lord are manifested; now it is acknowledged that "verily there is a reward for the righteous; verily He is a God that judgeth in the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-11.htm" title="So that a man shall say, Truly there is a reward for the righteous: truly he is a God that judges in the earth.">Psalm 58:11</a>). Though clouds and darkness have sometimes been round about Him, it is now beyond doubt that "righteousness and judgment are the habitation of His throne" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-2.htm" title="Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.">Psalm 97:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.</span> Most probably the song of deliverance after the passage of the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>.), to which this bears a general resemblance. Moses is called the "servant of God" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a> and elsewhere. The song of Moses is also the song of the Lamb; the Old Testament and the New Testament Churches are one. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>, "And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-2.htm">Psalm 111:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>). This song, like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>, is addressed to the "Lord God Almighty." <span class="cmt_word">Just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.</span> The reading of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "of saints," is certainly incorrect. It does not appear in any Greek manuscripts, but was inserted by Erasmus to represent the <span class="accented">sanctorum</span> of his Vulgate, which word, however, is itself a corruption <span class="accented">of saeculorum</span>, the true Vulgate reading representing <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">"of</span> nations," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, P, 1, 7, 8, 14. etc., An-dress, Primasius; while <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "of ages," is the reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, 95, Vulgate, etc. It has been conjectured that <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x399;&#x398;&#x39d;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span> (by itacism for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) has been confused with <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x399;&#x3a9;&#x39d;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span>. a parallel to the reading, " King of nations" is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-7.htm">Jeremiah 10:7</a>, Hebrew text and Theodotion, but not LXX.: "Who would not fear thee, O King of nations?" which is very like the succeeding clause in ver. 5, especially in connection with the "nations" there mentioned. The title "King of the ages," or "eternal King," is applied to God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm">1 Timothy 1:17</a>, and in the Book of Tobit twice (13:6 and 10), but seems unknown to the Old Testament. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-4 Seven angels appeared in heaven; prepared to finish the destruction of antichrist. As the measure of Babylon's sins was filled up, it finds the full measure of Divine wrath. While believers stand in this world, in times of trouble, as upon a sea of glass mingled with fire, they may look forward to their final deliverance, while new mercies call forth new hymns of praise. The more we know of God's wonderful works, the more we shall praise his greatness as the Lord God Almighty, the Creator and Ruler of all worlds; but his title of Emmanuel, the King of saints, will make him dear to us. Who that considers the power of God's wrath, the value of his favour, or the glory of his holiness, would refuse to fear and honour him alone? His praise is above heaven and earth.</body></html>
