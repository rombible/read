This sign is called "great and marvellous;" it introduces a new set of scenes; the same characters will reappear, but we must start with fresh attention.<p>The seer sees <span class= "ital">seven angels</span> (not "the seven angels;" it is perfectly needless to ask what angels, or to try and identify them with the trumpet angels) <span class= "ital">having seven plagues, the last, because in them is completed the wrath of God.</span> The statement that these are the <span class= "ital">last</span> plagues seems to show that the set of visions now commencing carry us down to the end of the age; there are no other plagues after these: they are the last plagues; the vials, like the seals and the trumpets, run up to the final consummation. They are plagues; the word carries us back to Egypt: on Egypt fell the ten plagues which showed forth God's righteous power, and exposed the hollow pretensions of the magicians and their gods; the wild beast-power and the false prophet-power of that day was crippled and exposed. In like manner upon the wild beast-power of later ages the plagues of God fall. They are plagues, because they are sent forth, not like the trumpets to warn men to repent, but upon those who have obstinately refused to return; they are not goads to the wavering, but they are strokes upon the wilful and hardened; they are directed against those who are deliberately hostile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw another sign in heaven.</span> The last time we had this expression was in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>, where the history of the war between Satan and the Church was begun. Once more we have a new departure, the seer again, as it were, returning to the beginning? in order to trace the course of the punishments inflicted on men for their worship of the devil. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15.htm">Revelation 15</a>. gives a short summary of this, which is expanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16</a>; and it is introduced, as usual, by a vision of the saints in glory, in order to comfort and support the Christian in his warfare (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1-5, 13</a>). The "sign" is what is described in the following account. "In heaven" probably merely means in a conspicuous position (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Great and marvellous.</span> On account of the terrible nature of the events depicted. <span class="cmt_word">Seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God;</span> <span class="accented">seven angels having seven plagues, the last</span> [<span class="accented">ones</span>]<span class="accented">, because in them is finished the wrath of God.</span> The seer describes what he sees subsequently, as if all the actors were present at one moment. In reality, he sees the actions of the "seven angels" in succession. The number <span class="accented">seven</span> denotes the universal, all-extending nature of the plagues (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). They are the <span class="accented">last</span> plagues, because they lead on to the description of the final fall of the power of the devil in its various forms, and to the account of the last judgment of God and the eternal bliss of the saints in glory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-4 Seven angels appeared in heaven; prepared to finish the destruction of antichrist. As the measure of Babylon's sins was filled up, it finds the full measure of Divine wrath. While believers stand in this world, in times of trouble, as upon a sea of glass mingled with fire, they may look forward to their final deliverance, while new mercies call forth new hymns of praise. The more we know of God's wonderful works, the more we shall praise his greatness as the Lord God Almighty, the Creator and Ruler of all worlds; but his title of Emmanuel, the King of saints, will make him dear to us. Who that considers the power of God's wrath, the value of his favour, or the glory of his holiness, would refuse to fear and honour him alone? His praise is above heaven and earth.</body></html>
