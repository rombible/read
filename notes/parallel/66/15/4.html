(the word "Thee" should be omitted, <span class= "ital">because Thou art holy.</span> The word rendered "holy" is not that which is usually employed when the holiness of God is spoken of; it is a word which, when applied to men, denotes one who reverences the sacred obligations of natural and moral order, apart from the thought of mere law or custom. The word is applied here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5</a>, to God, and denotes the recognition of those sacred obligations which the character of God, if I may say so with reverence, imposes upon Himself. It is the remembrance that God will, as Judge of all the earth, do right, and will vindicate the expectations of those who stay themselves upon His character, which generates a holy fear of Him.<p><span class= "bld">All nations shall come and worship . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">All the nations worship, because Thy judgments</span> (or, <span class= "ital">righteous acts</span>)<span class= "ital"> are manifested.</span> The song is one in anticipation. The angels of judgment are going forth; the righteous dealings of God will be seen; but these things are spoken of as though accomplished: their completion is a divine certainty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy Name? Omit "thee." The latter part is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-7.htm">Jeremiah 10:7</a> (see on ver. 3). The former part contains the same idea as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-6.htm">Jeremiah 10:6</a>, "Thy Name is great in might." Compare the similar ascription of praise to the beast in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a>. The following three clauses supply the reasons for thus fearing and glorifying God. <span class="cmt_word">For thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest;</span> <span class="accented">for thy righteous acts have been made manifest</span> (Revised Version). "Holy" is <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It is a word which is applied more particularly to human acts. Perhaps it is used here in connection with the manifest justice of God's acts before all nations; cf. the song of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>), "Who is like thee, glorious in holiness," etc.? The three clauses supply the reason for fearing and glorifying God, as mentioned in the first part of the verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> He himself is in his nature holy; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his sway extends over all nations; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the righteousness of his acts is now visible to all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Afford adds, "Thy deeds of righteousness acted out towards the nations, both in the publication of the gospel and in the destruction of thine enemies." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-4 Seven angels appeared in heaven; prepared to finish the destruction of antichrist. As the measure of Babylon's sins was filled up, it finds the full measure of Divine wrath. While believers stand in this world, in times of trouble, as upon a sea of glass mingled with fire, they may look forward to their final deliverance, while new mercies call forth new hymns of praise. The more we know of God's wonderful works, the more we shall praise his greatness as the Lord God Almighty, the Creator and Ruler of all worlds; but his title of Emmanuel, the King of saints, will make him dear to us. Who that considers the power of God's wrath, the value of his favour, or the glory of his holiness, would refuse to fear and honour him alone? His praise is above heaven and earth.</body></html>
