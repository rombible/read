It is well to remember this, for these plagues are not, like the judgments of the trumpet, calls to repentance; they are plagues on those who have refused to return, who have rejected the sanctuary, the tabernacle of witness, which the Lord pitched among men, and who have refused, like obstinate builders, the stone which has become the head of the corner. Out of the rejected temple the angels of wrath come; it is ever true that out of rejected mercies the heaviest of plagues are forged. The angels are clad in a garb resembling that of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13</a>); they are come forth to do His bidding; they are clothed in raiment which indicates their righteous errand. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm" title="And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.">Revelation 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm" title="And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-30.htm" title="And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,">Acts 10:30</a>.) Instead of <span class= "ital">linen, </span>some MSS. have "a stone<span class= "ital">:"</span> the angels, according to this, were "clad in a stone, pure, brilliant." There is a parallel thought in Ezekiel, who describes the splendour of the King of Tyre: "Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond," &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm" title="You have been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that you were created.">Ezekiel 28:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues;</span> <span class="accented">there came out the seven angels that had</span>, etc. These angels are distinguished from the other angels only by the fact that they bore the seven plagues. These they have not yet, but they receive them directly after. The phrase is added here to distinguish the angels meant. These angels have once before (ver. 1) been described in the same manner. <span class="cmt_word">Clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "linen," is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, P, 7, 14, 97, Andreas, Primasius. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, [precious] "stone," is read in A, C, 38 (margin), 48, 90, Vulgate. It seems more probable that <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the correct word; for in no other place in the New Testament is <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> found except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-20.htm">Matthew 12:20</a>, where it signifies "flax;" while the ordinary word for linen, viz. <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12, 16</a>, and Revelation 19:8, 14, as well as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>. If <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> be the correct reading, the image is perhaps suggested by the priestly garments (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>, and <span class="accented">vide infra</span>). For the idea of "clothed in precious stone," the LXX. reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a> is usually quoted. We may refer also to the stones of the high priest's breastplate, and to the description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>. <span class="accented">And having their breasts girded with golden girdles</span> (cf. the vision of our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, and the priestly attire described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-8.htm">Exodus 28:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:5-8 In the judgments God executes upon antichrist and his followers, he fulfils the prophecies and promises of his word. These angels are prepared for their work, clothed with pure and white linen, their breasts girded with golden girdles, representing the holiness, and righteousness, and excellence of these dealings with men. They are ministers of Divine justice, and do every thing in a pure and holy manner. They were armed with the wrath of God against his enemies. Even the meanest creature, when armed with the anger of God, will be too hard for any man in the world. The angels received the vials from one of the four living creatures, one of the ministers of the true church, as in answer to the prayers of the ministers and people of God. Antichrist could not be destroyed without a great shock to all the world, and even the people of God would be in trouble and confusion while the great work was doing. The greatest deliverances of the church are brought about by awful and astonishing steps of Providence; and the happy state of the true church will not begin till obstinate enemies shall be destroyed, and lukewarm or formal Christians are purified. Then, whatever is against Scripture being purged away, the whole church shall be spiritual, and the whole being brought to purity, unity, and spirituality, shall be firmly established.</body></html>
