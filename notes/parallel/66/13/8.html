A stronger tie binds them to a better allegiance; their names are in the Lamb's Book of Life. There is some doubt about the connection of the words "from the foundation of the world." Some connect them with the word "written": this would express that the names were written "from the foundation of the world" in the book. Others connect them with the word "slain": this expresses that the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world. For the former view, the similar passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a> is cited; but, on the other hand, the phrase "from the foundation of the world" is connected in other parts of the Bible with certain aspects of the work of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19-20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>), and it seems more natural to take the words in their simple order. Whatever view we take, the verse proclaims that the security of God's saints is based on the eternal love of God. "An eternal deliverer is the only refuge from this great world-tyranny; "the strength of the tempted is in Him who is the same in love and righteousness through all the ages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb</span>; [<span class="accented">every</span> one] <span class="accented">whose name hath not been written</span>, as in the Revised Version. "Him," <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, masculine, although referring to the neuter, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, because the personality of Satan under the figure of the beast is borne in mind. "Whose name," singular, referring to the individuals of whom the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "all," are composed. This verse states in another form what has been related in the latter part of the preceding verse. Those over whom the beast has authority are those who worship him, and whose names have not "been written in the book of life." The expression, "book of life," is found only in this book and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>. In all the places where it occurs it seems to refer primarily to Christians (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-19.htm">Revelation 22:19</a>). At baptism the Christian's name is written in the "book of life," from which there is always a possibility of it being blotted out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>). Those who are not Christians have not their name in the "book of life," but <span class="accented">worship</span> the beast, that is, pay allegiance to him. It is "the book of life of the Lamb," because it is through "the Lamb" that there exists a "book of life" for men. <span class="cmt_word">Slain from the foundation of the world;</span> or, <span class="accented">that hath been slain.</span> It is natural to connect the words, "from the foundation of the world," with "slain," and not with "written." The latter course has been followed by Bengel, Dusterdieck, De Wette, Ewald, Hengstenberg, and others, and in the margin of the Revised Version, and is in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>, "Whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). "The Lamb hath been slain from the foundation of the world," because from "the foundation of the world" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>) his death has been efficacious for the salvation of men; and because his death "was foreordained before the foundation of the world," although manifest only in the last times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>). What was foreknown to and ordained by God is spoken of as having taken place. This latter sense must be the meaning if we adopt the alternative reading. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 The apostle, standing on the shore, saw a savage beast rise out of the sea; a tyrannical, idolatrous, persecuting power, springing up out of the troubles which took place. It was a frightful monster! It appears to mean that worldly, oppressing dominion, which for many ages, even from the times of the Babylonish captivity, had been hostile to the church. The first beast then began to oppress and persecute the righteous for righteousness' sake, but they suffered most under the fourth beast of Daniel, (the Roman empire,) which has afflicted the saints with many cruel persecutions. The source of its power was the dragon. It was set up by the devil, and supported by him. The wounding the head may be the abolishing pagan idolatry; and the healing of the wound, introducing popish idolatry, the same in substance, only in a new dress, but which as effectually answers the devil's design. The world admired its power, policy and success. They paid honour and subjection to the devil and his instruments. It exercised infernal power and policy, requiring men to render that honour to creatures which belongs to God alone. Yet the devil's power and success are limited. Christ has a chosen remnant, redeemed by his blood, recorded in his book, sealed by his Spirit; and though the devil and antichrist may overcome the body, and take away the natural life, they cannot conquer the soul, nor prevail with true believers to forsake their Saviour, and join his enemies. Perseverance in the faith of the gospel and true worship of God, in this great hour of trial and temptation, which would deceive all but the elect, is the character of those registered in the book of life. This powerful motive and encouragement to constancy, is the great design of the whole Revelation.</body></html>
