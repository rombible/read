In Daniel's vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-4.htm" title="The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand on the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.">Daniel 7:4</a>) the kingdoms were described: the first, like a lion; the second, like a bear; the third, like a leopard or panther. Here all these features are combined, because the wild beast is a representative of all forms of world-power, which have been swift to shed blood: like a leopard leaping on the prey, tenacious and relentless as a bear, and all devouring (their throat is an open sepulchre) as a lion. The reader will remember the wild beasts which in vision hindered Dante when he sought to ascend the "pleasant mount"--the "cause and source of all delight." The leopard, the lion, the wolf were symbols of luxuriousness, cruel ambition, and hungry and heartless avarice, which oppose men and nations when they seek the Holy Hill, where the light of God ever rests. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Inferno, </span>i. 10-74)<p><span class= "bld">And the dragon.</span>--Read, <span class= "ital">And the dragon gave him his power and his throne</span> (not his "seat," as in the English version; it is the royal seat, the throne, which is meant). (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-16.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,">Revelation 11:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And great authority.</span>--It is through this succession of world-powers that the dragon carries on his war. The wild beast becomes the vicegerent, so to speak, of the prince of this world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion.</span> The similarity to the vision of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. is very evident; the resemblance extending even to the language, which is here very like the LXX. version of Daniel. Cf. especially the form <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (found in all the best manuscripts) with that of the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>. In the vision of Daniel four beasts are seen rising from the sea. The first was like a <span class="accented">lion</span>, the second like a <span class="accented">bear</span>, the third like a <span class="accented">leopard</span>, the fourth was distinguished by the <span class="accented">ten horns.</span> Here the four are combined in the one appearance of the beast. The qualities which are indicated by the animals named are very generally agreed upon. The <span class="accented">lion</span> denotes lordly dominion and rule; the <span class="accented">bear</span> suggests crushing force and tenacity of purpose; the <span class="accented">leopard</span> is distinguished for its swiftness and cruel blood thirstiness. These characteristics marked the Roman empire at the time of this vision, and this probably was the first fulfilment of the vision. The same qualities have, however, been exhibited at all times by the persecutors of the Church of God, and thus the application may be extended, and the vision represents (as Alford says) "not the Roman empire merely, but the aggregate of the empires of this world as opposed to Christ and his kingdom." <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority;</span> <span class="accented">and his throne.</span> The dragon and this beast are essentially one, since the latter wields all the influence of the former. The devil lost his throne in heaven; through the power of the world he temporarily regains a throne as the "prince of this world." Christ, by his incarnation, destroyed much of the personal nature of the devil's influence over men. By that the devil was completely bound as regards the righteous (cf. the interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>); but his power to work mischief he transfers to the nations of the world, who become his instrument for that purpose. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 The apostle, standing on the shore, saw a savage beast rise out of the sea; a tyrannical, idolatrous, persecuting power, springing up out of the troubles which took place. It was a frightful monster! It appears to mean that worldly, oppressing dominion, which for many ages, even from the times of the Babylonish captivity, had been hostile to the church. The first beast then began to oppress and persecute the righteous for righteousness' sake, but they suffered most under the fourth beast of Daniel, (the Roman empire,) which has afflicted the saints with many cruel persecutions. The source of its power was the dragon. It was set up by the devil, and supported by him. The wounding the head may be the abolishing pagan idolatry; and the healing of the wound, introducing popish idolatry, the same in substance, only in a new dress, but which as effectually answers the devil's design. The world admired its power, policy and success. They paid honour and subjection to the devil and his instruments. It exercised infernal power and policy, requiring men to render that honour to creatures which belongs to God alone. Yet the devil's power and success are limited. Christ has a chosen remnant, redeemed by his blood, recorded in his book, sealed by his Spirit; and though the devil and antichrist may overcome the body, and take away the natural life, they cannot conquer the soul, nor prevail with true believers to forsake their Saviour, and join his enemies. Perseverance in the faith of the gospel and true worship of God, in this great hour of trial and temptation, which would deceive all but the elect, is the character of those registered in the book of life. This powerful motive and encouragement to constancy, is the great design of the whole Revelation.</body></html>
