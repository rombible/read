The devil had sought to beguile Christ by offering to him all the kingdoms of the world. His efforts with men are more successful. They worship him on account of the worldly wealth and influence which he bestows. <span class="cmt_word">And they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?</span> Insert "and" with Revised Version: and <span class="accented">who is able</span>, etc.? The beast usurps the homage due to God alone (cf. the song of those who had triumphed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>, "Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy Name?" cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>, etc.). The adherents of the beast thus intimate their belief in his superior prowess and his ability to succeed in his war against those who "keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 The apostle, standing on the shore, saw a savage beast rise out of the sea; a tyrannical, idolatrous, persecuting power, springing up out of the troubles which took place. It was a frightful monster! It appears to mean that worldly, oppressing dominion, which for many ages, even from the times of the Babylonish captivity, had been hostile to the church. The first beast then began to oppress and persecute the righteous for righteousness' sake, but they suffered most under the fourth beast of Daniel, (the Roman empire,) which has afflicted the saints with many cruel persecutions. The source of its power was the dragon. It was set up by the devil, and supported by him. The wounding the head may be the abolishing pagan idolatry; and the healing of the wound, introducing popish idolatry, the same in substance, only in a new dress, but which as effectually answers the devil's design. The world admired its power, policy and success. They paid honour and subjection to the devil and his instruments. It exercised infernal power and policy, requiring men to render that honour to creatures which belongs to God alone. Yet the devil's power and success are limited. Christ has a chosen remnant, redeemed by his blood, recorded in his book, sealed by his Spirit; and though the devil and antichrist may overcome the body, and take away the natural life, they cannot conquer the soul, nor prevail with true believers to forsake their Saviour, and join his enemies. Perseverance in the faith of the gospel and true worship of God, in this great hour of trial and temptation, which would deceive all but the elect, is the character of those registered in the book of life. This powerful motive and encouragement to constancy, is the great design of the whole Revelation.</body></html>
