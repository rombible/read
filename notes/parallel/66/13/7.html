And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, "The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them [the two witnesses], and shall overcome them, and kill them." <span class="accented">Overcome</span>; that is, apparently; so far as is seen by the world. In the same way the world overcame Christ; but by his death came victory. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> the Church at Smyrna is encouraged by the words, "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer... be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." And power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations; <span class="accented">over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> "people," is inserted in every manuscript except a few cursives. The fourfold enumeration, applied to the earth, denotes the universal character of the description (cf. the four living beings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>. Also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-9.htm">Revelation 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>). The same classification is adopted in the song of the redeemed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>), which may be contrasted with this passage. Although the power of Satan extends to every section of the nations of the earth, yet men are not irrevocably delivered into his hand. From every part of mankind men are also redeemed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 The apostle, standing on the shore, saw a savage beast rise out of the sea; a tyrannical, idolatrous, persecuting power, springing up out of the troubles which took place. It was a frightful monster! It appears to mean that worldly, oppressing dominion, which for many ages, even from the times of the Babylonish captivity, had been hostile to the church. The first beast then began to oppress and persecute the righteous for righteousness' sake, but they suffered most under the fourth beast of Daniel, (the Roman empire,) which has afflicted the saints with many cruel persecutions. The source of its power was the dragon. It was set up by the devil, and supported by him. The wounding the head may be the abolishing pagan idolatry; and the healing of the wound, introducing popish idolatry, the same in substance, only in a new dress, but which as effectually answers the devil's design. The world admired its power, policy and success. They paid honour and subjection to the devil and his instruments. It exercised infernal power and policy, requiring men to render that honour to creatures which belongs to God alone. Yet the devil's power and success are limited. Christ has a chosen remnant, redeemed by his blood, recorded in his book, sealed by his Spirit; and though the devil and antichrist may overcome the body, and take away the natural life, they cannot conquer the soul, nor prevail with true believers to forsake their Saviour, and join his enemies. Perseverance in the faith of the gospel and true worship of God, in this great hour of trial and temptation, which would deceive all but the elect, is the character of those registered in the book of life. This powerful motive and encouragement to constancy, is the great design of the whole Revelation.</body></html>
