Wisdom--indeed, the highest wisdom--is needed for those who would understand it. Two or three points ought to be noticed. (1) The verse surely implies that the understanding of this name and number is attainable; it warns us that <span class= "ital">wisdom</span> and <span class= "ital">understanding</span> are needed, but it as certainly leads us to believe that to wisdom and understanding a solution of the problem will be granted. (2) There is a variation in the MSS. respecting the number. Some MSS. read six hundred and sixteen; but the probability is in favour of the reading six hundred and sixty-six. In an excursus (<span class= "ital">Excursus B</span>) will be found a short account of the various interpretations which have been given. (3) The clause "It is the number of a man," has been rendered "For number is of man." The number, then, is the combination of three sixes; there is a wisdom and understanding which may grasp its import, and that import is to be guided by the principle that it is the number of a man, or that number is of man--is, that is to say, a method of computation which is used by man, and used by God in order to symbolise something made thus more intelligible to man. Is the wisdom which is to solve this, then, the mere cleverness which can guess an acrostic or an enigma? or is it rather that the true heavenly wisdom, which is moral rather than intellectual, is needed to unite itself with understanding to solve the problem? Surely the dignity of the Apocalypse is sacrificed when we search for its meaning like children playing with conundrums rather than like men being guided by its principles. There is a wisdom which brings its sevenfold beam of heavenly light to the children of men--a wisdom pure, peaceable, gentle, full of mercy, without partiality, without hypocrisy--and when this wisdom rests on men in the fulness of its seven-fold perfection they may read the number of the beast, and see that, with all its vaunted strength, it is but weak; with all its vaunted perfection, it is imperfect; that though it vaunts itself as rich, increased in goods and needing nothing, it still lacks that "one needful thing"--faith in God, or the love by which faith works. Without this it will never attain even the appearance of that perfect heavenly number symbolised by seven; it may multiply itself in earthly strength--the power of worldliness into the power of worldly wisdom, and this again by the power of a hundred-fold satanic subtlety--but it will remain still short of the tokens of the kingdom of God; and the number when read will be, however godlike it looks, but the number of a man after all.<p>I am disposed, therefore, to interpret this "six hundred and sixty-six" as a symbolical number, expressing all that it is possible for human wisdom, and human power, when directed by an evil spirit, to achieve, and indicating a state of marvellous earthly perfection, when the beast-power has reached its highest development, when culture, civilisation, art, song, science and reason have combined to produce an age so nearly resembling perfection--an age of gold, if not a golden age--that men will begin to say that faith in God is an impertinence, and the hope of a future life a libel upon the happiness of the present. Then will the world-power have reached the zenith of his influence; then will only a wisdom descended from above be able to detect the infinite difference between a world with faith and a world without faith, and the great gulf which the want of a little heaven-born love can fix between an age and an age.<p>At the same time, I feel bound to place here, as well as in the <span class= "ital">Excursus, </span>two other views--one because it has recently been advanced with conspicuous ability; the other because it is perhaps the most generally adopted, as it is certainly the most ancient, view. Both these interpretations are based upon the theory that the letters of the name, when added together, according to their numerical value, will make up six hundred and sixty-six. The first of these alluded to finds the word in Nero Caesar. The second, and more ancient, finds it in Lateinos: this last was mentioned by Irenaeus. It will be seen that both these solutions are at one in making the number point to the great Roman Power; and this was the great embodiment of the terrible spirit of self-sufficiency, tyranny, and utter godless worldliness with which St. John was familiar. These interpretations are interpretations in example, and as such probably true; but they are only types, as it seems to me, of that fuller and deeper view which takes the number as symbolical of that power which, whether directed by Nero, or inspired by Emperor or Pope, or false teacher, or military tyrant, has dazzled mankind by a fictitious glory, a fictitious civilisation, and a fictitious religion, or deceived them by holding out the promise of splendour and happiness without the knowledge and obedience of God, without law, without faith, and therefore without true joy.

Note of the "Three Frogs," <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/16-13.htm" title="And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.">Revelation 16:13-14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Here is wisdom, Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man.</span> The last clause has no article, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>. Compare the expression, "Here is the patience," etc. in ver. 10, where it relates to what precedes. Here it evidently refers to what follows. The form of expression is frequent in St. John's writings (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>, etc.). The plain meaning seems to be that men may display their wisdom and understanding in discovering the meaning of the number of the beast. But the interpretation which Auberlen gives may be correct; viz. that as the first beast is met and vanquished by patience and faith, so this second beast is to be met by <span class="accented">wisdom.</span> This agrees with our interpretation of this second beast as symbolizing self deceit. St. John evidently intends that the meaning of the number should be known: "Let him that hath understanding count the number;" that is, "Let him that hath understanding discern in what sense the symbol is used." It is the "number of man;" that is, it describes symbolically something which is peculiarly a characteristic of mankind. Some writers have understood the words to mean, "the number refers to an individual man;" but the absence of the article militates against this view. Others explain, "It is a number which is to be reckoned according to man's mode of reckoning," just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-17.htm">Revelation 21:17</a>, "a measure of a man." If this be the meaning, it leaves open the question as to what St. John meant by "the usual mode of man's reckoning." His own use of numerals throughout the Apocalypse is, as we have repeatedly seen, symbolical of general qualities, and does not indicate either individuals or exact numbers. We are justified, therefore, according to this view, in interpreting the number symbolically (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">.<span class="cmt_word"></span> And his number is Six hundred three score and six.</span> The Revised Version is better, <span class="accented">Six hundred and sixty and six</span>; it preserves the similarity of form which is found in the Greek words, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3be;</span>, as found in A. In <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc.; in P, Andreas, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. The shortened form <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3be;&#x3c2;</span>' is found in B and most cursives. C, 11, and some manuscripts known to Irenaeus and Tichonius differ by reading <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3be;</span>, "six hundred and sixteen," but this is probably incorrect. Commentators have universally attempted to discover the name denoted by this number, by attaching to each letter of the name (generally the Greek letters) its numerical value, the total of which should equal the number 666. To this method there are several objections. In the first place, St. John nowhere else makes such use of a number, though numbers form a prominent feature of the book. In the second place, the adoption of this method seems to have been a consequence upon the interpretation of the words, "number of a man," as meaning "a number to be calculated according to man's methods." But this may not be the meaning at all (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>); and, if it is, "man's method" would surely signify the symbolical method which St. John adopts all through the rest of the book, as being a language perfectly well understood by himself and his readers. And thirdly, this numerical method has proved entirely unsatisfactory in the hands of those who have hitherto adopted it. For a complete <span class="accented">expose</span> of the fallaciousness of such attempts, we may refer the reader to Dr. Salmon's 'Introduction to the New Testament,' p. 291, <span class="accented">et seq.</span> A commonly received interpretation makes the name of the beast to be Nero Caesar, written in the Hebrew characters <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5e1;&#x5e8;</span>; and as the name may be written <span class="accented">Neron</span> or <span class="accented">Nero</span>, the difference of the final <span class="accented">n</span> ( = 50) is thought to account for the discrepancy in the manuscript authorities. Dr. Salmon shows that Nero could not have been intended, because (1)the prophecy in that ease would have been immediately falsified; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the solution would have been known to the early Christians; but it was <span class="accented">not</span> known, according to Irenaeus. Dr. Salmon then adds (p. 300), "Pages might be filled with a list of persons whose names have been proposed as solutions of the problem. Among the persons supposed to be indicated are the emperors Caligula, Trajan, and Julian the Apostate, Genseric the Vandal, Popes Benedict IX. and Paul V., Mahomet, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Beza, and Napoleon Bonaparte. There are three rules by the help of which I believe an ingenious man could find the required sum in any given name. First, if the proper name by itself will not yield it, add a title; secondly, if the sum cannot be found in Greek, try Hebrew, or even Latin; thirdly, do not be too particular about the spelling." The above objections also hold good very generally with regard to the suggestion of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, by which may be indicated the Roman or Latin power, either pagan or papal. But if we attempt to interpret this number in the same way as we have dealt with all other numbers in the Apocalypse, viz. by regarding them as symbolical of qualities, we shall be on surer ground. In the first place, the number <span class="accented">six</span> is typical of what is earthly as opposed to what is heavenly. As seven is the number of perfection, and is descriptive of universality, and is therefore the symbol pertaining to God, so six is a type of what falls short of the heavenly ideal. Cf. the <span class="accented">six</span> days of the creation; the <span class="accented">six</span> years of servitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>, etc.) and of work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-10.htm">Exodus 23:10</a>). Again, the threefold employment of the number <span class="accented">six</span>, while emphasizing the fact of the number referring to what is essentially earthly, has a fulness, importance, and seeming completeness which makes it a type of that which appears to be perfect, but in reality falls short of perfection. It is, in short, symbolical of a deceit, a sham. It is therefore descriptive of the nature of the second beast; of that self deceit which causes men to accept the world as a substitute for God, or, at least, as not antagonistic to him; which enables men to thus quiet their consciences, while in reality becoming followers of the worldly power and subjects of Satan. That this is the meaning of the number <span class="accented">six</span> is recognized by some writers, though they do not here so apply it. In the 'Speaker's Commentary,' Introduction, &sect; 11 (<span class="accented">a</span>), we find, "Six is the 'signature' of non-perfection;" and, "This number is also a symbol of <span class="accented">human rule and power."</span> Wordsworth says, "The numerical symbol of the beast, 666, indicates that he aims at and aspires to the attributes of Christ, and puts forth a semblance of Christian truth, but falls away from it in a triple decline and degeneracy." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:11-18 Those who understand the first beast to denote a worldly power, take the second to be also a persecuting and assumed power, which acts under the disguise of religion, and of charity to the souls of men. It is a spiritual dominion, professing to be derived from Christ, and exercised at first in a gentle manner, but soon spake like the dragon. Its speech betrayed it; for it gives forth those false doctrines and cruel decrees, which show it to belong to the dragon, and not to the Lamb. It exercised all the power of the former beast. It pursues the same design, to draw men from worshipping the true God, and to subject the souls of men to the will and control of men. The second beast has carried on its designs, by methods whereby men should be deceived to worship the former beast, in the new shape, or likeness made for it. By lying wonders, pretended miracles. And by severe censures. Also by allowing none to enjoy natural or civil rights, who will not worship that beast which is the image of the pagan beast. It is made a qualification for buying and selling, as well as for places of profit and trust, that they oblige themselves to use all their interest, power, and endeavour, to forward the dominion of the beast, which is meant by receiving his mark. To make an image to the beast, whose deadly wound was healed, would be to give form and power to his worship, or to require obedience to his commands. To worship the image of the beast, implies being subject to those things which stamp the character of the picture, and render it the image of the beast. The number of the beast is given, so as to show the infinite wisdom of God, and to exercise the wisdom of men. The number is the number of a man, computed after the usual manner among men, and it is 666. What or who is intended by this, remains a mystery. To almost every religious dispute this number has yet been applied, and it may reasonably be doubted whether the meaning has yet been discovered. But he who has wisdom and understanding, will see that all the enemies of God are numbered and marked out for destruction; that the term of their power will soon expire, and that all nations shall submit to our King of righteousness and peace.</body></html>
