So the horn which sprang from the fourth beast of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a> had given to it "a mouth speaking great things." The power of the beast is, after all, only held by the consent of God, who for his own good purpose permits him to exercise it for a time. The "great things" are the promises of superior power and good, with which the devil seeks to allure men, as he did Adam and Eve at the first. All attempts to decry God's omnipotence and the power of Christ are <span class="accented">blasphemies. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And power was given unto him to continue forty</span> <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">two months;</span> or, <span class="accented">to work forty and two months.</span> Again note the power is given to him; that is, he holds it only subject to the will of God. The "forty and two months," or three years and a half, signify the period of the world's existence. (For a full discussion of the subject, see on Revelation 11:2.) It is the "little time" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10, 11</a>, during which will be fulfilled the number of the saints. It is the "little season" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>, during which Satan is "loosed," that is, during which he has this power to work given to him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>). The different readings in this passage, though resting on insufficient authority, serve to amplify the meaning. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> reads <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "to do what he willeth." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "to wage war," is found in 13 and others, and is the marginal reading of the Authorized Version, but is rightly omitted in the Revised Version. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 The apostle, standing on the shore, saw a savage beast rise out of the sea; a tyrannical, idolatrous, persecuting power, springing up out of the troubles which took place. It was a frightful monster! It appears to mean that worldly, oppressing dominion, which for many ages, even from the times of the Babylonish captivity, had been hostile to the church. The first beast then began to oppress and persecute the righteous for righteousness' sake, but they suffered most under the fourth beast of Daniel, (the Roman empire,) which has afflicted the saints with many cruel persecutions. The source of its power was the dragon. It was set up by the devil, and supported by him. The wounding the head may be the abolishing pagan idolatry; and the healing of the wound, introducing popish idolatry, the same in substance, only in a new dress, but which as effectually answers the devil's design. The world admired its power, policy and success. They paid honour and subjection to the devil and his instruments. It exercised infernal power and policy, requiring men to render that honour to creatures which belongs to God alone. Yet the devil's power and success are limited. Christ has a chosen remnant, redeemed by his blood, recorded in his book, sealed by his Spirit; and though the devil and antichrist may overcome the body, and take away the natural life, they cannot conquer the soul, nor prevail with true believers to forsake their Saviour, and join his enemies. Perseverance in the faith of the gospel and true worship of God, in this great hour of trial and temptation, which would deceive all but the elect, is the character of those registered in the book of life. This powerful motive and encouragement to constancy, is the great design of the whole Revelation.</body></html>
