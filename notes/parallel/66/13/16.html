From meta and ops; the forehead.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16, 17) <span class= "bld">And he</span> <span class= "bld">causeth . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And he [i.e., </span>probably, the second wild beast, and not the image, as in the latter clause of the last verse] <span class= "ital">makes all men, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves, that they should give them a mark upon their right hand or upon their forehead: </span>(<span class= "ital">and</span>)<span class= "ital"> that no one should be able to buy or to sell but he who has the mark, the name of the wild beast, or the number of his name.</span> We have read of the sealing of the servants of God in their foreheads (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3</a>): we shall hear of it again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm" title="And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.">Revelation 22:4</a>); the power of evil also has its mark or stamp. As slaves received a brand or mark in their flesh, betokening to whom they belonged, so in the spiritual conflict there is on the side of good and of evil a brand or mark. St. Paul spoke of such marks in his own body that proved him a slave of Jesus Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-17.htm" title="From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.">Galatians 6:17</a>). In the same way the subtle false prophet, the abettor of world-power, seeks to impress a mark on all, on the penalty of complete social exclusion. It is utterly unnecessary to take this brand of evil literally, any more than we took the seal of Christ literally. That seal we understood as spiritual, in the faith and in the character; this evil brand we must interpret in like manner. It surely means the acquiescence in character and action to the principles of this tyrannical world-power: the right hand is the symbol of toil and social intercourse; the forehead is the symbol of character, as time is ever writing its awful tale upon men's brows. There have been days when men's faith has been read only too plainly by a hostile world, and when their simple trust in Christ caused Christians to be suspected, and when "men cast out their name as evil," and when the mark of the beast was worn and gloried in everywhere. We might cite from the history of the past numberless such epochs. But are we sure that the days are gone? Are we sure that it is easy for simple, unaffected goodness and genuine faith to gain all it might gain? Are we sure that honesty, guilelessness, utter and strenuous truthfulness are not weighted in the race of life? The days of the future may bring intenser forms of this tyranny, as the days of the past have shown them; but the days of the present may afford us illustrations of how readily men may lose, lose much and lose terribly, rather than succumb to fashions which violate honour and dishonour Christ. But we read of more than a mark here: we read of a "name," and the "number of a name." What are we to understand by these?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads;</span> <span class="accented">that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, "he may give," found in the Textus Receptus, is unsupported by any uncial; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "they may give," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P; and most cursives have either <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Wordsworth translates, "give to themselves," and adds, "a remarkable sentence, intimating <span class="accented">compulsion</span> under the semblance of <span class="accented">choice."</span> But it does not seem fair to press the meaning so far. The third plural is often used in a perfectly general way in the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a>, and Moulton's Winer, p. 655), and the Revised Version is probably correct in translating by the passive (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). Certainly the other passages in the Apocalypse, where the <span class="accented">mark</span> is mentioned, seem to show that men have absolute freedom of choice (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-9.htm">Revelation 14:9</a> and Revelation 20:4). Again the beast seeks to imitate God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, "I will write upon him my new name;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>, "His name shall be in their foreheads;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>). The idea is taken kern the Mosaic customs (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, "And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontiers between thine eyes") Some writers see also an allusion to the heathen custom of branding slaves and others who were devoted to the service of temples; and recall the fact that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, or "cuttings," such as are here mentioned, were forbidden to the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:11-18 Those who understand the first beast to denote a worldly power, take the second to be also a persecuting and assumed power, which acts under the disguise of religion, and of charity to the souls of men. It is a spiritual dominion, professing to be derived from Christ, and exercised at first in a gentle manner, but soon spake like the dragon. Its speech betrayed it; for it gives forth those false doctrines and cruel decrees, which show it to belong to the dragon, and not to the Lamb. It exercised all the power of the former beast. It pursues the same design, to draw men from worshipping the true God, and to subject the souls of men to the will and control of men. The second beast has carried on its designs, by methods whereby men should be deceived to worship the former beast, in the new shape, or likeness made for it. By lying wonders, pretended miracles. And by severe censures. Also by allowing none to enjoy natural or civil rights, who will not worship that beast which is the image of the pagan beast. It is made a qualification for buying and selling, as well as for places of profit and trust, that they oblige themselves to use all their interest, power, and endeavour, to forward the dominion of the beast, which is meant by receiving his mark. To make an image to the beast, whose deadly wound was healed, would be to give form and power to his worship, or to require obedience to his commands. To worship the image of the beast, implies being subject to those things which stamp the character of the picture, and render it the image of the beast. The number of the beast is given, so as to show the infinite wisdom of God, and to exercise the wisdom of men. The number is the number of a man, computed after the usual manner among men, and it is 666. What or who is intended by this, remains a mystery. To almost every religious dispute this number has yet been applied, and it may reasonably be doubted whether the meaning has yet been discovered. But he who has wisdom and understanding, will see that all the enemies of God are numbered and marked out for destruction; that the term of their power will soon expire, and that all nations shall submit to our King of righteousness and peace.</body></html>
