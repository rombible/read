When men lose the sense of duty,--the will to ask, "Is it right?"--they become an easy prey to some specious deception. This is the reason that, both in the old and new dispensations, a caution against "immoral marvels" is entered (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm" title="For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.">Matthew 24:24</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9</a>); mere greatness, either of achievement or of miracle, is no guarantee of a good cause. The motto "Might is right is the motto of worldliness; "Right is might" is the motto of faith, and those who hold it cannot worship the beast, even though the stroke of his death-wound is healed. Men have appealed to lying miracles on behalf of a death-wounded creed: the cleverness of self-interested partisanship is seldom barren of imposing expedients.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast,</span> he deceives by employing false signs, and he deceives by inducing men to believe that the worship of the first beast is allowable. Those "that dwell on the earth" are the worldly minded, as in ver. 12. "Which he had power to do" should rather be "which it was given him to do," as in the Revised Version. The power possessed by the beast does not originate with himself; he possesses it only subject to the will of God (cf. vers. 5 and 7). Thus the second beast - self deceit - beguiles men. They accept exhibitions of power external to God as evidences of an independence and self sufficiency which do not exist apart from God, forgetful of the fact that this power is derived from God: <span class="accented">it is given</span> by him. (For "in the sight of the beast," see on ver. 12.) <span class="cmt_word">Saying to them that dwell on the earth.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "saying," masculine, agrees with the neuter <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The writer uses the masculine, as in ver. 8, because of the personified nature of the beast. It is not fair to press the word (as some writers do) into the signification that a man must be intended. "Them that dwell on the earth" - the worldly minded (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live;</span> <span class="accented">who hath the stroke of a sword, and lived</span>, as in the Revised Version. The masculine as before (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). This beast suggested that men should set up an image of the first beast, not in order to pay greater honour to the first beast, but that an apparent alternative might be offered to men, so that those who hesitated to pay direct allegiance to the first beast might overcome their scruples and worship something which resembled him, while allowing them to, as it were, cheat their own consciences by persuading themselves that they were not worshipping the beast himself. These two classes of men are, of course, essentially one; they are, in reality, all followers of the beast; but still there is a difference in the manner in which they become worshippers of the beast. The distinction of the two classes seems to be kept in mind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> and Revelation 20:4, where, however, all are included in the same condemnation. Thus the apostle teaches us that those who, by specious and plausible reasoning, who, in short, by self deceit, allow themselves to east in their lot with the worldly - the avowed followers of the first beast - are equally guilty with those who openly proclaim themselves followers of the world. (On the last part of the verse, the nature of the sword stroke, see on ver. 3.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:11-18 Those who understand the first beast to denote a worldly power, take the second to be also a persecuting and assumed power, which acts under the disguise of religion, and of charity to the souls of men. It is a spiritual dominion, professing to be derived from Christ, and exercised at first in a gentle manner, but soon spake like the dragon. Its speech betrayed it; for it gives forth those false doctrines and cruel decrees, which show it to belong to the dragon, and not to the Lamb. It exercised all the power of the former beast. It pursues the same design, to draw men from worshipping the true God, and to subject the souls of men to the will and control of men. The second beast has carried on its designs, by methods whereby men should be deceived to worship the former beast, in the new shape, or likeness made for it. By lying wonders, pretended miracles. And by severe censures. Also by allowing none to enjoy natural or civil rights, who will not worship that beast which is the image of the pagan beast. It is made a qualification for buying and selling, as well as for places of profit and trust, that they oblige themselves to use all their interest, power, and endeavour, to forward the dominion of the beast, which is meant by receiving his mark. To make an image to the beast, whose deadly wound was healed, would be to give form and power to his worship, or to require obedience to his commands. To worship the image of the beast, implies being subject to those things which stamp the character of the picture, and render it the image of the beast. The number of the beast is given, so as to show the infinite wisdom of God, and to exercise the wisdom of men. The number is the number of a man, computed after the usual manner among men, and it is 666. What or who is intended by this, remains a mystery. To almost every religious dispute this number has yet been applied, and it may reasonably be doubted whether the meaning has yet been discovered. But he who has wisdom and understanding, will see that all the enemies of God are numbered and marked out for destruction; that the term of their power will soon expire, and that all nations shall submit to our King of righteousness and peace.</body></html>
