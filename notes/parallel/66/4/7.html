The rendering "beasts" introduces confusion of thought, and violates the laws of Apocalyptic, indeed of Bible imagery. The evil powers are described under the emblem of wild beasts; for thus brute force, and unrestrained passion, and self-will, &c., are symbolised. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-2.htm" title="And the first went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image.">Revelation 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm" title="So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-7.htm" title="And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-19.htm" title="And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.">Revelation 19:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm" title="And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.">Revelation 20:10</a>.) But these "living beings" do not represent the evil element in the world. They are representative of animated nature. They are four in number--as there are four beings which hold a primacy in the world: among created beings, man; among birds, the eagle; among cattle, the ox; among untamed animals, the lion. The characteristics of these four chiefs of creation unite to make a perfect picture of the spirit of true service, which should be brave as the lion, patient as the ox, aspiring as the eagle, intelligent as man. It may here be noted that the number "four" in the Apocalypse is almost always associated with the earth. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a>.) We need only call to mind the four quarters, four elements, four seasons, to see its fitness. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-13.htm" title="On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.">Revelation 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm" title="And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.">Revelation 21:16</a>.) The living creatures are "full of eyes." This strong expression is used again in the next verse. Twice used, its meaning must be significant. The same idea is found in the later prophets of the Old Testament. The wheels of Ezekiel and their tires (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm" title="As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.">Ezekiel 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-12.htm" title="And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.">Ezekiel 10:12</a>) were full of eyes. The stone of Zechariah had seven (the perfect number) eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm" title="For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; on one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving thereof, said the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.">Zechariah 3:9</a>). The thought is emphasised again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>, where the Lamb is said to have seven eyes. Multiplicity of eyes may symbolise vitality and vigilance. Some have thought, inappropriately enough, that it signifies the unceasing praise of God's works. A better interpretation is given by Dr. Currey. "The power of nature is no blind force, it is employed in the service of God's providence, and all over it the stamp of reason is impressed." (See Speaker's <span class= "ital">Commentary</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm" title="As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.">Ezekiel 1:18</a>). May we not add that the force of nature is always observant of God's will? Its myriad eyes are fixed on Him, as the eyes of a servant on his master (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-2.htm" title="Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait on the LORD our God, until that he have mercy on us.">Psalm 123:2</a>); doing His commandment, hearkening unto the voice of His word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/103-20.htm" title="Bless the LORD, you his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word.">Psalm 103:20-21</a>); the eyes too of all creation wait on God, who gives them meat in due season (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-27.htm" title="These wait all on you; that you may give them their meat in due season.">Psalm 104:27</a>, Prayer Book version)--<p>"His state<p>Is kingly; thousands at His bidding speed And post o'er land and ocean without rest;<p>They also serve who only stand and wait."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.</span> (Upon "beast" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), see on ver. 6. For the signification, see also above on ver. 6.) Whether there was any difference in the forms as a whole, or whether the difference consisted chiefly or solely in the thee, cannot be certainly known. Each being is symbolical of some class or some quality of which it is representative. (For the application, see on ver. 6.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to the churches the things that are, there was another vision. The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.</body></html>
