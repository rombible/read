(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>.) It should run--<p>"Worthy art Thou, O Lord, and our God,<p>To receive the glory, and the honour, and the power,<p>Because Thou didst create all things,<p>And through (or, <span class= "ital">owing to--i.e.</span>, because of) Thy will they <span class= "ital">were</span> (not ' are') and were created."<p>The existence of all things was owing to the will of God, as also was the creation of all things, which was the realisation or manifestation of that will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art worthy, O Lord</span>; or, <span class="accented">thou art worthy, our Lord and our God.</span> In 13, the Syriac, Andreas, Arethas, Theodore-Stud., Arm., and many others, <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the holy one," is added. <span class="cmt_word">To receive glory and honour and power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, etc.). The presence of the article either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> denotes universality, and the expression is thus equivalent to "all glory," "all honour," "all power; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> refers to the glory and honour mentioned in ver. 9. The former view seems more probable (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>). The Church is represented as ascribing to God all power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); that power which he exercises in its fulness in heaven, and which, though partially abrogated on earth, he will nevertheless again take up, as foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>. For thou hast created all things; or, <span class="accented">for thou didst create all things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented">- the universe.</span> The representatives of creation thank God for their existence; the Church sees in his creation reason to ascribe power to him. Thus the reason for the doxology is given - "because thou didst create." And for thy pleasure; much better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and because of thy will</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). When God willed it, the universe had no existence; again, when he willed it, the universe came into being. <span class="cmt_word">They are, and were created</span>; or, <span class="accented">they were, and were created</span> (Revised Version). There are three variations in the reading of this passage: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> al40 fere Vulgate, Coptic, Syriac, Arethas, Primasius (in another version), anon-Augustine, Haymo; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;</span> is read in S, P, 1, 7, 35, 49, 79, 87, 91, <span class="accented">et al.</span> et Andreas; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is read in B, 14, 38, 51. "They were" signifies "they existed," whereas before they were not in existence; "and were created" points to the manner of coming into existence and the Person to whom this existence was due. If <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;</span> be read, the meaning is the same. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> would simplify the sentence very much. It would then run: <span class="accented">For thy pleasure</span>, or, <span class="accented">At thy will they were not existent, and again, at thy will they were created.</span> But the weight of authority is against this reading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-11 All true believers wholly ascribe their redemption and conversion, their present privileges and future hopes, to the eternal and most holy God. Thus rise the for-ever harmonious, thankful songs of the redeemed in heaven. Would we on earth do like them, let our praises be constant, not interrupted; united, not divided; thankful, not cold and formal; humble, not self-confident.</body></html>
