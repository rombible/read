In the similar vision in Ezekiel no human beings are seen; their appearance here is significant. They are the representatives of Christ's Church and people, of those whom Christ calls His friends, and who are admitted to know what their Lord doeth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-15.htm" title="From now on I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.">John 15:15</a>). Various reasons have been suggested why they should be described as twenty-four in number; they are the twelve tribes doubled, to signify the union of the Gentile with the Jewish Church; they are the two sets of twelve, to represent the two Testaments; they are the twelve Patriarchs cojoined with the twelve Apostles. It will be seen that these were all different forms of the same thought, that the twenty-four elders represent the complete Church of God in the past and in the future, in the Jewish and Gentile worlds; and as such the true spiritual successors, as priests to God, of those twenty-four courses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/24-1.htm" title="Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.">1Chronicles 24:1-19</a>) arranged by David, and which some have thought gave rise to the use of the number twenty-four in this passage. It is the great united Church. The same thought is touched upon in the double song of Moses and the Lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm" title="And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, you King of saints.">Revelation 15:3</a>), and in the gates and foundations of the New Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm" title="And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:">Revelation 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And round about the throne were four and twenty seats</span>. Throughout the vision no past tense is used. The vision represents the worship of heaven (so far as it can be presented to human understanding) as it continues eternally. <span class="accented">Thrones.. seats.</span> Render both by the same English word, as in the Revised Version. Some doubt is attached to the case of the first <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, is found in B, P; and this makes the construction nominative after <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span> (cf. ver. 2); but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, 34, 35, read <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, which causes <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to be understood. The point is immaterial, as the meaning is the same. <span class="cmt_word">And upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting</span>. Omit "I saw" (see above). The number twenty-four, the double of twelve, represents the Churches of both the old and the new covenants. The elders are the heads or representatives of the body to which they belong (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-7.htm">Exodus 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>, and many others; see also the list of <span class="accented">elders</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.). In the Christian Church the same distinction exists (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>, "ordained them <span class="accented">elders</span>;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a>, St. Paul sent for <span class="accented">the elders</span> of Ephesus; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>, "The elders were present"). So here the <span class="accented">elders</span> represent the saints of both the Old and New Testaments. Thus they offer "the prayers of the saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>). Christ, moreover, promised twelve thrones to his disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>) though not to the exclusion of the saints of old, for both are conjoined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12, 14</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2, 3</a>, the victorious ones sing "the song of <span class="accented">Moses</span> and of the <span class="accented">Lamb."</span> Other interpretations which have been advanced are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the twenty-four elders represent the great and minor prophets (St. Hippolytus); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> higher angels - the celestial priesthood, as denoted by their white garments and the number twenty-four, the number of courses of the Levitical priesthood (Reuss); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> simply angels (Hoffmann); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the elders of the Church at Jerusalem (Grotius); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the doubled twelve signifies the accession of the Gentiles (Bleek, De Wette); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the books of the Old Testament. then the Jewish Church, while the four living creatures denote the Gospels, that is, the Christian Church (Wordsworth). (For this last view, for which there is much to be said, see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) Clothed in white raiment; the natural garb of heaven, symbolical of purify. And they had on their heads crowns of gold (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). The crown of victory, not necessarily the kingly crown. Possibly a reference to the priestly crown (see on Revelation 2:10). Trench and Vaughan, however, are of opinion that the crowns here denote the kingly condition of the saints. But Christians are nowhere in the New Testament described as "kings." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to the churches the things that are, there was another vision. The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.</body></html>
