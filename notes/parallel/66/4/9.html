It is not to Him who sat upon the throne, but to Him who sitteth there, as he liveth to the ages of ages, that this homage is paid. The future tense <span class= "ital">(shall </span>give glory, &c.) implies the eternal repetition of the act. The connection between the praise given by creation, and the consequent homage of the twenty-four elders, expresses a truth. The Church of Christ does not always hear the voice of praise from created things. Often the creation groaneth" and travaileth; but her chorus of praise rises when she perceives that "every thing that hath breath praiseth the Lord." The converse of this thought -- the earth bringeth forth her fruit when the people praise God--is hinted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/67-5.htm" title="Let the people praise you, O God; let all the people praise you.">Psalm 67:5-6</a>, "the earth ceases her travail when the sons of God are made manifest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19-21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Crowns.</span>--The crowns are not royal crowns, but the crowns of conquerors.

The Eucharistic hymn recognizes the glory and honour which are the inseparable attributes of God, and renders the thanks due to him from his creation.

"Who liveth forever and ever" declares that attribute which was ascribed to God, in the song of the living beings, by the words, "which was, and is, and is to come" (see on ver. 8). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:9-11 All true believers wholly ascribe their redemption and conversion, their present privileges and future hopes, to the eternal and most holy God.

Would we on earth do like them, let our praises be constant, not interrupted; united, not divided; thankful, not cold and formal; humble, not self-confident.</body></html>
