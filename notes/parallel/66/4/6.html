The woman apparelled in purple splendour sits upon many waters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>). The waters are explained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-15.htm" title="And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.">Revelation 17:15</a>) to be "peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues." Her throne rests on the fickle and stormy sea of world- opinion, fashion, and passion. The waters represent the unguided, unreasoning, and unprincipled thoughts of men. By analogy, the calm glass-like sea, which is never in storm, but only interfused with flame (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a>), represents the counsels of God, those purposes of righteousness and love, often fathomless, but never obscure; always the same, though sometimes glowing with holy anger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-1.htm" title="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.">Revelation 15:1</a>).

The position of the crystal sea is analogous to that of the molten sea in front of Solomon's Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/4-9.htm" title="Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.">2Chronicles 4:9-10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And in the midst of the throne--</span>i.e., between the seer and the throne. The Apostle saw the crystal sea, and beyond it the living creatures encircling the throne--four living creatures (or, <span class= "ital">living beings)</span> full of (or, <span class= "ital">teeming with)</span> eyes before and behind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal. <span class="accented">Sea of glass</span>, or <span class="accented">a glassy sea.</span> The quality of "glassiness" may refer to the pure <span class="accented">appearance</span> of the sea; or it may mean that the sea was in consistency like unto glass; that is, solid and unyielding, so that there was nothing strange in the fact that it supported weights. In either case, the notion is repeated by parallelism in the next clause, "like unto crystal." But the glassy sea may mean "a glass laver," and bear no reference to what is usually called a sea. The brazen laver is described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>) as a "molten sea." St. John may therefore mean that before the throne of God was a laver of the purest material, just as the brazen laver was before the temple. One difficulty here presents itself, viz. that there would be no use for a laver in heaven, where all is pure, and the figure therefore appears a little incongruous. But as it stood <span class="accented">before</span> the throne, where all who came would have to pass by, it may fitly typify the waters of Baptism, passed by all Christians; and the figure would be aptly suggested to St. John by the furniture of the temple to which he has such constant allusions. <span class="cmt_word">And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne</span>. This may mean either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, the throne being rectangular, the four living beings were in the middle of each side of the parallelogram; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> while one was in front of the throne, the other three formed a semicircle round it, one being directly behind, and two towards the ends. <span class="cmt_word">Were four beasts;</span> <span class="accented">or, four living creatures</span> (Revised Version); or, better still, <span class="accented">four living beings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>). The "beast" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-7.htm">Revelation 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, etc., must not be confounded with the "living ones" of this passage. The one quality connoted by the term here used is the possession of life. The question of the precise meaning and interpretation of the vision of "the living beings" is a difficult one, and much has been written concerning it. The vision is evidently connected with the appearances described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. and 10, and which are called in Isaiah "seraphim," in Ezekiel "cherubim." We are led, therefore, to inquire what mental ideas were pictured to the Jews under the symbolical forms of cherubim and seraphim. Cheyne shows ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 272) that the name <span class="accented">cherub</span> is probably connected with <span class="accented">kirubu</span>, the winged ox god of the Assyrians, and with <span class="accented">kurubu</span>, the vulture or eagle (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the guardians of the treasures of the gods); and he infers that among heathen nations the mythic cherubim denote the cloud-masses which appear to guard the portals of the sky, and on which the sun-god issues at break of day. With regard to the seraphim, he compares the name of the fiery serpents(<span class="accented">s'rafim</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, and concludes that the term was symbolical of the lightning, the weapon of the gods. Now, in Old Testament passages the cherubim and seraphim are always pictured as the attendants of God, and the workers of his purposes and judgments - an idea which may readily have been assimilated by the Jews from the conceptions of their heathen neighbours. Thus cherubim with the flaming sword are placed at the entrance of the garden of Eden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); Jehovah rode upon a cherub, and did fly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>); he communes with his people from between the cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>); he is the Shepherd of Israel, who dwells between the cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>); the temple in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> is adorned with cherubim, as being the dwelling-place of God; they are the attendants of the glory of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22-28</a>; and the seraphim fill an analogous position (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>). We may therefore infer that the appearance of the "living beings" implied the presence of some order of beings in attendance upon God, the workers of his will, and the manifestation of his glory. Again, the term used (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>) and the characteristics of the appearance naturally and almost irresistibly lead us to interpret the form as one symbolical of <span class="accented">life.</span> The human face, the ox as the representative of domestic, and the lion of wild animals, and the eagle among birds, appear to be typical of the four most conspicuous orders of animal life. The ceaseless movements described in ver. 8 portray the same idea. The four living beings draw attention to the woes heaped upon created life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). The <span class="accented">eyes</span> denote never-resting activity. We may therefore believe that the living beings are symbolical of all creation fulfilling its proper office - waiting upon God, fulfilling his will, and setting forth his glory. It is noteworthy that the human face, as distinct from the Church, which is represented by the four and twenty elders, appears to indicate the power of God to use, for his purposes and his glory, that part of mankind which has not been received into the Church - the part which constitutes the "other sheep, not of this fold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>). These representatives of created life worship God, and give (ver. 11), as a reason for ascribing glory and honour to him, the circumstance that "thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created." The following are other interpretations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The living beings represent the four Gospels. This view is held by many ancient writers, though there are many variations in assigning to each Gospel its own representative. Victorinus considers the <span class="accented">man</span> to be a type of St. Matthew, who sets forth prominently the human nature of our Lord; the kingly <span class="accented">lion</span> is referred to St. Mark; the sacrificial ox to St. Luke; the aspiring <span class="accented">eagle</span> to St. John. Amongst the supporters of this interpretation (though varying in the precise applicability) are St. Augustine, St. Jerome, St. Athanasius, St. Irenaeus, St. Gregory, St. Ambrose, Andreas, Primasius, Bede, I. Williams, Wordsworth (for a lull exposition of this view, see <span class="accented">Wordsworth, in loc.</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The four great apostles: St. Peter, the lion; James the brother of the Lord, the ox; St. Matthew, the man; St. Paul, the eagle (Grotius). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Church of the New Testament; as the Church of the Old Testament was represented by the standards or four tribes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.), on which these devices were emblazoned according to tradition (Mede). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The four patriarchal Churches: the <span class="accented">man</span>, Alexandria, famed for learning; <span class="accented">the lion</span>, Jerusalem, <span class="accented">"propter</span> constantiam" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>); the <span class="accented">ox</span>, Antioch, as "parata obedire mandatis apostolorum;" the <span class="accented">eagle</span>, Constantinople, remarkable for men "per contemplationem elevati, ut Grog. Naz." (De Lyra and a Lapide). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The four cardinal virtues (Arethas). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The four elements (the 'Catena,' p. 246) - a view not materially differing from that first set forth above, bearing in mind the idea of the ancients that all creation was formed from the four elements. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The four motive powers of the human soul: reason, anger, desire, conscience (a Lapide, quoting Grog. Naz.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The doctors of the Church (Vitringa). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(9)</span> Four attributes of our Lord: his humanity, sacrificial life, his kingly nature, his perfect and spiritual nature soaring beyond all other men (Arethas-Cramer, p. 245). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(10)</span> The four orders: pastoral, diaconal, doctoral, contemplative, (Joachim). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(11)</span> The four principal angels (a Lapide). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(12)</span> Four apostolic virtues (Alcasar). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(13)</span> The attributes of divinity: wisdom, power, omniscience, creation (Renan). <span class="cmt_word">Full of eyes before and behind.</span> From <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2, 3</a> the idea of six wings is borrowed, and also the "Holy, holy, holy" from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5, 6</a>; the <span class="accented">four figures and four faces</span> (which are united in Ezekiel, but made separate in the Revelation); and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a> the body <span class="accented">full of eyes.</span> The <span class="accented">eyes</span> denote unceasing activity. If the four living beings all faced towards the throne while standing on each side of it, St. John would see them in various positions, and observe the back as well as the front. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to the churches the things that are, there was another vision. The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.</body></html>
