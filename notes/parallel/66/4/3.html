The sardian, or sardine, is admitted to be a stone of fiery red colour; the emerald, to which the bow round the throne is compared, is almost certainly a bright green; the hue of the jasper is the difficulty. The jasper--the last stone in the high-priest's breastplate, and first of the twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-20.htm" title="And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be set in gold in their settings.">Exodus 28:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm" title="And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;">Revelation 21:19</a>)--is described by the best authorities as a dark, opaque green. Such a colour is quite in harmony with the colours of the other stones in the breastplate, and particularly with the foundation stones, which seem to be arranged in shades of colour (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm" title="And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;">Revelation 21:19</a> <span class= "ital">et seq</span>.); but the dark opaque green would be an ill combination with the red sardius and the green emerald in the vision of the present chapter. Is there no further light? We have a jasper stone spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-11.htm" title="Having the glory of God: and her light was like to a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;">Revelation 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-18.htm" title="And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like to clear glass.">Revelation 21:18</a>, with the descriptive phrase, "clear as crystal!" Does not this point to a stone somewhat different in appearance from that spoken of simply as jasper? Such a clear crystal stone would be the most natural companion to the sardine, and the combination of the sparkling brightness and fiery red suits the union of brightness and flame which appears elsewhere in the Bible (comp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm" title="His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;">Revelation 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.">Revelation 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-2.htm" title="Then I beheld, and see a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.">Ezekiel 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a>), and is best understood of the holiness and righteousness of God. The latter half of this verse shows us these surrounded by the emerald-coloured bow, the evident symbol of the divine mercy. The allusion to the bow in the cloud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/9-12.htm" title="And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:">Genesis 9:12-16</a>) is obvious; the bow completely encircled the throne, as mercy encompassing judgment. It was a covenant token, bearing witness to God's faithfulness in dark times, God's care for the ark of His Church, and His mercy shining forth after storm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat was to look upon like</span>, etc.; or, <span class="accented">he that sat like in appearance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is found in this verse and in two other places only in the New Testament, viz. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> (where it is part of a quotation from Joel) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a>. In the latter place the expression is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the presence of the preposition, together with the article, seems to justify the rendering "in the vision." In the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is frequently used to signify either "vision" or "appearance" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Ezekiel 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a> and Daniel 8:1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>; and many others, where it is "vision." Also <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5, 13, 26-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>; and many others, where it is "appearance"). In the classics, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> signifies a "vision;" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "sight," the power of seeing. <span class="cmt_word">A jasper and a sardine stone</span>. The <span class="accented">jasper</span> was the last, and the <span class="accented">sardius</span> the first stone of the high priest's breastplate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17</a>). The jasper was the first, and the sardius the sixth of the foundations of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19, 20</a>). Much doubt is attached to the whole subject of the precious stones of the Bible. The modern jasper is opaque, while it is evident that the jasper of the Revelation is remarkable for its translucent character (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a>, "jasper stone. clear as crystal;" 21:18, "The building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass"). It is evident that the stone was characterized by purity and brilliancy - features which seem to point it out as the modern diamond. The varying colour, which, according to some authorities, the jasper possessed, is not inconsistent with this view. It is curious, too, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-18.htm">Exodus 28:18</a>, the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, which in the Authorized Version is rendered "diamond," is represented in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; while in ver. 20, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> the English "jasper," is <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="accented">sardius</span> was the carnelian, always red, though somewhat varying in shade. The name has been variously derived from <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Persian <span class="accented">sered</span>, yellowish red; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Sardis, as the first place of its discovery; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> while carnelian is connected with <span class="accented">carneus</span>, as being of the colour of raw flesh. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Skeat derives the word from <span class="accented">cornu</span>, a horn; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the term being thus an allusion to the semitransparent nature of the stone. The pure jasper, together with the red sardius, may fitly typify God's purity and mercy together with his justice and judgment. <span class="cmt_word">And there was a rainbow round about the throne.</span> The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ca;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which is used here, is not found in the LXX.? where <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is invariably found, probably to avoid reference to a term which was so pre-eminently heathen. The rainbow is here, as always (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12, 13</a>), a token of God's faithfulness in keeping his promises. It is, therefore, a fit sign of comfort to those persecuted Christians to whom, and for whose edification, this message was sent. In sight like unto an emerald. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is our modern green emerald. It was highly valued in Roman times. It was one of the stones of the high priest's breastplate, and the fourth foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>). The description in this verse recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-23.htm">Ezekiel 1:23</a>, "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain. so was the appearance of the brightness round about." Some have found a difficulty in the association of a rainbow with its varied colours, and the single green hue of the emerald. But of course it is the form only of the rainbow which is alluded to, not every quality which a rainbow may possess. A circular green appearance was seen round the throne, which perhaps may be described as a green halo. If the purity of the jasper (see above) be allowed to symbolize God's purity and spirituality, and the sardine, man clothed with flesh, the green emerald may fitly represent God's goodness displayed in nature. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to the churches the things that are, there was another vision. The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.</body></html>
