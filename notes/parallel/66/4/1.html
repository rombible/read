There are differences as well as similarities between this vision and others where glimpses into heaven were given to prophets and saints. In Ezekiel's vision, and in the scene of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a> (comp, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-11.htm" title="And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending on him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:">Acts 10:11</a>) the heavens divide; in this a door stands open. The way into the presence of God lies open (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>); all who have faith may enter; in the minds of such the thoughts of the heavenly will mingle with the sorrows of the earthly, and the calm of security will be theirs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm" title="God is in the middle of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.">Psalm 46:5</a>). But the scenes of earth's troubles will always be dispiriting to those who cannot reach the heavenly view-point.<p><span class= "bld">And the first voice </span>(or, <span class= "ital">behold, the first voice) </span><span class= "bld">which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me</span>; (even one) <span class= "bld">which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee </span><span class= "ital">(the)</span> <span class= "bld">things which must be hereafter.--</span>The <span class= "ital">first</span> voice here spoken of is the voice which the Apostle had heard in the opening vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>); he heard, and recognised that trumpet-like voice again. It is strange that any should have maintained that this is not the voice of Christ. It is admitted that it must be the same as the voice of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>; but it is said that the voice of Christ is heard afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm" title="And his feet like to fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.">Revelation 1:15</a>), not as a trumpet, but as the voice of many waters. The answer is simple; the voice of Christ has many tones; and the voice like a trumpet said, "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10-13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this</span>; or, <span class="accented">after these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). There is no good ground for supposing, as some do, that, after the events narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3.htm">Revelation 3</a>, an interval occurred in the visions, during which St. John possibly wrote down the matter contained in the first three chapters. Nor is there any justification for assigning what follows to a time after this world. It would be pressing <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> very far to make it apply to these present things of the world; and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> certainly need not mean "the things after this world." The expression is used here in its ordinary, natural sense: "After having seen this, I saw," etc.; introducing some new phase or variety of spectacle. <span class="cmt_word">I looked</span>; or, <span class="accented">I saw</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). No fresh act of <span class="accented">looking</span> is signified. <span class="accented">I saw in</span> the Spirit, as formerly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, a door;</span> or, <span class="accented">and, behold, a door, and the first voice.</span> Such is the construction of the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">Was opened in heaven</span>; or, <span class="accented">an open door, in heaven.</span> St. John did not see the action of opening the door, but he saw a door which had been set open, through which he might gaze, and observe what passed within. Alford contrasts <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>, where "the heaven was opened;" and supposes that the seer is transported through the open door into heaven, from which position he sees heaven, and views all that happens on the earth. Victorinus aptly compares the <span class="accented">open door</span> to the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">And the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me</span>. Omit the "was" which follows, as well as the colon which precedes, and repeat "a voice," as in the Revised Version: <span class="accented">And, behold, an open door in heaven, and the first voice which 1 heard, the voice which was, as it were, of a trumpet.</span> The voice signified is not the <span class="accented">first</span>, but the <span class="accented">former</span> voice; viz. that already heard and described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>. The possessor of the voice is not indicated. Stier ('Reden Jesu') attributes the voice to Christ; but it seems rather that of an angel, or at any rate not that of Christ, whose voice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a> is described as "of many waters, "not as" of a trumpet." <span class="cmt_word">Which said</span>. The voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) becomes masculine (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). Though <span class="accented">whose</span> voice is not stated, yet the vividness and reality of the vision causes the writer to speak of the <span class="accented">voice</span> as the personal being whom it signifies. Come up hither. That is in the Spirit - for the apostle "immediately was in the Spirit" (ver. 2). He was to receive a yet higher insight into spiritual things (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, where St. Paul was "caught up into the third heaven"). <span class="cmt_word">And I will show thee</span>. It is not necessary, with Stier (see above on ver. 1), to infer that these words are Christ's. Though from him all the revelation comes, he may well use the ministry of angels through whom to signify his will. <span class="cmt_word">Things which must be hereafter</span>; or, <span class="accented">the things which must happen hereafter.</span> The things which it is right should happen, and which, therefore, must needs happen (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>). "Hereafter" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); as before in ver. 1, but in a somewhat more general and less definite sense - at <span class="accented">some time after this</span>; but when precisely is not stated. The full stop may possibly be better placed before "hereafter;" in which case "hereafter" would introduce the following phrase, exactly as before in this verse. There is no "and;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, though in the Textus Receptus, is omitted in the best manuscripts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to the churches the things that are, there was another vision. The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.</body></html>
