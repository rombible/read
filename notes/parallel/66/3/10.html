Such is "the <span class= "ital">benigna talio</span> of the kingdom of God," as Archbishop Trench calls it. The promise does not mean the being kept away from, but the being kept out from the tribulation. The head should be kept above the waters; they should not be ashamed, because they had kept the word of patience. It is through <span class= "ital">patience, </span>as well as comfort of the Scripture that we have the hope which maketh not ashamed. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm" title="Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:">Romans 15:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/3-3.htm" title="Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent.

This is the Divine <span class="accented">lex talionis.</span> "Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-37.htm">Luke 6:37, 38</a>); keep, and ye shall be kept. Compare "I know mine own, and mine own know me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>). "The word of my patience" may mean either the gospel, which everywhere teaches patience, or those sayings of Christ in which he specially inculcates this duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-19.htm">Luke 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-13.htm">Matthew 24:13</a>). In "I also will keep thee" the two pronouns are in emphatic contrast. From the hour of temptation. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>, where we have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>). It is not certain that the common explanation, that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> implies exemption from trial, while <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> implies preservation under trial, holds good. "Temptation" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) generally has no article in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>, etc.; comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>). Here it has the article, as if "the temptation" were to be of no ordinary kind. The word does not occur elsewhere in St. John's writings. In order to bring substantive and verb into harmony, the Revised Version renders <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> "trial," the word for "to try" being <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. "World" here is not the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the ordered universe" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>), but the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "the inhabited earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>). The phrase, "to dwell upon the earth," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, is peculiar to the Apocalypse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-13.htm">Revelation 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-10.htm">Revelation 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8, 14</a>). "The hour of trial" seems to be that which Christ had foretold should precede his coming, especially the triumph of antichrist. Hence the declaration in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 The same Lord Jesus has the key of government and authority in and over the church. He opens a door of opportunity to his churches; he opens a door of utterance to his ministers; he opens a door of entrance, opens the heart. He shuts the door of heaven against the foolish, who sleep away their day of grace; and against the workers of iniquity, how vain and confident soever they may be. The church in Philadelphia is commended; yet with a gentle reproof. Although Christ accepts a little strength, yet believers must not rest satisfied in a little, but strive to grow in grace, to be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Christ can discover this his favour to his people, so that their enemies shall be forced to acknowledge it. This, by the grace of Christ, will soften their enemies, and make them desire to be admitted into communion with his people. Christ promises preserving grace in the most trying times, as the reward of past faithfulness; To him that hath shall be given. Those who keep the gospel in a time of peace, shall be kept by Christ in an hour of temptation; and the same Divine grace that has made them fruitful in times of peace, will make them faithful in times of persecution. Christ promises a glorious reward to the victorious believer. He shall be a monumental pillar in the temple of God; a monument of the free and powerful grace of God; a monument that shall never be defaced or removed. On this pillar shall be written the new name of Christ; by this will appear, under whom the believer fought the good fight, and came off victorious.</body></html>
