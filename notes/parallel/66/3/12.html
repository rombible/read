(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Write upon him.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">grave upon it.</span> On the sides of the four marble pillars which survive as ruins of Philadelphia inscriptions are to be found. The writing would be the name of God, the name of the heavenly Jerusalem and (omit the repetition, "I will write upon him") the new, unknown name of Christ Himself. The allusion is to the golden frontlet inscribed with the name of Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm" title="And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.">Revelation 22:4</a>.) He will reflect the likeness of God; and not only so, he will bear the tokens--now seen in all clearness--of his heavenly citizenship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22-23</a>). And a further promise implies that in the day of the last triumph, as there will be new revealings of Christ's power, there will be unfolded to the faithful and victorious new and higher possibilities of purity. Thus does Scripture refuse to recognise any finality which is not a beginning as well as an end--a landing-stage in the great law of continuity. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Him that overcometh will I make a pillar. (For construction, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, see on Revelation 2:26.) The "overcoming" is a present continuous process, but will have a termination, and then he who has faithfully fought the daily battle will be made <span class="accented">a pillar</span>, steadfast, immovable. St. John may be alluding to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the two pillars of Solomon's temple set up in the porch, and called <span class="accented">Jachin</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> he will establish) and <span class="accented">Boaz</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e5;</span>, in him is strength); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15, 21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>. Both names signify steadfastness and permanence, and would serve to render emphatic the superiority in these respects of the reward to come when compared with the evanescent nature of present suffering. <span class="accented">A pillar is</span> constantly used as a figure of strength and durability (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A contrast may be intended between the immovableness of the Christian's future position and the liability of pillars in the Philadelphian temples to succumb to the effects of the frequent earthquakes which took place there (see on ver. 7). Such pillars, moreover, were frequently sculptured in human shape. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Matthew Henry suggests that a reference <span class="accented">may</span> be intended to monumental pillars bearing inscriptions; the signification being "a monumental pillar of the free and powerful grace of God, never to be defaced or removed; not a support - heaven needing no such props." But it <span class="accented">seems</span> much more likely that St. John is alluding to the Hebrew temple. In the temple. The <span class="accented">temple</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, the shrine, the dwelling place of God, not <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, the whole extent of the sacred buildings. The latter word occurs often in St. John's Gospel, but never in the Apocalypse. The <span class="accented">temple</span> in the Revelation is the abode of God, the sacred shrine into which all may be privileged to enter, both in this world and in the world to come. Of my God (see note on Revelation 3:2; 2:7). And he shall go no more out. "And out of it he shall in no wise go out more:" such is the full force of the Greek. The conqueror's period of probation will be over, and he shall be for ever free from the possibility of falling away. Trench quotes St. Augustine: "Quis non desideret illam civi-tatem, unde amicus non exit, quo inimicus non intrat?" And I will write upon him the name of my God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>, "His name shall be in their foreheads;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>, "Those which have not the seal of God in their foreheads;" the former passage referring to the elect in heaven, the latter distinguishing Christians on earth from their heathen oppressors). In the passage under consideration the action is future; it does not refer to holy baptism, but to the sealing of the faithful upon their entrance into glory - a sealing which shall settle for ever, and make all things sure. "To write the name upon" anything is a common figurative expression in Hebrew to denote taking absolute possession of, and making completely one's own. Thus Joab fears that Rabbah may be called after his name, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> looked upon as his, if David should be absent at the capture of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-28.htm">2 Samuel 12:28</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-27.htm">Numbers 6:27</a>). The struggling Christian is encouraged by hearing that a time will come when he will without any doubt become God's own, incapable of being removed or claimed by other. In the rabbinical book, 'Bava Bathra,' 75. 2, it is noted that there are three applications of the name of God: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the just (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A reference may be intended to the frontlet of the high priest, upon which was inscribed, "Holiness to the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). The inscription is threefold: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the name of God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the name of the new Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the name of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For God was the Christian maintaining his warfare; to the Church, the new Jerusalem, was he rendering this service; under Christ, as Captain, was the fight being accomplished. Again, the victorious Christian was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to belong completely to God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to possess the citizenship of the new Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to enter into the glory of Christ, which was the new name, that which he knew not yet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We can here trace an analogy to the baptismal formula. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The name of God the Father, whose we are made; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> God the Holy Ghost, whose indwelling guides and sustains his Church, the new Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> God the Son, by whose Name we shall enter glory. <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the city of my God</span>, which is <span class="cmt_word">new Jerusalem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the city</span>... <span class="accented">new Jerusalem</span> (see Revised Version). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a> the name given to the city Jerusalem is Jehovah Shammah, "the Lord is there;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> Jehovah Tsidkenu, "the Lord our Righteousness." Either of these <span class="accented">may</span> be meant; but, as Alford points out, the holy name itself has already been inscribed. In any case, the victorious one is to be openly acknowledged a citizen of the new Jerusalem. The old Jerusalem was destroyed, and her citizens scattered; but a new Jerusalem, of which the true Israelites are the citizens, should reunite the faithful. It is noticeable that without exception, throughout the Revelation, St. John uses the Hebraic form of the name <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;</span>, while in the Gospel <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> always occurs. He almost seems to distinguish thus between the earthly Jerusalem and the heavenly - the home of the true Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Which cometh down out of heaven from my God</span>. "Which cometh down" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), a grammatical anomaly (cf. ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a> and Revelation 3:12). The name "new Jerusalem" is always coupled in the Revelation with the phrase, "coming down from heaven" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 10</a>). The spirituality and holiness of the Church is thus set forth, since its being is wholly due to God, in its creation and sustenance. <span class="cmt_word">And I</span> will write upon him <span class="cmt_word">my new name</span>; <span class="accented">and mine own new name</span> (Revised Version). This is not any of the names given in the Revelation, but that referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which no one knew except himself. The passage is a promise that when Christ makes us completely his own by writing his own new name on us, he will admit us into his full glory, which is at present incomprehensible to us. Such comprehension is one of the things <span class="accented">"which</span> shall be hereafter" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-19.htm">Revelation 1:19</a>), and which cannot now be known to us, <span class="accented">"for</span> now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 The same Lord Jesus has the key of government and authority in and over the church. He opens a door of opportunity to his churches; he opens a door of utterance to his ministers; he opens a door of entrance, opens the heart. He shuts the door of heaven against the foolish, who sleep away their day of grace; and against the workers of iniquity, how vain and confident soever they may be. The church in Philadelphia is commended; yet with a gentle reproof. Although Christ accepts a little strength, yet believers must not rest satisfied in a little, but strive to grow in grace, to be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Christ can discover this his favour to his people, so that their enemies shall be forced to acknowledge it. This, by the grace of Christ, will soften their enemies, and make them desire to be admitted into communion with his people. Christ promises preserving grace in the most trying times, as the reward of past faithfulness; To him that hath shall be given. Those who keep the gospel in a time of peace, shall be kept by Christ in an hour of temptation; and the same Divine grace that has made them fruitful in times of peace, will make them faithful in times of persecution. Christ promises a glorious reward to the victorious believer. He shall be a monumental pillar in the temple of God; a monument of the free and powerful grace of God; a monument that shall never be defaced or removed. On this pillar shall be written the new name of Christ; by this will appear, under whom the believer fought the good fight, and came off victorious.</body></html>
