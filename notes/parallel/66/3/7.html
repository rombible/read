It was situated on the slopes of Mount Tmolus, in the midst of a district the soil of which was favourable to the cultivation of the vine. On the coins of the town are to be found the head of Bacchus. The town was built on high ground--upwards of 900 feet above the sea-level. The whole region, however, was volcanic, and few cities suffered more from earthquakes; the frequent recurrence of these considerably reduced the population. But its favourable situation and fertile soil preserved it from entire desertion. And of all the seven churches, it had the longest life as a Christian city. "Philadelphia alone has been saved . . .; among the Greek colonies and churches of Asia, Philadelphia is still erect, a column in a scene of ruins." Such is the language of Gibbon, referring to its later history. As a light in the world at the present day, we must look to no Eastern Philadelphia; the hand of William Penn kindled a light in its great namesake of the West.<p><span class= "bld">These things saith he that is holy. . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">These things saith the Holy, the True, He that</span> <span class= "ital">hath the key of David, that openeth, and no man shall shut, and He shutteth, and no one shall open.</span><p><span class= "bld">Holy.</span>--The main idea of the word here used is that of consecration. It is used of what is set apart to God; it does not assert the possession of personal holiness, but it implies it as a duty. It becomes, therefore, pre-eminently appropriate to Him who was not only consecrate, but holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners. Prof. Plumptre thinks there may be a reference here to the confession made by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-69.htm" title="And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God.">John 6:69</a>), where the right reading is, "Thou art the Christ, the <span class= "ital">holy One</span> of God."<p><span class= "bld">True.</span>--A favourite word with St. John, and expressing more than the opposite of "false." It implies that which is perfect in contrast with the imperfect; the reality in contrast with the shadow; the antitype in contrast with the type; the ideal which is the only real in contrast with the real which is only ideal;--<p>"The flower upon the spiritual side,<p>Substantial, archetypal, all aglow<p>With blossoming causes"<p>in contrast with the flower that fadeth here. Christ, then, in calling Himself the True, declares that "all titles and names given to Him are realised in Him; the idea and the fact in Him are, what they can never be in any other, absolutely commensurate" (Trench). In some MSS. the order of these words, "the Holy," "the True," is inverted.<p><span class= "bld">The key of David.</span>--Some early commentators saw in this key the key of knowledge which the scribes had taken away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-52.htm" title="Woe to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in you hindered.">Luke 11:52</a>), and understood this expression here as implying that Christ alone could unloose the seals of Scripture, and reveal its hidden truth to men. In support of this they referred to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/5-7.htm" title="And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.">Revelation 5:7-9</a>. The fault of the interpretation is that it is too limited; it is only a corner of the full meaning. He who is "the True" alone can unlock the hidden treasures of truth. But the use of the word "David," and the obvious derivation of the latter part of this verse from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-22.htm" title="And the key of the house of David will I lay on his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.">Isaiah 22:22</a>, points to a wider meaning. Jesus Christ is the true Steward of the house of David. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;">Hebrews 3:5-6</a>.) The faulty, self-seeking stewards, the Shebnas of Jerusalem and Philadelphia, vainly claimed a right of exclusion from synagogue or church, where Jesus, the God-fixed nail in the sure place, upon which the bundle of earth's sorrows and sins might securely be suspended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/22-23.htm" title="And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.">Isaiah 22:23-25</a>), the Eliakim of a greater Zion, had the key of the sacred and royal house. In this, the chamber of truth was one treasure, as the chamber of holiness, the chamber of rest, the chamber of spiritual privileges, were others. In other words, though in a sense the keys of spiritual advantages are in the hands of His servants, "He still retains the highest administration of them in His own hands." The power of the keys entrusted to Apostles gave them no right to alter the "essentials of the gospel, or the fundamental principles of morality." The absolution given by them can only be conditional, unless the giver of it possesses the infallible discerning of spirits. The reader of Dante will remember how the cases of Guido di Montefeltro (<span class= "ital">Inf.</span> xxvii.) and of his son Buonconte (<span class= "ital">Purg.</span> v.) illustrate the belief which sustained so many illustrious spirits (John Huss, Savanarola, Dante), and in times of unjust oppression, tyrannical ecclesiasticism, and which this passage sanctions, that<p>"Nought but repentance ever can absolve;<p>And that though sins be horrible; yet so wide arms<p>Hath goodness infinite, that it receives<p>All who turn to it."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-13.</span> - The <span class="accented">epistle to the Church at Philadelphia.</span> The circuit continues in the same direction. Philadelphia lies about thirty miles south-east of Sardis, on the road to Laodicea. It is said to owe its name to <span class="accented">Attalus</span> Philadelphus, King of Pergamum, <span class="date">B.C. 159-138</span>. But it is by no means certain that he was the founder. A trustworthy tradition as to its <span class="accented">Egyptian</span> origin points to <span class="accented">Ptolemy</span> Philadelphus, who had estates in Asia Minor (Theocr., 17:88). Lying at the western edge of a district whose highly volcanic character earned it the name of Phrygia Catacecaumene, Philadelphia was constantly suffering from earthquakes (cf. ver. 12). It was destroyed along with Sardis in the catastrophe of A.D. (Tac., 'Ann.,' 2:47). But the advantages of its position, commanding the way to the pass between the Hermus valley and the Maeander valley, and the richness of its vine produce (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:98), seem to have induced the inhabitants to cling to the site. The coins of Philadelphia often have the head either of Bacchus or a Bacchante on one side; and it is a known fact that volcanic soil is specially favourable to vine growing. Yet in Roman times it was not equal to Ephesus or even Laodicea; and for law courts its citizens had to go to Sardis. Nevertheless, it has outlived all these three, and still continues on the same site, and perhaps within the same walls, as of old. At the close of the fourteenth century it was the last Byzantine city to surrender to the Turks, and, when it did succumb, made better terms than any of the others. To this day it retains the privilege of free Christian worship, with the use of bells for service, and processions in public - a thing allowed by the Turks in no other inland city of Asia Minor. It has a bishop and a dozen churches, and it is said that about a third of its fifteen thousand inhabitants are Christian. Its modern Turkish name is <span class="accented">Allah Shehr</span>, "the city of God," or, as others write and render it, <span class="accented">Ala Shehr</span>, "the striped city." In any case the coincidence with "the name of the city of my God" (ver. 12) is purely accidental. (For an eloquent account of Philadelphia, see Gibbon, 'Decline and Fall,' Revelation 64.) It is doubtful whether there are any local allusions in the epistle; but some have fancied that "thou hast a little power" (ver. 8) and "a pillar in the temple" (ver. 12) are such (see notes in each place). The name of "Little Athens," which Philadelphia sometimes bore, on account of its numerous temples and festivals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-16.htm">Acts 17:16, 22</a>), shows that the little Christian community would have to contend with a specially vigorous form of heathenism. It had also to contend with a colony of hostile Jews, which was no doubt largely augmented after the destruction of Jerusalem, when fugitive Jews came to "worship before the feet" of the Philadelphian Church (ver. 9). Hence the epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians treats of Judaism as one of their chief dangers (c. 6, 8, 9.). There were men among them who questioned the authority of Gospels and Epistles, and admitted only the Old Testament Scriptures (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) as binding. Some had tried to lead even Ignatius himself astray (7.). Altogether his epistle gives a less happy picture of the Philadelphians than that which we have here, where (as in the epistle to the Church at Smyrna) the Philadelphian Church receives unmixed praise. Whether the large proportion of Old Testament language and imagery which is found in this epistle has any connexion with the Jewish colony in Philadelphia is uncertain. Perhaps most of the Christians had been originally Jews. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is holy, he that is true.</span> It is doubtful which of these two clauses should precede: authorities are somewhat evenly balanced. Christ, the Speaker, here claims to be "the Holy One" (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), and therefore God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>). In the Old Testament "the Holy One" is a frequent name of God, especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-5.htm">Jeremiah 51:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a>, etc. The word does not occur in Homer or Hesiod, nor in the Greek tragedians, but is very frequent in the LXX. and the New Testament. Its radical meaning is separation. The two epithets "holy" and "true" must not be merged in one as "the truly holy." The "True One" has a very distinct meaning of its own. Note that the adjective used is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">verax</span>, is "true" as opposed to "lying;" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">verus</span>, is "true" as opposed to "spurious," "unreal," "imperfect." Christ is "the True One" as opposed to the false gods of the heathen; they are spurious gods. Both adjectives, and especially <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, are characteristic of St. John. The latter serves to bind together Gospel, Epistle, and Apocalypse. It occurs nine times in the Gospel, four times in the First Epistle, and ten times in the Apocalypse; twenty-three times in all; in the rest of the New Testament only five times. It is the word used of <span class="accented">"the</span> true Light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-8.htm">1 John 2:8</a> ); <span class="accented">"the</span> true Bread" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32</a>), and "the true Vine" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>). Applied to God, we find it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-29.htm">John 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>. He that hath the key of David. Observe that none of these titles come from the opening vision in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>, although by no means all the material there found (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-16</a>) has been already used. The source of the present appellation is obviously <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20-22</a>; but it is worth noting that <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20</a> has much that is parallel to the unused material in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; so that the opening vision would seem to direct us, as this passage certainly does, to Eliakim as a type of Christ. As Trench observes, Isaiah foretells the promotion of Eliakim "with an emphasis and fulness" which would surprise us if we did not see in it not merely the description of <span class="accented">"a</span> revolution in the royal palace" of Judah, but <span class="accented">"the</span> type of something immeasurably greater." Shebna, whose name shows him to have been a foreigner, had misused his dignity and power as steward or controller of the royal house - an office analogous to that held by Joseph under Pharaoh and by our prime minister. For this he was degraded to the inferior office of royal scribe or secretary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-3.htm">Isaiah 36:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-2.htm">Isaiah 37:2</a>), while Eliakim was made "mayor of the palace" in his room. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the LXX. and <span class="accented">praepositus templi</span> of the Vulgate would lead us to suppose that Eliakim's office was sacerdotal; but this is certainly a mistake. Luther's <span class="accented">Hofmeister is</span> much nearer the mark. A key would not be an appropriate symbol of a priestly office. In possessing "the key of the house of David," Eliakim had control over the house of David. Therefore in this passage Christ claims the control of that of which the house of David was a type. He is Regent in the kingdom of God. <span class="cmt_word">He that openeth, and none shall shut, and shutteth, and none openeth.</span> The various readings here are numerous, but not of much moment: "shall shut" is much better attested than "shutteth" in the first half "The keys of the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>) are not to be confounded with "the key of knowledge" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-52.htm">Luke 11:52</a>). They belong to Christ, but have been committed to his Church, but not unreservedly. "He still retains the highest administration in his own hands" (Trench): and if the Church errs in binding or loosing, he cancels the judgment. The Church may open where Christ will shut, and shut where Christ will open. He alone openeth so that none shall strut, and shutteth so that none can open. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 The same Lord Jesus has the key of government and authority in and over the church. He opens a door of opportunity to his churches; he opens a door of utterance to his ministers; he opens a door of entrance, opens the heart. He shuts the door of heaven against the foolish, who sleep away their day of grace; and against the workers of iniquity, how vain and confident soever they may be. The church in Philadelphia is commended; yet with a gentle reproof. Although Christ accepts a little strength, yet believers must not rest satisfied in a little, but strive to grow in grace, to be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Christ can discover this his favour to his people, so that their enemies shall be forced to acknowledge it. This, by the grace of Christ, will soften their enemies, and make them desire to be admitted into communion with his people. Christ promises preserving grace in the most trying times, as the reward of past faithfulness; To him that hath shall be given. Those who keep the gospel in a time of peace, shall be kept by Christ in an hour of temptation; and the same Divine grace that has made them fruitful in times of peace, will make them faithful in times of persecution. Christ promises a glorious reward to the victorious believer. He shall be a monumental pillar in the temple of God; a monument of the free and powerful grace of God; a monument that shall never be defaced or removed. On this pillar shall be written the new name of Christ; by this will appear, under whom the believer fought the good fight, and came off victorious.</body></html>
