The case of the Sardian Church was bad, yet the loving eyes of the faithful witness would not ignore the good. There were a few who had not defiled their garments. These had not succumbed to the oppressive moral atmosphere around them. The words cannot, of course, be understood of absolute purity. Their praise is that, in the deathlike, self-complacent lethargy around, they had kept earnest in the pursuit of holiness, and had not forgotten Him who could cleanse and revive. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">They shall walk with me in</span> <span class= "bld">white.</span>--This "white" is not the white of the undefiled robe; it is the lustrous white of glory, as in the promise in the following verse. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - But thou hast a few names in Sardis. The "but" (Revised Version) must be added, and the "even" (Authorized Version) omitted, on conclusive evidence. "Names" is here used in the sense of persons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>, where the Revised Version has "persons"); there is no reference to the totally different use of "to have a name" in ver. 1. Bode remarks, "He knoweth his own sheep by name, as he knew Moses by name, and writeth the names of his own in heaven." These few are like the few righteous in Sodom. Though they consent to abide in the Church, they do not leaven it, nor does their presence save it: "They shall deliver but their own souls by their righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 16, 18, 20</a>). The word for "defile" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs only here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>. Its radical meaning is "to besmear," and so "to befoul." That of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a>) is rather "to stain," which is not necessarily "to befoul." That of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-15.htm">Mark 7:15-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-9.htm">Acts 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-28.htm">Acts 21:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13</a>) is "to make common or profane." In most cases all these three are rendered "defile" in our version. These few in Sardis have kept themselves "unspotted from the world" in which they live. Neither the corruption of heathendom nor the torpor of a moribund Church has infected them. Their contact with a dead body has imparted no life to the body and no defilement to them. There is no need to press the metaphor and give a special meaning to "garments" - whether their souls, or their bodies, or their consciences, or their baptismal robes. The metaphor is implied in "putting on the new man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>), "putting on Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>), where the word for "put on" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to be clothed with." They shall walk with me. In accordance with Christ's high-priestly prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>; comp. Roy. 21:24). In white. This elliptical expression (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) for "in white robes" occurs in the New Testament only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>, and is another small link between the two books. The word "white" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), excepting in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-36.htm">Matthew 5:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, is in the New Testament always used of <span class="accented">heavenly</span> purity and brightness. Thus also Plato, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;</span> ('Laws,' 956); and Virgil of the souls in the other world, "Omnibus his hives cinguntur tempora vitta" ('AEneid,' 6:665). (See notes on Revelation 1:14.) As we might expect, the word is specially frequent in Revelation. Of course, the white garments referred to here, vers. 5, 18, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>, are quite different from the undefiled garments just mentioned. The one is the imperfect purity of struggling saints on earth, the other the perfect purity of glorified saints in heaven. The promise, therefore, is threefold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They shall walk, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they shall have life and liberty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They shall have Christ as their constant Companion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> They shall be in unsullied glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And why? <span class="cmt_word">Because they are worthy</span>. The merit is not theirs, but Christ's, in whose blood they have washed their robes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>), and by whose grace they are preserved in holiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>). It is because they have by God's help fulfilled the conditions which he has proraised to accept, that they are worthy. The nearest approach to this declaration of worthiness on the part of God's saints seems to be <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a> (not 21:36) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5, 11</a>. But in all these passages they are "accounted worthy" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) rather than "worthy" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a> we have the opposite worthiness of those who have earned the "wages of sin" instead of the "gift of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Such persons are literally worthy, and not merely accounted worthy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6. The Lord Jesus is He that hath the Holy Spirit with all his powers, graces, and operations. Hypocrisy, and lamentable decay in religion, are sins charged upon Sardis, by One who knew that church well, and all her works. Outward things appeared well to men, but there was only the form of godliness, not the power; a name to live, not a principle of life. There was great deadness in their souls, and in their services; numbers were wholly hypocrites, others were in a disordered and lifeless state. Our Lord called upon them to be watchful against their enemies, and to be active and earnest in their duties; and to endeavour, in dependence on the grace of the Holy Spirit, to revive and strengthen the faith and spiritual affections of those yet alive to God, though in a declining state. Whenever we are off our watch, we lose ground. Thy works are hollow and empty; prayers are not filled up with holy desires, alms-deeds not filled up with true charity, sabbaths not filled up with suitable devotion of soul to God. There are not inward affections suitable to outward acts and expressions; when the spirit is wanting, the form cannot long remain. In seeking a revival in our own souls, or the souls of others, it is needful to compare what we profess with the manner in which we go on, that we may be humbled and quickened to hold fast that which remains. Christ enforces his counsel with a dreadful threatening if it should be despised. Yet our blessed Lord does not leave this sinful people without some encouragement. He makes honourable mention of the faithful remnant in Sardis, he makes a gracious promise to them. He that overcometh shall be clothed in white raiment; the purity of grace shall be rewarded with the perfect purity of glory. Christ has his book of life, a register of all who shall inherit eternal life; the book of remembrance of all who live to God, and keep up the life and power of godliness in evil times. Christ will bring forward this book of life, and show the names of the faithful, before God, and all the angels, at the great day.</body></html>
