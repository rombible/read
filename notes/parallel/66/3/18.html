How could the poor and naked buy? But the irony has no sting, for the counsel but recalled the invitation of the prophet to buy "without money and without price" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Gold</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> golden coin, "tried," or, <span class= "ital">fired out of fire, </span>and so free from alloy or dross. Trench suggests that "gold" here stands for <span class= "ital">faith.</span> Does not, however, the self-deceiving state of this Church rather point to love as the missing grace? The Laodiceans were as those who had many graces in appearance; they were not unlike one who had gifts, tongues, understanding, liberality, but lacked that fervent love without which all was as nothing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.">1Corinthians 13:1-3</a>); or, to use Trench's own image, they were lacking in the only grace accepted as currency in the kingdom of God.<p>"O merchantman at heaven's mart for heavenly ware,<p>Love is the only coin which passes there."<p>But the possession of this love would bring their zeal out of the tepid into the fervent state. Such love, pure and fervent, could only spring from God, who would shed abroad His love in their hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">White raiment.</span>--The putting on of apparel and the stripping of it off were tokens of honour and humiliation.

Self-deceived, they thought, like the Pharisees, that they saw. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/9-40.htm" title="And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said to him, Are we blind also?">John 9:40-41</a>.) Better would it be for them that they should receive the anointing of the Holy One (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1John 2:20</a>), which would teach them all things, and especially reveal to them their self-ignorance. This anointing might be painful, but "the eyes of their understanding would be enlightened" (such is the remarkably parallel thought in the Epistle to the Ephesians), and they would be enabled to see and appreciate things spiritual. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.">John 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-25.htm" title="He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.">John 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.">1Corinthians 2:10-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-19.htm" title="Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;">Ephesians 5:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich;</span> <span class="accented">gold refined by the fire</span> (Revised Version). It is doubtful whether ver. 17 should be connected with ver. 18 or with ver. 16 - whether the self-satisfied condition of the Church is given as the reason why "I will spue thee out of my mouth," or as the reason why "I counsel thee to buy of me." The Revised Version follows the Authorized Version in connecting yore. 17 and 18; and this view is supported by Alford, Bengel, Dusterdieck, Ebrard. But Trench prefers the other view. The Authorized Version seems correct, for the reason why "I will spue thee" is given in ver. 16, and another separate reason would probably (though not certainly) not be added. Though St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>) had pointed out to the Laodiceans (see on the epistle generally, vers. 14-22; and el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>) where "are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," they had not heeded the lesson, and now Christ once more counsels them to obtain true riches from the proper source. They are to buy <span class="accented">from me</span>; the emphasis being laid on <span class="accented">me</span>, in contradistinction to their trust in themselves. They are <span class="accented">poor</span> (ver. 17), and must therefore obtain <span class="accented">gold refined by the fire -</span> gold superior to that on the possession of which they so prided themselves, that they may indeed <span class="accented">be rich. To buy</span> this gold by giving something of equal value in exchange, they were truly unable. Yet it was to be bought, and would entail the sacrifice of something which, though perhaps dear to them, would be nothing in comparison with the return they would obtain. Note the Revised Version rendering <span class="accented">may become rich</span>, repeating and enforcing the fact of their present destitution. <span class="cmt_word">And white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed</span>. Laodicea is said to have been famous for the raven blackness of the wool which was prepared and dyed there. This, perhaps, explains the point of the reproof contained in these words. "Notwithstanding thy trust in the excellence of the apparel for which thou aft famous, thou art yet naked (ver. 17), and needest clothing; that clothing can be obtained only from me, and is far superior to that of which thou boastest, since it is <span class="accented">white</span>, the emblem of all that is purest and best; not black, like your own, which is a type of darkness, the darkness of ignorance and sin. Mine is indeed the garment of righteousness, the marriage garment with which thou mayest enter the presence of thy King." <span class="cmt_word">And that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear</span>. The nakedness will certainly be made apparent at some time. If it be persistently overlooked or ignored now, it will be made more glaring in the future, when God turns upon it the brightness of his presence. In the Revised Version "appear" is even more emphatically rendered "be made manifest" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). "Stripping," in the Bible, is commonly used to denote putting to shame: Hanun cut off the garments of David's servants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>); the King of Assyria was to lead away the Egyptians naked and barefoot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>); while supplying with clothes, or an additional quantity of clothes, was intended to show honour: thus Pharaoh arrayed Joseph in vestures of fine linen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>); Joseph gave Benjamin five changes of raiment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-9.htm">Esther 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-4.htm">Zechariah 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>). And anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. This is, of course, a reference in the "blindness" of ver. 17, of which the Laodiceans were ignorant. "Eyesalve" is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c8;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;</span>, perhaps so called because made up in the shape of a cake of bread - <span class="accented">collyra.</span> We cannot but think, in connexion with this passage, of the miracle of the healing of the blind man by the anointing of his eyes by our Lord - a miracle witnessed and related by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9.htm">John 9</a>.). The subsequent incidents and discourse, too, forcibly illustrate the state of the Laodiceans, so much like that of the Pharisees, to whom were addressed the words, "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin; but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth" (see on ver. 15). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-22 Laodicea was the last and worst of the seven churches of Asia. Here our Lord Jesus styles himself, The Amen; one steady and unchangeable in all his purposes and promises. If religion is worth anything, it is worth every thing. Christ expects men should be in earnest. How many professors of gospel doctrine are neither hot nor cold; except as they are indifferent in needful matters, and hot and fiery in disputes about things of lesser moment! A severe punishment is threatened. They would give a false opinion of Christianity, as if it were an unholy religion; while others would conclude it could afford no real satisfaction, otherwise its professors would not have been heartless in it, or so ready to seek pleasure or happiness from the world. One cause of this indifference and inconsistency in religion is, self-conceit and self-delusion; Because thou sayest. What a difference between their thoughts of themselves, and the thoughts Christ had of them! How careful should we be not to cheat our owns souls! There are many in hell, who once thought themselves far in the way to heaven. Let us beg of God that we may not be left to flatter and deceive ourselves. Professors grow proud, as they become carnal and formal. Their state was wretched in itself. They were poor; really poor, when they said and thought they were rich. They could not see their state, nor their way, nor their danger, yet they thought they saw it. They had not the garment of justification, nor sanctification: they were exposed to sin and shame; their rags that would defile them. They were naked, without house or harbour, for they were without God, in whom alone the soul of man can find rest and safety. Good counsel was given by Christ to this sinful people. Happy those who take his counsel, for all others must perish in their sins. Christ lets them know where they might have true riches, and how they might have them. Some things must be parted with, but nothing valuable; and it is only to make room for receiving true riches. Part with sin and self-confidence, that you may be filled with his hidden treasure. They must receive from Christ the white raiment he purchased and provided for them; his own imputed righteousness for justification, and the garments of holiness and sanctification. Let them give themselves up to his word and Spirit, and their eyes shall be opened to see their way and their end. Let us examine ourselves by the rule of his word, and pray earnestly for the teaching of his Holy Spirit, to take away our pride, prejudices, and worldly lusts. Sinners ought to take the rebukes of God's word and rod, as tokens of his love to their souls. Christ stood without; knocking, by the dealings of his providence, the warnings and teaching of his word, and the influences of his Spirit. Christ still graciously, by his word and Spirit, comes to the door of the hearts of sinners. Those who open to him shall enjoy his presence. If what he finds would make but a poor feast, what he brings will supply a rich one. He will give fresh supplies of graces and comforts. In the conclusion is a promise to the overcoming believer. Christ himself had temptations and conflicts; he overcame them all, and was more than a conqueror. Those made like to Christ in his trials, shall be made like to him in glory. All is closed with the general demand of attention. And these counsels, while suited to the churches to which they were addressed, are deeply interesting to all men.</body></html>
