It received its name from Laodice, wife of Antiochus the second king of Syria, by whom it was rebuilt and beautified. It had borne in earlier times the names of Diospolis and afterwards Rhoas. It shared with Thyatira and Sardis in the dye trade; the woods grown in the neighbourhood were famous for their quality and the rich blackness of their colour. Prosperity in trade had so enriched the population that when their city suffered in the great earthquake (A.D. 60) they were able to carry on the work of rebuilding without applying, as many of the neighbouring towns were compelled to do, to the Imperial Treasury for aid. The language of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;">Colossians 1:5-8</a>) suggests that the churches of Colossae and the neighbourhood first received Christianity from the preaching of Epaphras, though it seems strange that so important a city, lying hard upon the great Roman road from Ephesus to the east, should have been passed over by St. Paul in his journeyings throughout Phrygia (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>); yet, on the other hand, Phrygia was a vague term, and the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a> is most generally understood to imply that the Apostle had never personally visited either Colossae or Laodicea. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>.) But it was a Church in which St. Paul took the deepest possible interest; the believers there were constantly in his mind. He knew their special temptations to the worship of inferior mediators, and to spiritual paralysis springing from wordly prosperity and intellectual pride. He had great heart-conflict for those of Laodicea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>), and in proof of his earnest solicitude he addressed a letter to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-16.htm" title=" And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the letter from Laodicea.">Colossians 4:16</a>), in all probability the epistle we call the Epistle to the Ephesians. Prom the Epistle to the Colossians we may gather that when St. Paul wrote the Christians at Laodicea assembled for worship in the house of Nymphas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-15.htm" title=" Salute the brothers which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.">Colossians 4:15</a>) probably under the presidency of Archippus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-17.htm" title="Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:">Revelation 3:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Unto the angel of the church </span>(or, <span class= "ital">congregation) </span><span class= "bld">of the Laodiceans.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in Laodicea.</span> By the angel we understand the presiding pastor. There is some ground for identifying him with Archippus. It is too much to dismiss this as a baseless supposition. (See Note in Trench.) It is a well-supported view which understands the passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-17.htm" title=" And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.">Colossians 4:17</a>) to mean that Archippus was a minister or office-bearer in the Church at Laodicea.<p><span class= "bld">These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness.--</span>The "Amen," used only here as a personal name. It is the Hebrew word for verily, and may have some reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm" title="That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.">Isaiah 65:16</a>; but more certainly it seems chosen to recall the frequent use of it by our Lord Himself. He who so often prefaced His solemn utterance by "Verily, verily," now reveals Himself as the source of all certainty and truth. In Him is Yea, and in Him Amen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.">2Corinthians 1:20</a>). In Him there is no conjecture, or guess-work; for He is (and the Greek equivalents of the Hebrew Amen are used following) the faithful and true witness, who speaks what He <span class= "ital">knows</span>, and testifies what He has <span class= "ital">seen </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.">John 3:11</a>). "Faithful" is to be taken here as meaning trustworthy. The word sometimes means trustful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm" title="Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.">John 20:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.">Acts 14:1</a>), at other times, trustworthy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm" title="Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.">2Timothy 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm" title="Faithful is he that calls you, who also will do it.">1Thessalonians 5:24</a>). In the Arian controversy, the application of the word to Christ was used as an argument against His divinity; it was enough to show in reply that the same word was applied to God, and expressed His faithfulness to His word and promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" title="Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.">1Thessalonians 5:21</a>). "True"--He is not only trustworthy as a witness, but He combines in Himself all those qualifications which a witness ought to possess. The same word is used here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things said he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;">Revelation 3:7</a>, where see Note. Trench suggests the three things necessary to constitute a true witness. He must have been an eyewitness of what He relates, possess competence to relate what He has seen, and be willing to do so.<p><span class= "bld">The beginning </span>(better, <span class= "ital">the origination)</span> <span class= "bld">of the creation of God.</span>--This title of our Lord does not occur in the Epistles to the other churches, but very closely resembles the language used by St. Paul in writing to the Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15-18</a>). The "beginning," not meaning that Christ was the first among the created, but that He was the origination, or <span class= "ital">primary source</span> of all creation. By Him were all things made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1-3</a> : comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>), not <span class= "ital">with</span> Him, but <span class= "ital">by</span> Him creation began. In short, the word "beginning" (like the word "faithful") must be understood in an active sense. He has originating power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm" title="But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;">Acts 3:14</a>) as well as priority of existence. The appropriateness of its use will be seen when we remember that the Laodicean Church was exposed to the temptation of worshipping inferior principalities. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>, where the plural of the word here rendered "beginning," or <span class= "ital">origin</span>, is used, and is translated "principalities.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-22.</span> - The <span class="accented">epistle to the Church in Laodicea.</span> Laodicea, on the Lycus, a tributary of the Maeander, lay some fifty miles to the south-east of Philadelphia. The modern Turkish name, <span class="accented">Eskihissar</span>, signifies "the old castle." It is situated on the western side of the valley of the Lycus, on the opposite slopes of which, some six or eight miles distant, were Hierapolis and Colossae, with which it is associated by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13, 16</a>). Named at first Diosopolis, after its tutelary deity, Zeus, it subsequently became Rheas, and finally received its name from Antiochus II., in honour of his wife, Laodice. There were several other cities of the same name, from which it was distinguished by the addition of the words, "on the Lycus." It was a wealthy city, its trade consisting chiefly in the preparation of woollen materials. It was advantageously situated, too, on the high road leading from Ephesus into the interior. Though, in common with the other cities of Asia Minor, visited by earthquakes, it quickly recovered; and it was the proud boast of the Laodiceans that, unlike Ephesus and Sardis, they required no extraneous assistance to enable them to regain their former prosperity. This fact undoubtedly explains the temptations to which the Laodiceans were liable, and the reference in ver. 16 to those who were neither cold nor hot, and that in ver. 17 to those who said they were rich and had need of nothing (see on vers. 16, 17). The Christian Church there may have been founded by Epaphras, through whom St. Paul probably learned of the existence of false doctrine there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4, 8</a> and Colossians 1:8), for the Epistle to the Colossians seems to be equally addressed to the Laodiceans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>). The importance of this Church continued for some time, the celebrated Council of Laodicea being held there in A.D. , and a century later its bishop held a prominent position (Labbe, 4. p. 82, etc.). But its influence gradually waned, and the Turks pressed hardly upon it; so that at the present time it is little more than a heap of ruins. The warnings of the Apostles SS. Paul and John, if heeded at all for a time, were forgotten, and her candlestick was removed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And unto the angel</span>. Those expositors who understand "the angel" of a Church to signify its chief officer, may with some plausibility argue that at Laodicea it seems almost certain that this was Archippus. In his Epistle to Philemon, a wealthy convert of Colossae, St. Paul sends greeting to Archippus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>). If Archippus were the son of philemon, he might very well have been Bishop of Laodicea at the time of St. John's message. Moreover, the son of a wealthy and influential Christian, though likely to have been selected as bishop in the neighbouring Church, may have lacked the zeal necessary for the thorough performance of his work; and would thus incur the marked rebuke of St. Paul, "Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a>), which appears immediately after the mention of the Laodicean Church. The Apostolical Constitutions also assert that Archippus was first Bishop of Laodicea. Of the Church of the Laodiceans write; or, <span class="accented">of the Church in Laodicea</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). These things saith the Amen. The word "Amen" is here used as a proper name of our Lord; and this is the only instance of such an application. It signifies the "True One." It is a word much used in St. John's Gospel, where it appears repeated at the commencement of many discourses, "Verily, verily." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a> "the God of Amen" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>) is rendered in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; in the Authorized Version by "truth" (cf. the use of the English "very" as an adjective - "the <span class="accented">very</span> one," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="accented">real</span> or <span class="accented">true</span> one). The term is peculiarly well adapted to our Lord (who is the <span class="accented">Truth</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), not only as a general name or title, but especially in connexion with this solemn announcement to the Laodiceans. There was great need of the truth being openly proclaimed by him who is the Truth to those who, though nominally Christians, were ensnared by the <span class="accented">deceitfulness of riches</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>), and were deceiving themselves in the attempt to make the best of both worlds by their lukewarm Christianity. It was the purpose of this epistle to draw aside the veil which was hiding the truth from their eyes, and to bring them to a realization of that most difficult of all knowledge - a knowledge of self. The faithful and true Witness - an amplification of "the Amen." The epithet "faithful" asserts the truthfulness of Christ's work as a Witness; "true" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) signifies "real and complete." He is <span class="accented">a faithful</span> Witness because his witness is true; and he is a true Witness because in him is the complete realization of all the qualifications which constitute any one really and truly a witness. "Faithful" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) has the passive meaning of "that which is worthy of faith," not the active meaning of "he who believes something." Trench well points out that God can only be <span class="accented">faithful in</span> the former sense; man may <span class="accented">be faithful</span> in beth senses. Christ was a Witness worthy of faith, since he possessed all the attributes of such a witness. He <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> had seen what he attested; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> was competent to relate and reproduce this information; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> was willing to do this faithfully and truly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Beginning of the creation of God. There are two ways in which these words might be understood: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that in which "beginning" is taken in a passive sense, and which would therefore make Christ the first created thing of all the things which God created; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the active sense, by which Christ is described as the Beginner, the Author, Moving Principle or Source of all the things which God created. That the latter meaning is the true one is plain from the whole tenor of Holy Scripture. The Ariaus, attempting to disprove the Divinity of our Lord, quoted this passage, attributing to it the former sense. But <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is often used actively, and may well be so used here - a view which is confirmed by the abundant evidence of our Lord's Divinity found elsewhere in the Bible, and nowhere more plainly asserted than in the writings of St. John. The self-reliant Laodiceans are thus directed to place their trust in him who is the Source of all things, rather than in those created things of which he is the Creator. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:14-22 Laodicea was the last and worst of the seven churches of Asia. Here our Lord Jesus styles himself, The Amen; one steady and unchangeable in all his purposes and promises. If religion is worth anything, it is worth every thing. Christ expects men should be in earnest. How many professors of gospel doctrine are neither hot nor cold; except as they are indifferent in needful matters, and hot and fiery in disputes about things of lesser moment! A severe punishment is threatened. They would give a false opinion of Christianity, as if it were an unholy religion; while others would conclude it could afford no real satisfaction, otherwise its professors would not have been heartless in it, or so ready to seek pleasure or happiness from the world. One cause of this indifference and inconsistency in religion is, self-conceit and self-delusion; Because thou sayest. What a difference between their thoughts of themselves, and the thoughts Christ had of them! How careful should we be not to cheat our owns souls! There are many in hell, who once thought themselves far in the way to heaven. Let us beg of God that we may not be left to flatter and deceive ourselves. Professors grow proud, as they become carnal and formal. Their state was wretched in itself. They were poor; really poor, when they said and thought they were rich. They could not see their state, nor their way, nor their danger, yet they thought they saw it. They had not the garment of justification, nor sanctification: they were exposed to sin and shame; their rags that would defile them. They were naked, without house or harbour, for they were without God, in whom alone the soul of man can find rest and safety. Good counsel was given by Christ to this sinful people. Happy those who take his counsel, for all others must perish in their sins. Christ lets them know where they might have true riches, and how they might have them. Some things must be parted with, but nothing valuable; and it is only to make room for receiving true riches. Part with sin and self-confidence, that you may be filled with his hidden treasure. They must receive from Christ the white raiment he purchased and provided for them; his own imputed righteousness for justification, and the garments of holiness and sanctification. Let them give themselves up to his word and Spirit, and their eyes shall be opened to see their way and their end. Let us examine ourselves by the rule of his word, and pray earnestly for the teaching of his Holy Spirit, to take away our pride, prejudices, and worldly lusts. Sinners ought to take the rebukes of God's word and rod, as tokens of his love to their souls. Christ stood without; knocking, by the dealings of his providence, the warnings and teaching of his word, and the influences of his Spirit. Christ still graciously, by his word and Spirit, comes to the door of the hearts of sinners. Those who open to him shall enjoy his presence. If what he finds would make but a poor feast, what he brings will supply a rich one. He will give fresh supplies of graces and comforts. In the conclusion is a promise to the overcoming believer. Christ himself had temptations and conflicts; he overcame them all, and was more than a conqueror. Those made like to Christ in his trials, shall be made like to him in glory. All is closed with the general demand of attention. And these counsels, while suited to the churches to which they were addressed, are deeply interesting to all men.</body></html>
