The further expectation is to hold fast, or keep--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as an abiding habit. It has been noticed that this counsel is identical with that given to Timothy to "keep the good thing which had been committed to his charge" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-14.htm" title="That good thing which was committed to you keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us.">2Timothy 1:14</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-2.htm" title="And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.">2Timothy 2:2</a>). "Repent" is the closing word; combined with the exhortation to hold fast, it reminds us that formal tenacity of truth and a fruitless inactive regret are alike useless. There must be the sorrow for the past, and a sorrow which shows itself in action--a repentance whereby sin is forsaken. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-5.htm" title="Remember therefore from where you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of his place, except you repent.">Revelation 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-21.htm" title="And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.">Revelation 2:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">If therefore thou shalt not watch.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">If thou shalt not watch</span> (or, <span class= "ital">have been awake</span>)<span class= "ital">, I will come</span> (omit "on thee") <span class= "ital">as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</span> The warning is an echo from the Gospels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-42.htm" title="Watch therefore: for you know not what hour your Lord does come.">Matthew 24:42-43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-39.htm" title="And this know, that if the manager of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.">Luke 12:39-40</a>). The coming of Christ to judge His Church would be in an hour unlooked for. What kind of hour He would so come was' unknown; the sound of His approaching footsteps unheard. Shod with wool, according to the ancient proverb, stealthily as a thief, the Judge would be at the door. Yet they could not plead that they had been in darkness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" title="But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.">1Thessalonians 5:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember therefore how thou hast received and didst hear</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>). Like the Ephesians, the Sardians are reminded of the better condition from which they have receded. They are of those "who, when they have heard the Word, straightway receive it with joy; and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-16.htm">Mark 4:16, 17</a>). The "how," as is shown by the verbs "receive" and "hear," refers to the readiness with which they accepted the gospel, rather than to the power with which it was preached to them. The tenses are instructive: the aorist applies to the hearing at some definite period in their history; the perfect implies the permanent result of the act of reception. Keep and repent. Keep what thou didst hear. "Keep" is better than "hold fast," to mark the difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3, 8, 10</a>, etc.), and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1, 13, 14, 15, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>, etc.). Here again the tenses should be noted: the present imperative indicates that they are to <span class="accented">continue</span> to keep; the aorist, that they are to repent <span class="accented">once for all.</span> We have a similar combination of tenses in" Take these things hence at once; continue to refrain from making my Father's house a house of merchandise" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-34.htm">1 Corinthians 15:34</a>). "Remember" here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a> is with equal fitness the present imperative: "continue to remember." I will come as a thief. The "on thee" after "come," though well supported, is probably not genuine. Wherever this figure is used in the New Testament of the coming of Christ, the word used is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "a thief," and not <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, a "robber" or "bandit." This shows, what is also plain from the context, that secrecy, not violence, is the point of the similitude (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). Thou shalt not know what hour; literally, <span class="accented">thou shalt in no wise come to know during what kind of an hour.</span> The negative is the strongest form, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5, 12</a>). The verb is <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which implies acquisition of knowledge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>). The pronoun is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm">John 10:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-33.htm">John 12:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-32.htm">John 18:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-19.htm">John 21:19</a>; and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>); and "hour" is in the accusative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-52.htm">John 4:52</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6. The Lord Jesus is He that hath the Holy Spirit with all his powers, graces, and operations. Hypocrisy, and lamentable decay in religion, are sins charged upon Sardis, by One who knew that church well, and all her works. Outward things appeared well to men, but there was only the form of godliness, not the power; a name to live, not a principle of life. There was great deadness in their souls, and in their services; numbers were wholly hypocrites, others were in a disordered and lifeless state. Our Lord called upon them to be watchful against their enemies, and to be active and earnest in their duties; and to endeavour, in dependence on the grace of the Holy Spirit, to revive and strengthen the faith and spiritual affections of those yet alive to God, though in a declining state. Whenever we are off our watch, we lose ground. Thy works are hollow and empty; prayers are not filled up with holy desires, alms-deeds not filled up with true charity, sabbaths not filled up with suitable devotion of soul to God. There are not inward affections suitable to outward acts and expressions; when the spirit is wanting, the form cannot long remain. In seeking a revival in our own souls, or the souls of others, it is needful to compare what we profess with the manner in which we go on, that we may be humbled and quickened to hold fast that which remains. Christ enforces his counsel with a dreadful threatening if it should be despised. Yet our blessed Lord does not leave this sinful people without some encouragement. He makes honourable mention of the faithful remnant in Sardis, he makes a gracious promise to them. He that overcometh shall be clothed in white raiment; the purity of grace shall be rewarded with the perfect purity of glory. Christ has his book of life, a register of all who shall inherit eternal life; the book of remembrance of all who live to God, and keep up the life and power of godliness in evil times. Christ will bring forward this book of life, and show the names of the faithful, before God, and all the angels, at the great day.</body></html>
