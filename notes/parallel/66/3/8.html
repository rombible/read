Once more Christ's judgment is based upon intimate personal knowledge. A question arises whether the next sentence, introduced by "behold," should be parenthetical or not. It is possible, as in the Authorized Version and previous English versions, and also in the Vulgate, to avoid what is certainly an awkward parenthesis. On the other hand, it seems clear that in ver. 1 and ver. 15 <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> depends upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, "I know thy works, <span class="accented">that</span> thou," and does not introduce a fresh sentence; "I know thy works: <span class="accented">for</span> thou." Then must not <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> depend upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> here? But either arrangement makes good sense, and perhaps the omission of the parenthesis makes the best sense: <span class="accented">"Because</span> thou hast little power, and hast made a good use of that little, I have given thee an opportunity of which none shall deprive thee." This seems to be the obvious meaning of the"opened door," in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>. The Philadelphian Church, in spite of its small advantages, whether in numbers or prosperity, kept Christ's word when called upon to deny him; and for this it shall ever have the privilege of giving others an entrance into Christ's fold. The aorists, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, appear to point to some definite occasion. On "keep my word," see notes on Revelation 1:3 and Revelation 2:26. The antithetic parallelism, "didst keep and didst not deny," is thoroughly in St. John's style, and is one of many instances of the Hebrew cast of his language (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm">Revelation 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-5.htm">John 10:5, 18</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 10, 11, 27, 28</a>).

Such frequent solecisms argue imperfect grasp of the language (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-25.htm">Mark 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-17.htm">Acts 15:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 The same Lord Jesus has the key of government and authority in and over the church. He opens a door of opportunity to his churches; he opens a door of utterance to his ministers; he opens a door of entrance, opens the heart. He shuts the door of heaven against the foolish, who sleep away their day of grace; and against the workers of iniquity, how vain and confident soever they may be. The church in Philadelphia is commended; yet with a gentle reproof. Although Christ accepts a little strength, yet believers must not rest satisfied in a little, but strive to grow in grace, to be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Christ can discover this his favour to his people, so that their enemies shall be forced to acknowledge it. This, by the grace of Christ, will soften their enemies, and make them desire to be admitted into communion with his people. Christ promises preserving grace in the most trying times, as the reward of past faithfulness; To him that hath shall be given. Those who keep the gospel in a time of peace, shall be kept by Christ in an hour of temptation; and the same Divine grace that has made them fruitful in times of peace, will make them faithful in times of persecution. Christ promises a glorious reward to the victorious believer. He shall be a monumental pillar in the temple of God; a monument of the free and powerful grace of God; a monument that shall never be defaced or removed. On this pillar shall be written the new name of Christ; by this will appear, under whom the believer fought the good fight, and came off victorious.</body></html>
