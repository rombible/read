The use of the present participle instead of an adjective ("watching!" for "watchful") makes the charge more definite; not merely "be of a watchful character," but "become a watcher" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-4.htm">Mark 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Stablish the things that remain, which were ready to die.</span> The reading, "were ready to die," is the best attested, and as being less smooth than "are ready to die," was more likely to be altered. It anticipates the time when the command will be obeyed: "which were ready to die when thou didst begin to stablish them." No doubt <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;</span> may be masculine in signification, and mean those members of the Church who have still some life in them. But this interpretation anticipates ver. 4, which apparently introduces a new fact. It seems better, therefore, to retain the neuter, and interpret "the things that remain" as meaning the few good elements of faith and practice which still survived. The externals of the Christian life were there; otherwise it could not have been even nominally Christian. And these externals might be made realities to support the revived life of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">For I have found no works of thine</span>. The difference between the Authorized Version and the Revised Version here depends upon the presence or absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>. The balance of probability is against <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, and its absence makes the reproach stronger. <span class="cmt_word">Fulfilled before my God</span>. The substitution of "fulfilled" (Revised Version) for "perfect" (Authorized Version) is important. The Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm">John 16:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-13.htm">John 17:13</a>, etc.), not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>). And "fulfilled" is better than "complete" (Alford, Tregelles), in order to bring out the connexion with the numerous places in which the same verb occurs, especially in the writings of St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-8.htm">John 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11, 25</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a> 2John 12); in many of which passages "complete" would not stand as a rendering. "Fulfilled," or" made full," means made up to the right standard of excellence. The works of the Sardian Church have been weighed, and found wanting before God. "A minister of Christ is very often in highest honour with men for the performance of one half of his work, while God is regarding him with displeasure for the neglect of the other half." "Before <span class="accented">my</span> God" is undoubtedly the true reading, whatever may be the case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>. Only in the writings of St. John does Jesus Christ speak of the Father as "my God;" and this fact is one more link between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. In this chapter we have five instances - here and ver. 12 (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a> [possibly] and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a> Christ adopts the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, and addresses the Father as" my God;" and St. Paul uses similar language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>). The expression, "before God" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), is specially common in the Apocalypse and in the writings of St. Luke and of St. Paul; it does not occur in either St. Matthew or St. Mark. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6. The Lord Jesus is He that hath the Holy Spirit with all his powers, graces, and operations. Hypocrisy, and lamentable decay in religion, are sins charged upon Sardis, by One who knew that church well, and all her works. Outward things appeared well to men, but there was only the form of godliness, not the power; a name to live, not a principle of life. There was great deadness in their souls, and in their services; numbers were wholly hypocrites, others were in a disordered and lifeless state. Our Lord called upon them to be watchful against their enemies, and to be active and earnest in their duties; and to endeavour, in dependence on the grace of the Holy Spirit, to revive and strengthen the faith and spiritual affections of those yet alive to God, though in a declining state. Whenever we are off our watch, we lose ground. Thy works are hollow and empty; prayers are not filled up with holy desires, alms-deeds not filled up with true charity, sabbaths not filled up with suitable devotion of soul to God. There are not inward affections suitable to outward acts and expressions; when the spirit is wanting, the form cannot long remain. In seeking a revival in our own souls, or the souls of others, it is needful to compare what we profess with the manner in which we go on, that we may be humbled and quickened to hold fast that which remains. Christ enforces his counsel with a dreadful threatening if it should be despised. Yet our blessed Lord does not leave this sinful people without some encouragement. He makes honourable mention of the faithful remnant in Sardis, he makes a gracious promise to them. He that overcometh shall be clothed in white raiment; the purity of grace shall be rewarded with the perfect purity of glory. Christ has his book of life, a register of all who shall inherit eternal life; the book of remembrance of all who live to God, and keep up the life and power of godliness in evil times. Christ will bring forward this book of life, and show the names of the faithful, before God, and all the angels, at the great day.</body></html>
