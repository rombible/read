On this glistering appearance comp. Dante's words, "robed in hue of living flame," and the description so frequent in the <span class= "ital">Pilgrim's Progress</span>--"the shining ones." Trench, who reminds us that this glistening white is found in the symbolism of heathen antiquity, says: "The glorified body, defecated of all its dregs and impurities, whatever remained of those having been <span class= "ital">precipitated</span> in death, and now transformed and transfigured into the likeness of Christ's body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a>), this, with its robe, atmosphere, and effluence of lights, is itself, I believe, the white raiment which Christ here promises to His redeemed." Professor Lightfoot thinks (see his <span class= "ital">Epistle to Col.</span> p. 22) that there may be a reference to the purple dyes for which Sardis, as well as Thyatira, was celebrated.<p><span class= "bld">I will not blot out . . .</span>--The negative is emphatic, "I will in no wise blot out." This figure of speech--a book and the blotting out--was ancient.

The name shall not be erased from the roll or register of the citizens of heaven. "A process of erasure is ever going on, besides the process of entering. When the soul has finally taken its choice for evil, when Christ is utterly denied on earth and trodden under foot, when the defilement of sin has become inveterate and indelible, then the pen is drawn through the guilty name, then the inverted style smears the wax over the unworthy characters; and when the owner of that name applies afterwards for admittance, the answer is, 'I know thee not; depart hence, thou willing worker and lover of iniquity'" (Dr. Vaughan).<p><span class= "bld">But I will confess his name.</span>--Another echo of Christ's words on earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-32.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 10:32-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-8.htm" title="Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:">Luke 12:8-9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed in white garments</span>. It is difficult to see on what principles of criticism Alford retains the reading of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, instead of that rightly accepted by the Revisers, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. The latter has a very decided balance of external evidence in its favour; the former is a corruption very likely to occur either accidentally or in order to introduce a construction very frequent in St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-18.htm">John 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-9.htm">2 John 1:9</a>). The change from "clothed" (Authorized Version) to "arrayed" (Revised Version) here and elsewhere is no doubt made in order to mark the difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. But neither the Authorized Version (John 17:4; 19:8) nor the Revised Version (John 11:3; 15:6) is consistent. The Authorized Version generally renders both words "clothed." The Revised Version generally has "arrayed" for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and "clothed" for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Authorized Version is singularly capricious in having "garments" for <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 4, and "raiment" for the same word in ver. 5. The construction, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>, and once or twice in the LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>); the usual construction is with the accusative. The promise in this verse is again threefold, the last of the three promises in ver. 4 being repeated here as the first in this triplet. Repetitions of a similar kind are very frequent in the Fourth Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9, 16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I will in no wise blot out his name</span>. The negative, as in vers. 3 and 12, is in the strongest form. Here we seem to have a figure borrowed from the custom of striking the names of the dead out of the list of citizens. But the figure is a very ancient one, as is seen from parallels in the Old Testament. The present passage, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> is singularly close to the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; and to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-33.htm">Exodus 32:33</a>, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; and for the exact expression, "the book of life," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; and (without articles) <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, where Bishop Lightfoot comments as follows: "The 'book of life' in the figurative language of the Old Testament is the register of the covenant people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a>). Hence 'to be blotted out of the book of the living' means 'to forfeit the privileges of the theocracy, to be shut out from God's favour.' But the expression, though perhaps confined originally to temporal blessings, was in itself a witness to higher hopes; and in the Book of Daniel first it distinctly refers to a blessed immortality (comp. Hermas, 'Vis.,' 1:3; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-23.htm">Hebrews 12:23</a>)? And I will confess his name. Without the smallest manuscript authority or any encouragement from previous versions, Latin, German, or English, the Genevan and Authorized Versions here render <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> "but"! The simple connexion with "and" is thoroughly in St. John's style: "He shall be... <span class="accented">and</span> I will... <span class="accented">and</span> I will" (comp. vers. 12, 17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26-28</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 5, 10, 11, 14</a>, etc.). This is the third of the promises: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> he shall be in unsullied glory; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> he shall never lose his heavenly citizenship; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he shall be publicly acknowledged as a citizen by the Judge. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This third point is a combination of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a> ("before my Father") with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8</a> ("before the angels of God"). "We may observe of this epistle that in great part it is woven together of sayings which the Lord had already uttered in the days during which he pitched his tent among men; he is now setting his seal from heaven upon his words uttered on earth" (Trench). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-6. The Lord Jesus is He that hath the Holy Spirit with all his powers, graces, and operations. Hypocrisy, and lamentable decay in religion, are sins charged upon Sardis, by One who knew that church well, and all her works. Outward things appeared well to men, but there was only the form of godliness, not the power; a name to live, not a principle of life. There was great deadness in their souls, and in their services; numbers were wholly hypocrites, others were in a disordered and lifeless state. Our Lord called upon them to be watchful against their enemies, and to be active and earnest in their duties; and to endeavour, in dependence on the grace of the Holy Spirit, to revive and strengthen the faith and spiritual affections of those yet alive to God, though in a declining state. Whenever we are off our watch, we lose ground. Thy works are hollow and empty; prayers are not filled up with holy desires, alms-deeds not filled up with true charity, sabbaths not filled up with suitable devotion of soul to God. There are not inward affections suitable to outward acts and expressions; when the spirit is wanting, the form cannot long remain. In seeking a revival in our own souls, or the souls of others, it is needful to compare what we profess with the manner in which we go on, that we may be humbled and quickened to hold fast that which remains. Christ enforces his counsel with a dreadful threatening if it should be despised. Yet our blessed Lord does not leave this sinful people without some encouragement. He makes honourable mention of the faithful remnant in Sardis, he makes a gracious promise to them. He that overcometh shall be clothed in white raiment; the purity of grace shall be rewarded with the perfect purity of glory. Christ has his book of life, a register of all who shall inherit eternal life; the book of remembrance of all who live to God, and keep up the life and power of godliness in evil times. Christ will bring forward this book of life, and show the names of the faithful, before God, and all the angels, at the great day.</body></html>
