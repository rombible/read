Men will seek for death in vain; they will long to die, and lo ! death is seen fleeing from them. We can see an age in which death will be regarded as a sweet respite from the tormenting trials of life: men will stretch out their hands to death as to a welcome deliverer; but behold! death is seen fleeing from them. The word translated "desire" in our English version is a strong word; it has been rendered <span class= "ital">vehemently desire:</span> it is a passionate longing, as the yearning of the soul after one we love. There have been ages in which men have thus pined for death, in which light and life seem but mockeries to the miserable, and men "long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/3-20.htm" title="Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul;">Job 3:20-21</a>). Such times are those which have been well called reigns of terror.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them;</span> <span class="accented">shall in no wise find it</span>... <span class="accented">and death fleeth from them</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "the men;" that is, the unsealed, who suffer this judgment. This is a characteristic biblical method of expressing great anguish. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20, 21</a>, "The bitter in soul; which long for death, but it cometh not" (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-3.htm">Jeremiah 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm">Job 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>). The description portrays great anguish of mind, and should not be pressed to a literal interpretation, though many have illustrated the passage by pointing to actual occurrences of the kind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Upon sounding the fifth trumpet, a star fell from heaven to the earth. Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by this star becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers of hell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomless pit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs by blinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, and promoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm of locusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition, idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the true believers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But a secret poison and infection in the soul, should rob many others of purity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt those who had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace will keep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited to a short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithful share the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they might and would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were to try and prove the Christians, 1Co 11:19. And early writers plainly refer this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread the Christian church.</body></html>
