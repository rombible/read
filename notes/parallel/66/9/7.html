The resemblance is more distinct when the horses are made ready for battle: the hard shell or scales of the locust having the appearance of armour. Hence it has been thought that the sacred writer here alludes to this horse-like appearance of the locust. It seems a little doubtful that this is the case, or that in this or any of the descriptions here there is any reference to the anatomical features of the locust. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-10.htm" title="And they had tails like to scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.">Revelation 9:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</span>--Here again there has been a desire to find some physical appearance in the locust to suggest the crown of gold: the antennae, the rugged elevation in the middle of the thorax, have been imagined to have some resemblance to a crown; and the face of the locust, it has actually been said, bears under ordinary circumstances a distant (the adjective is most needful) resemblance to the human countenance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the likenesses of the locusts</span>; that is to say, the general appearance. This similarity is brought out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2.htm">Joel 2</a>, and is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>. The parallel is worked out at some length in Tristram's 'Natural History of the Bible,' p. 314. In what way they appeared "prepared unto battle," is shown in ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">And on their heads were as it were crowns like gold;</span> <span class="accented">crowns like unto gold.</span> The language is carefully guarded so as to make it understood that this feature is altogether supernatural. The <span class="accented">crowns</span> of <span class="accented">gold</span> probably denote the conquering nature of the locusts, and thus they add to the power with which the locusts have already been invested. They may also signify the exalted temporal position of those symbolized by the locusts. Some writers believe the helmets of soldiers are typified, and others the turbans of the Mohammedans. <span class="cmt_word">And their faces were as the faces of men.</span> Notwithstanding the general resemblance of the locusts to horses, which resemblance is most clearly shadowed forth in the structure of the head, yet their faces gave the seer the idea of the human countenance. How this was brought about we are not told. Probably St. John himself in his vision received the impression without knowing by what means. The circumstance seems to point decidedly to the fact that human agents are denoted by the locusts.. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Upon sounding the fifth trumpet, a star fell from heaven to the earth. Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by this star becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers of hell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomless pit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs by blinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, and promoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm of locusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition, idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the true believers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But a secret poison and infection in the soul, should rob many others of purity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt those who had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace will keep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited to a short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithful share the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they might and would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were to try and prove the Christians, 1Co 11:19. And early writers plainly refer this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread the Christian church.</body></html>
