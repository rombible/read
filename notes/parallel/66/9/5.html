Their power is to inflict torment, and not death. The next verse tells us that men would consider death preferable to this torment; but the relief of the grave is denied them.<p><span class= "bld">And their torment </span>. . .--Literally, <span class= "ital">and the torture of them (i.e.,</span> the torture inflicted by them) <span class= "ital">is as the torture of a scorpion when it has stricken a man.</span> The wound of a scorpion occasions intense suffering: we have in it the symbol of the malicious cruelty of the merciless. The emblem is used in Ezekiel: the rebellious and malicious opponents of the prophet being compared to scorpions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 2:6</a>). We may compare the similar imagery of the bee for the Assyrian power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:18</a>), and the Psalmist's complaint that his enemies came about him like bees--a swarm, irritating him with wing and sting. The tenth verse tells us the way in which the injury was inflicted: there were stings in their tails.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months;</span> <span class="accented">and it was given them</span> [i.e. the locusts] <span class="accented">that they</span> [the locusts] <span class="accented">should not kill them</span> [the unsealed], <span class="accented">but that they</span> [the unsealed] <span class="accented">should be tormented five months.</span> The devil and his agents have not unlimited power committed to them; they are restrained within limits by the will of God. The evils which follow in the train of heresy and infidelity are not as yet permitted to kill (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>), for this judgment extends only to the natural life of man. God reserves the final killing to himself at the great judgment day. This is shown in the limitation, "five months." This apparently meaningless period becomes explicable, when we remember that the usual duration of a locust plague is <span class="accented">five months</span>, viz. from April to September. The visitation is for the natural period of such occurrences; the torment is to extend to the natural period of man's sojourn on the earth. It does not extend into the next life; other and special means are adopted for man's punishment then, as set forth under the seventh trumpet. Various other explanations have been given of the <span class="accented">five months.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Five years of Gothic rule (Vitringa). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Five months = 5 &times; 30 days; each day represents one year; therefore 150 years are signified, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> of the Saracens, A.D. 830 - A.D. 980 (Mede); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Mohammed's conquests, A.D. 612 - A.D. 762 (Elliott). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Hengstenberg believes 5 to signify a part of the complete number 10, and thus to symbolize an incomplete period, as compared with the period of the seventh trumpet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Bengel, following the principles assumed by him, makes the <span class="accented">five months</span> to equal 79 natural years, and assigns the period to A.D. - A.D. 589. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Others take the expression to mean "a short time" merely. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Wordsworth interprets it as meaning a limited time permitted by God, and thinks the Mohammedan period is signified, and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. "Their torment," that is, the torment of the unsealed, according to Alford; the torment of the locusts (viz. that which they inflict), according to others. In either ease the meaning is the same. The last clause, "when he striketh a man," is perhaps added in contradistinction to the injury naturally inflicted by locusts, whose efforts are directed against the vegetation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Upon sounding the fifth trumpet, a star fell from heaven to the earth. Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by this star becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers of hell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomless pit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs by blinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, and promoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm of locusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition, idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the true believers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But a secret poison and infection in the soul, should rob many others of purity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt those who had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace will keep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited to a short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithful share the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they might and would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were to try and prove the Christians, 1Co 11:19. And early writers plainly refer this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread the Christian church.</body></html>
