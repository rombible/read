After this fashion were they: the horses and horsemen were armed with breastplates of triple hue (corresponding to the three-fold destructive stream which goes forth from their mouth), the hues of flame, and dark purple (jacinth), and brimstone. The jacinth colour seems to be the dark purple or blue so often seen in smoke. The Poet Laureate uses the word "azure" to describe the colour of ascending columns of smoke ("azure pillars of the hearth arise to thee"): the colour here would be darker, the smoke not arising from peaceful dwellings, but generated among death-giving elements. The army is mainly of horsemen, and they are described as resolute and relentless: we are reminded of somewhat similar features in the Chaldean armies spoken of by Habakkuk, "I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation: they are terrible and dreadful: their horses also are swifter than leopards," &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/habakkuk/1-6.htm" title="For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs.">Habakkuk 1:6-10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them.</span> That is, according to the description following, not "thus, in such numbers as I have described." <span class="cmt_word">Having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "having," probably refers to both horses and riders, though it may refer to the riders only. The Revised Version renders <span class="accented">jacinth</span> more exactly as <span class="accented">hyacinth.</span> Alford translates, "breastplates, fiery red, fuliginous, and sulphureous." It seems to be rightly concluded that the <span class="accented">hyacinhine</span> hue answers to the "smoke" further on in the verse. "The expression, 'of jacinth,' applied to the breastplate, is descriptive simply of a <span class="accented">hyacinthine, i.e.</span> dark-purple colour" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible'). The description intensifies the terrible nature of the vision, and it is doubtful whether these details should be pressed to a particular interpretation. If they bear any meaning at all, they seem to point to the doom in wait for the wicked, whose portion is fire and brimstone (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone;</span> <span class="accented">proceedeth fire</span>, etc. (Revised Version). Here, as in the preceding clause, the intention is evidently to enhance the terrible appearance of the vision. The "smoke" corresponds to the <span class="accented">hyacinth</span> hue, mentioned in the previous part of the verse (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). The horses, in accordance with a well-known poetic figure, are said to breathe out "fire and smoke." Brimstone is mentioned in addition, in order to set forth plainly the fact that their acts are directed against the wicked (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-15.htm">Job 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-29.htm">Luke 17:29</a>). Lions' teeth are mentioned in the description of tire locusts, with the same purpose (ver. 9). It is difficult to see why Alford should imagine that the <span class="accented">fire, smoke</span>, and <span class="accented">brimstone</span> proceed separately from different divisions of the host: it was not so in the case of the breastplates. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-21 The sixth angel sounded, and here the power of the Turks seems the subject. Their time is limited. They not only slew in war, but brought a poisonous and ruinous religion. The antichristian generation repented not under these dreadful judgments. From this sixth trumpet learn that God can make one enemy of the church a scourge and a plague to another. The idolatry in the remains of the eastern church and elsewhere, and the sins of professed Christians, render this prophecy and its fulfilment more wonderful. And the attentive reader of Scripture and history, may find his faith and hope strengthened by events, which in other respects fill his heart with anguish and his eyes with tears, while he sees that men who escape these plagues, repent not of their evil works, but go on with idolatries, wickedness, and cruelty, till wrath comes upon them to the utmost.</body></html>
