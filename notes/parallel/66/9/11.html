Locusts have no sting; these have. Locusts have no king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-27.htm" title="The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;">Proverbs 30:27</a>); these have a king. The movements of the invading locusts are conducted with wonderful precision and order, yet no presiding monarch arranges their march; but here there is a directing and controlling head. The great movement is no mere undesigned or instinctive one, but the offspring of a hidden, spiritual force. The great battle is not on the surface only, the invasions, revolutions, tyrannies, which try and trouble mankind, involve spiritual principles, and are but tokens of the great conflict between the spirit of destruction and the spirit of salvation, between Christ and Belial, God and Mammon, the Prince of this world and the Prince of the kings of the earth. The king of these locust hordes is named in Hebrew Abaddon, or Perdition, a name sometimes given to the place or abode of destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm" title="Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.">Job 26:6</a>). "Destruction (Abaddon) hath no covering"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> before God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm" title="Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?">Proverbs 15:11</a>). In Greek his name is Apollyon, or Destroyer: The spirit of the destroyer is the spirit that inspires these hosts. It is a great movement, but its end is destruction, as its inspiring genius is from beneath, from an angel of the nether world. It is not necessary for us to seek some great historical personage for the fulfilment of this portion of the prophecy, any more than we ought to accept any great historical event as an exhaustive fulfilment of the vision. The picture is vivid and forcible, and its full and certain meaning will be plain hereafter; but it at least should draw our minds from the curiosity which seeks for historical or personal counterparts to the self-vigilance which fears lest our own spirit should be injured by the prevalence of any form of evil. It should teach us to remember always the vehement, earnest way in which the sacred writers describe the subtle, venomous power of all sin, and the merciless destructiveness of its work. It is not of any invading hosts, or signal and special forms of evil, but of the terrible and usual influence of all sin, that the Apostle St. Paul writes when he describes the world-wide devastations of sin in language partly borrowed from the Old Testament, but singularly reminding us of the vision before us. "There is none that doeth good; no, not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; the poison of asps is upon their lips; their feet are swift to shed blood; destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace have they not known; there is no fear of God before their eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-12.htm" title="They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.">Romans 3:12-18</a>). It is perhaps well to notice that at this fifth trumpet the unseen spiritual powers of darkness appear taking part in. the conflict. There is a time when the obstinate resistance of mankind (yes, and of individual men and women also) to better things becomes fortified by an evil spirit, and they are no longer passive resisters of good, but they become active antagonists of good, hating and obscuring the light of truth, and wounding the spirits and consciences of men. Alas! many walk of whom the Apostle could only say with tears, "they are the enemies of the cross of Christ" (the emblem of salvation), "and whose end is destruction" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:">Philippians 3:18-19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit;</span> <span class="accented">they have over them as king the angel of the abyss</span> (Revised Version). Most commentators contrast with the condition of the natural locusts, who have no king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7</a>). "The angel" evidently, points to the star of ver. l, who is Satan himself. Some think a particular angel, not Satan, is intended. Alford unnecessarily hesitates to decide that Satan is meant, owing to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3, 9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</span> <span class="accented">Abaddon</span> is the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, a noun representing the abstract idea "destruction" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-12.htm">Job 31:12</a>), but more frequently employed to designate the netherworld (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-22.htm">Job 28:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-12.htm">Psalm 88:12</a>). Apollyon (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, present participle) is the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (by which the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) personified. It is in conformity with St. John's usual practice to give the two forms of the name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-16.htm">John 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-13.htm">John 19:13, 17</a>). In the name we have summed up the character of him who bears it. He is the "destroyer," the one who causes "perdition" to mankind. Cf. the words of our Lord given by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), "He was a murderer from the beginning." Bengel and others contrast with "Jesus" the "Saviour." Perhaps the height of absurdity is reached by those writers (Bleek, Volkmar) who see in the name Apollyon a reference to (N)apoleon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Upon sounding the fifth trumpet, a star fell from heaven to the earth. Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by this star becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers of hell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomless pit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs by blinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, and promoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm of locusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition, idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the true believers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But a secret poison and infection in the soul, should rob many others of purity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt those who had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace will keep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited to a short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithful share the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they might and would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were to try and prove the Christians, 1Co 11:19. And early writers plainly refer this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread the Christian church.</body></html>
