We still have reference to the Egyptian plagues--this time to the locusts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/10-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.">Exodus 10:12-15</a>): "They covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened." Similarly, Joel describes the darkening of the land through the plague of locusts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joel/2-3.htm" title="A fire devours before them; and behind them a flame burns: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yes, and nothing shall escape them.">Joel 2:3-10</a>): "The sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining." But the locusts of our vision are armed with the power of scorpions, to sting and to torture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-5.htm" title="And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he strikes a man.">Revelation 9:5</a>): the scorpions are called scorpions of the earth. Some have thought that this expression is equivalent to land-scorpions, in contradistinction from so-called sea-scorpions. This hardly seems likely or necessary. Their power to torment men is the prominent idea. The locusts are not literal locusts: this scorpion- like power given to them is enough to convince us of this, even it the next verse did not clearly show it. The scorpion-like power seems to depict a malicious energy, as the locusts depict a devastating multitude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth.</span> The <span class="accented">locust</span> is constantly referred to in the Bible, and various illustrations are drawn from their characteristic features. In the East they appear in great numbers and men are helpless against their devastating power. Sometimes an attempt is made to check their progress by lighting fires, and this practice may have suggested the above description of the locusts proceeding from the smoke. The irresistible destruction which they cause is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13</a>; their number in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-15.htm">Nahum 3:15</a>. The air is sometimes tainted with their dead bodies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>). The natural features of the locust are fully dwelt upon in vers. 7-10. As an illustration, we may quote Niebuhr, who gives an Arab's description of the locust: "In head like the horse, in breast like the lion, in feet like the camel, in body like the serpent, in tail like the scorpion, in antennae like a virgin's hair." Three out of these five points of resemblance are mentioned in vers. 7-10. The <span class="accented">locusts</span> here symbolize heretics and infidels. Some writers (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Wordsworth) apply the symbol to the Mohammedans (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, where the parallel is very fully worked out). But though this may be, and probably is, a fulfilment of the vision, it would be wrong to thus restrict our interpretation. Scarcely any one cause has contributed more to the trouble and destruction of men than the violence which is the result of religious hatred. Whether it be the heathen idolater, the warlike Mohammedan, or the Christian bigot, who is the agent, the effect is the same. It may be said, too, that if the minds of Christians also had not been darkened by the prejudicial influence of Satan, who is the cause of their unhappy divisions, heresies, and apostasies, these troubles could scarcely have fallen upon mankind. The innumerable occasions of such violence may be well illustrated by the countless number of the locusts; and the effect lives after the death of the authors, tainting the moral atmosphere. It is true that the true Christian sometimes suffers also; but tidal is an aspect which is set forth in the visions of the seals. Here another view is set forth, namely, that the ungodly are themselves punished, and punished severely, by means of this evil influence of the devil. Many other interpretations have been suggested: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> evil spirits (Andrea,); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Roman wars in Judaea (Grotius); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the Gothic invasion (Vitringa); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> De Wette and Alford believe that the interpretation is unknown. <span class="cmt_word">And unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</span> That is to say, just as the natural scorpions of the earth have power to cause suffering, so these allegorical locusts of the vision appeared to possess the means wherewith to plague mankind. <span class="accented">The scorpion</span> is "generally found in dry and in dark places, under stones and in ruins, chiefly in warm climates.... The sting, which is situated at the extremity of the tail, has at its base a gland that secretes a poisonous fluid, which is discharged into the wound .... In hot climates the sting often occasions much suffering and sometimes alarming symptoms" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible '). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Upon sounding the fifth trumpet, a star fell from heaven to the earth. Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by this star becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers of hell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomless pit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs by blinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, and promoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm of locusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition, idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the true believers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But a secret poison and infection in the soul, should rob many others of purity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt those who had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace will keep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited to a short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithful share the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they might and would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were to try and prove the Christians, 1Co 11:19. And early writers plainly refer this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread the Christian church.</body></html>
