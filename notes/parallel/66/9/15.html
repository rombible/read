From aner and ops; man-faced, i.e. A human being.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And the four angels . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And there were loosed the four angels who had been made ready unto</span> (or <span class= "ital">for, i.e.,</span> ready for) <span class= "ital">the</span> (not "an hour," but <span class= "ital">the) hour, and day, and month, and year, that they should slay the third part of mankind.</span> The English version reads as though the hour, day, month and year were to be understood as the length of time over which this plague of war should last. This idea has been adopted by many of the historical school of interpreters, and great ingenuity has been exercised to find some period which exactly corresponds with this, and during which disastrous wars prevailed. But the expression ("made ready unto the hour," &c.) is not to be taken to imply that such was the duration of the plague; it implies that the loosing of the angels would take place at a definite period, the year, month, day and hour of which were known; the expression corresponds somewhat with our Lord's words, "Of that day and hour knoweth no man." It reminds us that there is a period--an unknown period, but nevertheless a certain period--at which the latent powers of retribution wake and begin to avenge themselves, at which the restraints which have withheld the long-deserved scourges are removed. Men and nations little think of this. Peace they cry, where there is no peace, for they have been by their sins mining the ground under their feet, or dwelling in that abode of false security which Bunyan might have called the city of Meanwell, and that abode is built on the sands; and when the angels of judgment are loosed, and the restraining influences of public opinion broken, the tempest is abroad, the frail house of formal religion falls, and the time of testing leaves its inmates unsheltered. Happy only are they who are ready for the hour of the Lord's return. The angels are made ready that they should kill the third part of mankind. The way in which this slaughter is to take place is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/9-17.htm" title="And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.">Revelation 9:17-18</a> : it is a wide and devastating slaughter carrying away a large portion of the human race.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. The alterations in the Revised Version make the meaning much plainer: <span class="accented">which had been prepared for the bout, and day, and month, and year, that they should kill</span>, etc. That is to say those "which had" in God's foreknowledge "been prepared" in order to operate at the exact period required - the exact <span class="accented">year, month, day</span>, and even <span class="accented">hour.</span> Each knew his appointed time. <span class="accented">Four</span> is the number used to denote universality in things of this world (see on Revelation 4:6). The number, therefore, seems to imply that the power of the angels is of universal extent. The <span class="accented">third part</span> are destroyed; that is, a great part, though not the larger (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-21 The sixth angel sounded, and here the power of the Turks seems the subject. Their time is limited. They not only slew in war, but brought a poisonous and ruinous religion. The antichristian generation repented not under these dreadful judgments. From this sixth trumpet learn that God can make one enemy of the church a scourge and a plague to another. The idolatry in the remains of the eastern church and elsewhere, and the sins of professed Christians, render this prophecy and its fulfilment more wonderful. And the attentive reader of Scripture and history, may find his faith and hope strengthened by events, which in other respects fill his heart with anguish and his eyes with tears, while he sees that men who escape these plagues, repent not of their evil works, but go on with idolatries, wickedness, and cruelty, till wrath comes upon them to the utmost.</body></html>
