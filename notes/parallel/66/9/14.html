Here the angel is represented as directly causing the incidents which follow; in the other cases, we are only told that each angel "sounded." <span class="cmt_word">Loose the four angels which are hound in the great river Euphrates.</span> This vision has led to a great variety of interpretations. Some are obviously absurd; in all these is considerable doubt and difficulty. The following is offered as a possible solution to some extent, though it is not pretended that every difficulty is satisfactorily disposed cf. In making this suggestion, the following circumstances have been borne in mind: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The trumpet visions seem constructed upon a systematic plan, and therefore it seems likely that this judgment, like the fifth and the seventh, is a spiritual one (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The objects of this punishment are those who commit the sins described in vers. 20, 21. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The vision must have borne some meaning for these to whom it was first delivered. It seems unlikely, therefore, that events are here portrayed which could not possibly have been foreseen and understood by the early Christians. This seems to exclude (except possibly in a secondary sense) all reference to the papacy, etc. (as Wordsworth). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Whether the angels here described are good angels or bad angels makes no material difference to the main part of the vision, which is to set forth punishment for the ungodly, sanctioned or originated by God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The object of the punishment is to bring men to repentance, but it largely fails to do so (ver. 21). We therefore conclude that the whole judgment portrays the spiritual evils which afflict the ungodly in this life, and which give them, as it were, a foretaste of their doom in the life to come. Sin frequently brings unrest and trouble immediately in its train; seldom, if ever, peace and satisfaction. The stings of sin are, perhaps, none the less potent because their effect is frequently unseen by the general public. The terror of the murderer, the shame of the thief, the abasement and physical suffering of the impure, the <span class="accented">delirium tremens</span> of the drunkard, are very real torments. The number of such inflictions is, indeed, great enough to be described as "two myriads of myriads" (ver. 16): they destroy a part, but not the greater part (ver. 15, "the third part") of men; and yet how largely they fail to bring men to repentance! Such punishment is a foretaste of hell, as seems to be foreshadowed in the "fire and smoke and brimstone" of vers. 17, 18. Wordsworth and others contend that the "four angels" are good angels, who have been hitherto restrained. As remarked above, the point is not a material one, but it seems more probable that evil angels are intended. Their loosing does not necessarily mean that they are loosed at a time subsequent to this vision, but only that they are under the control of God, Who allows them freedom to carry out this mission. Thus also, in the case of the other judgments, it has been pointed out that the period of their operation may extend throughout all ages, from the beginning to the end of the world. They arise from the <span class="accented">Euphrates.</span> Many writers point out that this river was looked upon by the Israelites as the natural source from which sprang their enemies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>). Indeed, the Euphrates was looked upon as the boundary of the Jewish kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-9.htm">1 Chronicles 5:9</a>); hence those coming from out of the Euphrates were frequently enemies. The expression may be merely accessory to the general filling up of the picture, or it may teach us that the punishments which follow flow from their natural source, viz. men's sins (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>, where the Euphrates is certainly alluded to as the source from whence arise hostile hosts). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:13-21 The sixth angel sounded, and here the power of the Turks seems the subject. Their time is limited. They not only slew in war, but brought a poisonous and ruinous religion. The antichristian generation repented not under these dreadful judgments. From this sixth trumpet learn that God can make one enemy of the church a scourge and a plague to another. The idolatry in the remains of the eastern church and elsewhere, and the sins of professed Christians, render this prophecy and its fulfilment more wonderful. And the attentive reader of Scripture and history, may find his faith and hope strengthened by events, which in other respects fill his heart with anguish and his eyes with tears, while he sees that men who escape these plagues, repent not of their evil works, but go on with idolatries, wickedness, and cruelty, till wrath comes upon them to the utmost.</body></html>
