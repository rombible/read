Whatever the plague be, it is one which cannot injure God's children. "Nothing," Christ has said, "shall by any means hurt you. I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-19.htm" title="Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.">Luke 10:19</a>). It is interesting and suggestive to notice that this promise of our Lord was given immediately after the saying, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven," as the safety of the sealed ones is mentioned here after the vision of the star fallen from heaven. The coincidence is hardly undesigned; at least, the sense in which we understand the danger from which Christ promised His disciples protection may afford us a guiding meaning here. Now, none have maintained that Christ promised His disciples entire freedom from danger, pain, and death. He said, "They shall persecute you and kill you; ye shall be hated of all men for My name's sake, but he that endureth to the end shall be saved." No real injury can happen to them; pain and death might be encountered, but all things work together for their higher good. They have a joy which no pain or peril can take away; they have a joy in this (it is the same chapter as above--Luke 10), that their "names are written in heaven." For such, death has no sting, the grave no victory. They meet famine and nakedness, and peril and sword; but in these they are more than conquerors. No plague can hurt those who have the seal of God in their foreheads. A plague from which those whose way is through tribulation are exempt can hardly be a physical one.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree.</span> The force of this plague is to fall directly upon mankind, not, as in the former judgments, upon the earth, and then indirectly upon men. This appears to be stated with the greater plainness, because it might readily be inferred, from the nature of locusts, that the immediate object of their destructiveness would be the vegetation of the world. <span class="cmt_word">But only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads;</span> <span class="accented">but only such men as have not</span>, etc. (Revised Version; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>, to which this is an allusion). Here, by proleipsis, the servants of God are described as "those that have the seal of God in their foreheads." It is not stated, nor is it necessarily implied, that the seal is visible to man at the time of the infliction of this judgment upon the ungodly. In a similar way our Lord speaks of the elect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>), not thereby implying that there is any visible manifestation by which the elect may be known to men, though known to God (so also <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>, etc.). Thus also it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>, "The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his." The frequent use of the term to denote those who were sealed by baptism may have led to the employment of the expression in this place, as being equivalent to "the servants of God" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>). The locusts may not hurt God's servants (see on ver. 3). Thus we are taught that God in reality preserves his own, though it may sometimes appear to man as though the innocent suffer with the guilty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Upon sounding the fifth trumpet, a star fell from heaven to the earth. Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by this star becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers of hell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomless pit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs by blinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, and promoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm of locusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition, idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the true believers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But a secret poison and infection in the soul, should rob many others of purity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt those who had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace will keep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited to a short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithful share the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they might and would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were to try and prove the Christians, 1Co 11:19. And early writers plainly refer this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread the Christian church.</body></html>
