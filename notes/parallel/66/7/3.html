The destruction prepared for the guilty world is not allowed to fall until God's elect have been gathered in, and preserved free from danger (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>, where immediately after the appearance of the Son of man, his elect are gathered from the four winds). (For the signification of the <span class="accented">earth</span>, the <span class="accented">sea</span>, and the <span class="accented">trees</span>, see on vers. 1 and 2.) <span class="cmt_word">Till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads</span>. The angel associates himself with the first four, as being on an equality with them in this work, although he alone is stated to possess the seal (ver. 2). Of the nature of the sealing nothing more is indicated. The <span class="accented">forehead</span> is naturally mentioned as being the most conspicuous part of man, as well as that which we are accustomed to regard as the noblest and most vital part. The idea may be compared with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4, 6</a>. It is remarkable, too, that the word in Ezekiel rendered "mark" is the name of the Hebrew letter <span class="accented">tau</span>, of which the ancient form was a cross (cf. the sign of the cross in baptism; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, "I will write upon him the Name of my God... and my new Name;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>, "Having his Father s Name written in their foreheads"). "The servants of our God," says Bengel, is a title which especially belongs to holy men in Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-17.htm">Genesis 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>). Those who hold the preterist view believe that the Christians who escaped the destruction of Jerusalem are indicated by this expression. The sealed are probably these referred to by our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22, 24, 31</a>, as "the elect." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-8 In the figurative language of Scripture, the blowing of the four winds together, means a dreadful and general destruction. But the destruction is delayed. Seals were used to mark for each person his own possessions. This mark is the witness of the Holy Ghost, printed in the hearts of believers. And the Lord would not suffer his people to be afflicted before they were marked, that they might be prepared against all conflicts. And, observe, of those who are thus sealed by the Spirit, the seal must be on the forehead, plainly to be seen alike by friends and foes, but not by the believer himself, except as he looks stedfastly in the glass of God's word. The number of those who were sealed, may be understood to stand for the remnant of people which God reserved. Though the church of God is but a little flock, in comparison with the wicked world, yet it is a society really large, and to be still more enlarged. Here the universal church is figured under the type of Israel.</body></html>
