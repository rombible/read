Better, And after this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding fast the four winds of the earth, that there might not blow a wind upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.</span> In the sixth seal the winds had blown, and had shaken violently the fig-tree, causing its untimely figs to drop off: the untimely or winter figs represented those whose religious life was unequal to the strain of trial, and who failed in the crisis to which they were exposed. But is all the fruit shaken off? No; Christ had said that "if a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch;" but that those who abode in Him, purged by their trials, would bring forth more fruit, and the fruit which these bore was not a fruit easily shaken off, but fruit that should remain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-6.htm" title="If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.">John 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm" title="I am the vine, you are the branches: He that stays in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.">John 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16</a>). They would not be as winter figs, easily torn from the boughs, for their strength was in God: before the stormy winds of manifold trials had blown they had been sealed with the seal of the living God. This is the scene which is brought before us in this chapter. In it the care of God, who restrains from violence the winds, that they should net shake too soon the immature fruit, the tokens by which the sealed are known and the meaning of their sealing are set forth. The chapter, in fact, answers the solemn question of the last chapter: "Who is able to stand?" The winds are clearly emblems of days of trouble or judgment; as the winds sweep away the chaff and clear the atmosphere, so do judgments try the ungodly, who are like the chaff which the wind driveth away: the storm of God's judgments shakes the mountains and the wilderness, and strips the oaks of the forest. (Comp. Psalms 29) These winds of judgment are ready to blow from all quarters (four corners of the earth), but they are restrained till the servants of God are sealed. For passages where winds are used as emblems of judgment, see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/49-36.htm" title="And on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.">Jeremiah 49:36-37</a>, "Upon Elam I will bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven. And I will bring evil upon them, even My fierce anger, saith the Lord." Comp, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm" title="Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove on the great sea.">Daniel 7:2</a>, "I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea." But those tempests would not arise or shake a single leaf till the securing of God's servants was accomplished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after these things.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, or, as some cursives read, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is generally regarded as denoting the close of the sixth seal and the commencement of a new subject, interjected by way of episode between the sixth and seventh seals. But, even if not looked upon as an integral part of the revelations made under the sixth seal, the connection is so close that the two must be regarded practically as one. The incidents of the seventh chapter are evidently the complement of those narrated in the closing verses of the sixth. They take up the question with which that chapter closes, "Who is able to stand?" and afford comfort and help to those suffering Christians who were so sorely in need of a renewed assurance of the certainty of their final reward. It seems better, therefore, on the whole, to consider the sixth seal to extend to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. Vitringa takes this view, which appears to be supported also by Wordsworth. Alford, while separating <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, as "two episodes," remarks, "The great day of the Lord's judgment is not described; it is all but brought before us under the sixth seal, and is actually going on in the first of these episodes." <span class="cmt_word">I saw four angels.</span> Of the nature of these angels we are told nothing. They are evidently ministers of God's will, and the mention of them following immediately upon the preceding description seems to connect the whole account more closely with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29, 30</a>, where the angels gather the elect from the four winds. It does not seem probable that "evil angels" are meant as understood by some writers, since what they do is apparently done at the command of God. <span class="cmt_word">Standing on the four corners of the earth</span>. That is, standing in the four opposite directions, and thus controlling all the earth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>). The number four is the symbol of universality and of creation (see on Revelation 5:9). <span class="cmt_word">Holding the four winds of the earth</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>). The angels may have been the "angels of the winds," just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a> an angel has power over fire, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a> we read of the "angel of the waters." The <span class="accented">winds</span> have been interpreted in two ways, neither of which seems strictly correct. The first is to give a literal meaning (as Dusterdieck) to the winds, and to understand literal windstorms as part of the judgment upon the earth. The second method interprets the winds as symbols of the judgments of the first six seals, which are held in suspension, while the elect are sealed. The truth probably is that the <span class="accented">winds</span>, like the <span class="accented">earthquake</span>, the rolling up of the heaven as a scroll, etc., are part of the figurative description of the destruction of the world at the judgment day; which destruction, like that of Sodom, is delayed for the preservation of God's elect. <span class="cmt_word">That the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "every tree," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, P, l, 36, Andreas, etc. The earth, the sea, the trees, are mentioned as things likely to be affected by the action of the winds; the two former, of course, embracing those things situated upon them, and the last being specially mentioned, perhaps, as a class of things which are peculiarly liable to destruction from wind. Wordsworth and others, interpreting symbolically, consider that the blasts of wind on the earth typify earthly powers, opposed to those of heaven, while the sea is emblematic of nations in a state of agitation against God, and the trees represent the great ones of this world. This interpretation, therefore, regards the objects mentioned as the enemies of God, which, by his command, are preserved from destruction and allowed to flourish in ease and apparent security, until the time of the sealing of God's servants has been accomplished. But it seems better to regard the winds as forming part of the general description by which God's judgment is foreshadowed. It is not unusual in the Bible for the wind to be mentioned in connection With destruction and judgment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-8 In the figurative language of Scripture, the blowing of the four winds together, means a dreadful and general destruction. But the destruction is delayed. Seals were used to mark for each person his own possessions. This mark is the witness of the Holy Ghost, printed in the hearts of believers. And the Lord would not suffer his people to be afflicted before they were marked, that they might be prepared against all conflicts. And, observe, of those who are thus sealed by the Spirit, the seal must be on the forehead, plainly to be seen alike by friends and foes, but not by the believer himself, except as he looks stedfastly in the glass of God's word. The number of those who were sealed, may be understood to stand for the remnant of people which God reserved. Though the church of God is but a little flock, in comparison with the wicked world, yet it is a society really large, and to be still more enlarged. Here the universal church is figured under the type of Israel.</body></html>
