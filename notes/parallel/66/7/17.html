The writer told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a> that he had seen a Lamb in the midst of the throne. When he looked towards the throne, he saw the Lamb as the central object immediately in front of it. He who would draw near to the throne must pass the Lamb. The position which the Lamb held was one of significance, and is therefore repeated here. The Lamb will tend His people as a <span class= "ital">shepherd</span> tends his flock (the word translated "feed" has this force), and will lead them to the springs of the water of life. The twenty-third Psalm rises at once to our minds. The Lord who was David's shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-2.htm" title="He makes me to lie down in green pastures: he leads me beside the still waters.">Psalm 23:2</a>), who was the Good Shepherd who sought and brought home the lost for whom He died (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm" title="What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?">Luke 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a>), does not forget the shepherd's work in heaven. He who made His people to drink of the brook in the way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-7.htm" title="He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.">Psalm 110:7</a>), who gave to those who came to Him the water which alone would quench their thirst (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-13.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:">John 4:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37-39</a>), leads them now to the springs of the living water, and makes them drink of the river of His pleasures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm" title="They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house; and you shall make them drink of the river of your pleasures.">Psalm 36:8</a>). Significantly enough the springs of this living water are in the throne itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1</a>). Ezekiel saw the stream issuing forth from the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goes to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan.">Ezekiel 48:1</a>), but in the city where there is no temple we are carried to the very throne of God, to find the well-spring of every gladness. In this emblem of the water we have another allusion to the Feast of Tabernacles. Among the ceremonies observed at the feast was that of the drawing water; the priest drew a vessel of water from the brook of Siloam, and poured it out in the temple-court by the altar of burnt offering, and the people sang the words, "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-3.htm" title="Therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of salvation.">Isaiah 12:3</a>). Here the Lamb, who is also the High Priest, leads His people to the springs of the water of life. Joy, too, is theirs; for God shall wipe away every tear from (or, <span class= "ital">out of)</span> their eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm" title="He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD has spoken it.">Isaiah 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm" title="And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.">Revelation 21:4</a>). In Isaiah it is said God shall wipe away tears from off all faces: here it is every tear. Thus shall all sorrow be removed from all: no tears shall gather in any eye, for the sources of sorrow will be cut off in the land where there is no more sin. None can weep again when it is God who wiped away their tears. Blessed are they that mourn, said Christ--blessed indeed in this, that God becomes their comforter. Only those who have wept can enjoy this consolation. Who would not shed life's tears to have God's hand to wipe them away!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lamb which is in the midst-of the throne shall feed them;</span> <span class="accented">shall be their Shepherd.</span> Compare the description of the position of the Lamb given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>. The position here indicated is the same as that there described. The Lamb is between the throne and those surrounding it, towards the middle of the throne. Christ is set forth in the character of Shepherd, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a> and John 21:16. <span class="cmt_word">And shall lead them unto living fountains of waters</span>; <span class="accented">and shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life</span> (Revised Version). "Of life" is an addition to the passage as found in Isaiah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>, where the expression is used of the Holy Spirit). <span class="cmt_word">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</span> A reference to the <span class="accented">tribulation</span> of ver. 14. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-17 Faithful Christians deserve our notice and respect; we should mark the upright. Those who would gain knowledge, must not be ashamed to seek instruction from any who can give it. The way to heaven is through many tribulations; but tribulation, how great soever, shall not separate us from the love of God. Tribulation makes heaven more welcome and more glorious. It is not the blood of the martyrs, but the blood of the Lamb, that can wash away sin, and make the soul pure and clean in the sight of God; other blood stains, this is the only blood that makes the robes of the saints white and clean. They are happy in their employment; heaven is a state of service, though not of suffering; it is a state of rest, but not of sloth; it isa praising, delightful rest. They have had sorrows, and shed many tears on account of sin and affliction; but God himself, with his own gracious hand, will wipe those tears away. He deals with them as a tender father. This should support the Christian under all his troubles. As all the redeemed owe their happiness wholly to sovereign mercy; so the work and worship of God their Saviour is their element; his presence and favour complete their happiness, nor can they conceive of any other joy. To Him may all his people come; from him they receive every needed grace; and to him let them offer all praise and glory.</body></html>
