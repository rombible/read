None of the privations which they have endured for Christ's sake shall trouble them; none of the dissatisfactions and weariness of life shall afflict them; for hunger, thirst, and fatigue will be no more, for the former things are passed away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.">Revelation 21:3-4</a>). And then, too, shall that blessed hunger and thirst --the hunger and thirst for righteousness--be appeased. Christ's benediction will then be realised in its fulness: Blessed are they who so hunger, for they shall be filled. And as they will receive inward strength and satisfaction, so also will they be kept from the outward trials which wear down the strength of the strongest. The sun shall not light on them: The Eastern sun, in its fierce and overpowering intensity, was a fit emblem of those trials which dry up the springs of strength. The sun, risen with a burning heat, devoured the beauty of the flower (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-11.htm" title="For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it wither the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.">James 1:11</a>); the rootless growth on the stony ground was scorched when the sun was up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-5.htm" title="Some fell on stony places, where they had not much earth: and immediately they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:">Matthew 13:5-6</a>). Man's beauty of wealth and talent, man's resolutions of better things, all fade away before the testing beams of this sun; but the time of trial is past, the pains and temptations of life are over, the sun in that land will not scorch, for there is no longer need of these burning beams; the city has no need of the sun, for the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm" title="And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.">Revelation 21:23</a>). No sun, and no heat, no burning hot wind like the sirocco, will spread withering influence there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat;</span> <span class="accented">shall the sun strike upon them</span> (Revised Version). The passage is evidently founded upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10</a> (cf. the punishment of the fourth vial, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-8.htm">Revelation 16:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-17 Faithful Christians deserve our notice and respect; we should mark the upright. Those who would gain knowledge, must not be ashamed to seek instruction from any who can give it. The way to heaven is through many tribulations; but tribulation, how great soever, shall not separate us from the love of God. Tribulation makes heaven more welcome and more glorious. It is not the blood of the martyrs, but the blood of the Lamb, that can wash away sin, and make the soul pure and clean in the sight of God; other blood stains, this is the only blood that makes the robes of the saints white and clean. They are happy in their employment; heaven is a state of service, though not of suffering; it is a state of rest, but not of sloth; it isa praising, delightful rest. They have had sorrows, and shed many tears on account of sin and affliction; but God himself, with his own gracious hand, will wipe those tears away. He deals with them as a tender father. This should support the Christian under all his troubles. As all the redeemed owe their happiness wholly to sovereign mercy; so the work and worship of God their Saviour is their element; his presence and favour complete their happiness, nor can they conceive of any other joy. To Him may all his people come; from him they receive every needed grace; and to him let them offer all praise and glory.</body></html>
