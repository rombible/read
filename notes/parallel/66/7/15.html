(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a>, where a well-supported reading is, "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life," &c.) They are before the throne: they are like Him, for they see Him as He is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1John 3:2</a>), and <span class= "ital">serve Him day and night in His temple, and He that sitteth upon the throne shall tabernacle over them.</span> The life is not simply one of joy or safety, it is one also of service. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3</a>.) Those who were made priests to God here carry on their service in His temple; yet it is to be remembered that this can only be figurative language, for in the heavenly city there is no temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm" title="And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.">Revelation 21:22</a>). It serves to teach us that the servant will find his fitting work of service there as well as here. <span class= "ital">He that sitteth upon the throne shall tabernacle over them.</span> It is worth noticing how persistently St. John keeps up the phrase, "He that sitteth upon the throne" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-2.htm" title="And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.">Revelation 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm" title="And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.">Revelation 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-7.htm" title="And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.">Revelation 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-13.htm" title="And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.">Revelation 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-10.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.">Revelation 7:10</a>). <span class= "ital">Tabernacle</span>, or dwell as in a tent: The rendering "shall dwell" among them does not do justice to this word, and at the same time obscures the allusion which the seer has in his mind. The allusion is to the Shechinah, the symbol of the Divine Presence, which rested over the mercy seat. "The idea that the Shechinah, the <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>; (<span class= "ital">skene</span>), the glory which betokened the Divine Presence in the Holy of Holies, and which was wanting to the sacred temple, would be restored once more in Messiah's days was a cherished hope of the Jewish doctors during and after the Apostolic ages." The expected and wished-for glory would be seen among God's saints. God's tabernacle shall be with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.">Revelation 21:3</a>), and with them so as to stretch over them: He will tabernacle over (or, <span class= "ital">upon)</span> them. With this we may compare St. Paul's expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.">2Corinthians 12:9</a> ("that the power of Christ may tabernacle" --"rest" in the English version--"upon me"), where Professor Lightfoot (whose words have just been quoted) thinks that there is a similar reference to the symbol of the Divine Presence in the Holy of Holies. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/4-5.htm" title="And the LORD will create on every dwelling place of mount Zion, and on her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for on all the glory shall be a defense.">Isaiah 4:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-27.htm" title="My tabernacle also shall be with them: yes, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Ezekiel 37:27</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>.) There seems also to be a carrying on of the imagery derived from the Feast of Tabernacles: as there were the palm branches of the harvest joy, so there will be the booth, or tabernacle, of God's presence among them. He shall be their pavilion, their shelter. "There shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore are they before the throne of God.</span> That is, because they have been washed, and have their robes made white, they are before the throne (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>, "Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it,... that he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle," etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And serve him day and night in his temple.</span> As described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, etc. <span class="accented">Temple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, the "dwelling place, the shrine, of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> heaven. Thus are the redeemed made "pillars" in his temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them;</span> <span class="accented">shall spread his tabernacle over them</span> (Revised Version). The same verb that occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-6.htm">Revelation 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>. The allusion (not an uncommon one with St. John) is to the Shechinah which overshadowed the mercy seat. God's presence among them, co-dwelling with them, is the happiness of his people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>, "Father, I will that they also be with me," etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>, "We shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is "). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-17 Faithful Christians deserve our notice and respect; we should mark the upright. Those who would gain knowledge, must not be ashamed to seek instruction from any who can give it. The way to heaven is through many tribulations; but tribulation, how great soever, shall not separate us from the love of God. Tribulation makes heaven more welcome and more glorious. It is not the blood of the martyrs, but the blood of the Lamb, that can wash away sin, and make the soul pure and clean in the sight of God; other blood stains, this is the only blood that makes the robes of the saints white and clean. They are happy in their employment; heaven is a state of service, though not of suffering; it is a state of rest, but not of sloth; it isa praising, delightful rest. They have had sorrows, and shed many tears on account of sin and affliction; but God himself, with his own gracious hand, will wipe those tears away. He deals with them as a tender father. This should support the Christian under all his troubles. As all the redeemed owe their happiness wholly to sovereign mercy; so the work and worship of God their Saviour is their element; his presence and favour complete their happiness, nor can they conceive of any other joy. To Him may all his people come; from him they receive every needed grace; and to him let them offer all praise and glory.</body></html>
