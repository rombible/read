It does not seem probable that any special design underlies the selection and arrangement here. First, with regard to the selection, we observe that Dan and Ephraim are omitted, the number being completed by inserting Levi, Joseph, and Manasseh. Although Ephraim and Manasseh are sometimes inserted instead of Joseph and Levi, and sometimes omitted, there seems only one example of a list in which any one of the others is omitted, viz. that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>, where no mention is made of Simeon. It has been thought that Simeon was purposely passed over by Moses on account of his ill conduct (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.) - conduct for which, unlike Levi, he afterwards made no sufficient atonement. This has led many commentators (Hengstenberg, Wordsworth, etc.) to conclude that Dan finds no place here because of the idolatrous worship of the tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>.). Many ancient writers (Bede, Andreas, etc.) account, somewhat similarly, for the omission by supposing that, in accordance with a very commonly received opinion, antichrist would arise from this tribe - an opinion probably originated by a comparison of the "serpent" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>. A third group, amongst whom are Ebrard, Dusterdieck, De Wette, Grotius, referring to an ancient Jewish tradition that the tribe of Dan had become extinct, and relying on the omission of this tribe in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4.htm">1 Chronicles 4-7</a>. - though Hushim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-12.htm">1 Chronicles 7:12</a>) may be the sons of Dan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-23.htm">Genesis 46:23</a>) - believe that the children of Dan no longer existed, and were therefore omitted. In the insertion of the name Manasseh (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Forgetting") Bengel sees an intended allusion to the omission of Dan, who is, he thinks, omitted for some mysterious reason. Ewald believes that St. John wrote <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x391;&#x39d;</span>, and that MAN., the abbreviated form of "Manasses," was substituted by error; and he appeals to manuscripts 9, 13, which, however, have "Dan" in place of "Gad." Moreover, Irenaeus, Origen, Arethas, have "Manasseh," and state plainly that Dan was omitted. It is certainly curious in connection with this conjecture that, if it were true, that is to say, if "Dan" should be read in place of "Manasseh," we should have a more intelligible order of arrangement. In that case, speaking generally, the elder sons would come first, the younger last; all the pairs of brothers are kept together (only that, in the case of the six brothers, there is a division into two lots); Judah naturally is placed first before Reuben, owing to the prominent place held by him in the Apocalypse in connection with our Lord. The order would then be - <span class="cmt_word">sons of Leah</span>.<br />Juda, Reuben Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zabulon <span class="cmt_word">sons of Zilpah</span>.<br />Gad, Aser <span class="cmt_word">sons of Bilhah</span>.<br />Nepthalim, [Dan,] <span class="cmt_word">sons of Rachel.</span><br />Joseph, Benjamin <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand</span>. As remarked above, Judah probably precedes Reuben from the greater importance he would possess in the mind of the writer of the Apocalypse, who continually exalts Christ, "the Lion of the tribe of Judah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Gad</span> were <span class="cmt_word">sealed twelve thousand.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-8 In the figurative language of Scripture, the blowing of the four winds together, means a dreadful and general destruction. But the destruction is delayed. Seals were used to mark for each person his own possessions. This mark is the witness of the Holy Ghost, printed in the hearts of believers. And the Lord would not suffer his people to be afflicted before they were marked, that they might be prepared against all conflicts. And, observe, of those who are thus sealed by the Spirit, the seal must be on the forehead, plainly to be seen alike by friends and foes, but not by the believer himself, except as he looks stedfastly in the glass of God's word. The number of those who were sealed, may be understood to stand for the remnant of people which God reserved. Though the church of God is but a little flock, in comparison with the wicked world, yet it is a society really large, and to be still more enlarged. Here the universal church is figured under the type of Israel.</body></html>
