Of the tribe of Joseph</span> were <span class="cmt_word">sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin</span> were <span class="cmt_word">sealed twelve thousand,</span> Ephraim is omitted, while Manasses is inserted. Wordsworth considers that this is on account of the rebellions character of the tribe of Ephraim (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5.htm">Hosea 5</a>, etc.). But Ephraim is sometimes identical with Joseph (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>), who here finds a place among the twelve. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-8 In the figurative language of Scripture, the blowing of the four winds together, means a dreadful and general destruction. But the destruction is delayed. Seals were used to mark for each person his own possessions. This mark is the witness of the Holy Ghost, printed in the hearts of believers. And the Lord would not suffer his people to be afflicted before they were marked, that they might be prepared against all conflicts. And, observe, of those who are thus sealed by the Spirit, the seal must be on the forehead, plainly to be seen alike by friends and foes, but not by the believer himself, except as he looks stedfastly in the glass of God's word. The number of those who were sealed, may be understood to stand for the remnant of people which God reserved. Though the church of God is but a little flock, in comparison with the wicked world, yet it is a society really large, and to be still more enlarged. Here the universal church is figured under the type of Israel.</body></html>
