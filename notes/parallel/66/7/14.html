The saints of God are continually passing into the unseen world, and taking their place among the spirits of just men made perfect. They come out of <span class= "ital">the</span> great tribulation. Are we to limit the expression to the special and peculiar afflictions of the last great trial? There is no doubt about the emphasis which the definite article (unfortunately, ignored in our English version) gives: it is <span class= "ital">the</span> great tribulation; but while there may yet be in store for the Church of Christ trials so great that they may be called, in comparison with those which went before, <span class= "ital">the</span> great tribulation, it yet seems out of harmony with the spirit of the Apocalypse and the complexion of this vision to limit the phrase to some special season of trial. Is not the great tribulation the tribulation which those must encounter who are on the side of Christ and righteousness, and refuse to receive the mark of worldliness and sin on their heart, conscience, and life? In all ages it is true that we must through much tribulation enter the Kingdom of God; and the vision here is surely not of those who will come safe out of some particular trials, but of the great multitude from every age and every race who waged war against sin, and who, in the midst of that protracted conflict, endured the great tribulation which is to continue until Christ's return. <span class= "ital">And they washed</span> (not "have washed," for the washing was done during their earthly life) <span class= "ital">their robes</span>, <span class= "ital">and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</span> The imagery is to be found in the Gospel and in the Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-8.htm" title="Peter said to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.">John 13:8-11</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1John 1:7</a>); its use here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,">Revelation 1:5</a> (if the reading <span class= "ital">washed</span> is to be preferred to <span class= "ital">loosed)</span> points to a common authorship: the emblem of the <span class= "ital">blood which washes white,</span> or cleanses, is not used with such distinctness elsewhere in the New Testament. It is, in St. John's lips, but a following out of the twice-repeated words which he quotes from John the Baptist at the opening of the Gospel, when he proclaimed Christ to be "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." In that Lamb of God those who came out of great tribulation found the forgiveness and the spiritual power which gave them confidence and hope in the midst of life's war and life's weariness; for the man who knows that he is forgiven and that he is being helped to holiness is the man who thinks no fiery trial strange, but rejoices in the knowledge that his salvation is of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest;</span> <span class="accented">and I say unto him, My lord</span> (Revised Version). The expression denotes the utmost respect and reverence, which afterwards induce the seer to worship the angel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8</a>). The structure of this part of the vision recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-3.htm">Ezekiel 37:3</a>, "And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2, 4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation;</span> <span class="accented">which come out of the great tribulation</span> (Revised Version). The repeated article is especially emphatic. The question arises What is "the great tribulation" referred to? Probably all the tribulation which has been passed through by the redeemed, all that which pertained to the life though which they have passed. This tribulation is now completed and past, and is therefore referred to as "the great tribulation." "These are they which have passed through the great tribulation of their life on earth." This is the view taken by Alford. Dusterdieck refers the expression to the last great trial of the saints before the coming of the Lord. Some point to particular persecutions as the reference intended, and others consider that "the last great trial to be expected under the seventh seal" is meant. <span class="cmt_word">And have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">and they washed</span>, etc. That is, during their past life, while they were experiencing the great tribulation, they washed their robes (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5</a>, where those who have "not defiled their garments" and those "that overcome" are to be clothed in white). Those that overcome and are undefiled, therefore, are those who have washed themselves in the blood of the Lamb, through which only their victory is possible or effective. Arethas, Bede, De Lyra, consider that the robes are washed of those who have endured martyrdom, and that they are washed in the blood of the Lamb, because it is the blood of his members. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:13-17 Faithful Christians deserve our notice and respect; we should mark the upright. Those who would gain knowledge, must not be ashamed to seek instruction from any who can give it. The way to heaven is through many tribulations; but tribulation, how great soever, shall not separate us from the love of God. Tribulation makes heaven more welcome and more glorious. It is not the blood of the martyrs, but the blood of the Lamb, that can wash away sin, and make the soul pure and clean in the sight of God; other blood stains, this is the only blood that makes the robes of the saints white and clean. They are happy in their employment; heaven is a state of service, though not of suffering; it is a state of rest, but not of sloth; it isa praising, delightful rest. They have had sorrows, and shed many tears on account of sin and affliction; but God himself, with his own gracious hand, will wipe those tears away. He deals with them as a tender father. This should support the Christian under all his troubles. As all the redeemed owe their happiness wholly to sovereign mercy; so the work and worship of God their Saviour is their element; his presence and favour complete their happiness, nor can they conceive of any other joy. To Him may all his people come; from him they receive every needed grace; and to him let them offer all praise and glory.</body></html>
