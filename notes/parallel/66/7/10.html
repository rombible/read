The salvation here must, I think, be taken in its most comprehensive sense, including every deliverance--from the curse of law, from the power of sin, and from the perils of life. The explanation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14</a> confirms this. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Philippians 3:9</a>.) This is "the voice of rejoicing and salvation which is in the tabernacles of the righteous," when the Lord, who is their strength and song, "has become their salvation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-14.htm" title="The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.">Psalm 118:14</a>). Note the recurrence of "the Lamb." They are before the throne and before the Lamb; their salvation is ascribed to God and to the Lamb.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And cried with a loud voice;</span> <span class="accented">and they cry</span>, etc. The present tense expresses the unceasing nature of their occupation (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Salvation to our God;</span> that is, "The praise and honour due for our salvation belongs to God, since he is the Cause of our salvation."

In acts of religious worship we come nigh to God, and must come by Christ; the throne of God could not be approached by sinners, were it not for a Mediator. They were clothed with the robes of justification, holiness, and victory; and they had palms in their hands, as conquerors used to appear in their triumphs. Such a glorious appearance will the faithful servants of God make at last, when they have fought the good fight of faith, and finished their course. With a loud voice they gave to God and the Lamb the praise of the great salvation. Those who enjoy eternal happiness must and will bless both the Father and the Son; they will do it publicly, and with fervour.
