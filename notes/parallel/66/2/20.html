From these words it has been thought that there was some personal influence at work for evil in Thyatira. Whether in the household of the "angel" or not is at least doubtful. The sin alleged against her is the same for which the Nicolaitanes are condemned--fornication, and the eating of things sacrificed to idols. If the above view be right, the leader of the exorcists is a woman--regarded by her followers as a prophetess, as one with a real message from God; but viewed by the Lord of the churches as a very Jezebel, teaching and seducing the servants of God. For letting her alone, for being timid, paying too much deference to her spiritual pretensions, for failing to see and to show that the so-called "deep things" of these teachers were depths of Satan, the chief minister is rebuked. A large number of respectable critics regard Jezebel as a name applied to a faction, not as belonging to an individual. It seems best to view the name as symbolical, always remembering that the Jezebel spirit of proud, self-constituted authority, vaunting claims of superior holiness, or higher knowledge, linked with a disregard of--and perhaps a proud contempt for--"legalism," and followed by open immorality, has again and again run riot in the churches of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I have against thee that thou sufferest</span>. This is certainly fight. "A few things" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) is an insertion in some inferior authorities. Others insert "many things" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>); the Sinaitic inserts "much" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;</span>); while the best authorities have nothing between <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>; and then <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> must be rendered "that" rather than "because." The construction is the same as in ver. 4. There is a right and a wrong suffering; and the Church in Thyatira exhibits both. The enduring of tribulation (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) is commended; the toleration of evil (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) is rebuked. It is not said that Jezebel receives sympathy or encouragement, but merely that she is let alone; her wickedness is left unchecked, and that is sinful. For this use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-7.htm">John 12:7</a>. It is difficult to decide between "the woman" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) and "thy wife" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), authorities being much divided; the balance seems in favour of the former. But even if "thy wife" be preferred, there is no need to understand Jezebel as indicating a distinct person. We are in the region of figures and metaphors. Perhaps all that is indicated is that the angel of the Church at Thyatira is suffering from the tolerated presence of a baneful influence, as did Ahab, "whom <span class="accented">Jezebel his wife</span> stirred up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>). And if it is not certain that any individual false prophetess is signified, it is scarcely worth while to speculate as to who this individual is. Jezebel may be a person, or she may be a form of false doctrine personified. If the former, Jezebel is doubtless not her real name, but a symbolical name of reproach, and what her name and status were we have no means of knowing. In any case the error represented by the name is closely akin to that of the Nicolaitans and to "the doctrine of Balaam." Whatever differences of detail there may have been, all three made Christian liberty a plea for an antichristian licence which claimed to be above the moral Law. And she teacheth and seduceth. This is an independent statement, and must not, as in the Authorized Version, be made to depend upon "thou sufferest." For the construction <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, compare <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). The word for "seduce," or "lead astray" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>), in the active is frequent in St. John, especially in Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a> 13:14; 19:20; 20:3, 8, 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). A comparison of these passages will lead to the conclusion that the word implies seduction into error of a very grave kind. It is not clear whether "fornication" is to be understood literally, or, as often in the Old Testament, in the spiritual sense of idolatry. The former seems more probable. "My servants" means all Christians, as is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a> and Revelation 22:3; it must not be limited to those in authority in the Church. (For "things sacrificed to idols," see notes on ver. 14.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-29 Even when the Lord knows the works of his people to be wrought in love, faith, zeal, and patience; yet if his eyes, which are as a flame of fire, observe them committing or allowing what is evil, he will rebuke, correct, or punish them. Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.</body></html>
