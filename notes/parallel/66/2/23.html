Those who have not merely been beguiled into sin by her, but are united to her in a permanent moral relationship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), shall perish in some signal manner by the visitation of God.

Moreover, the one seems to be final, the other remedial. <span class="cmt_word">And all the Churches shall know</span>; literally, <span class="accented">shall come to know, shall learn by experience.</span> This statement seems conclusive with regard to the purpose of these epistles. Although addressed to local Churches at a particular crisis, they are for the instruction of "all the Churches" throughout the world, and throughout all time. <span class="cmt_word">He which searcheth the reins and the heart</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>).

We need not attempt to make any sharp distinction between the <span class="accented">reins</span>, which were believed to be the seat of the desires, and the <span class="accented">heart</span>, which sometimes represents the affections and sometimes the conscience. Put together they are equivalent to "the devices and desires of our own hearts." <span class="cmt_word">And I will give to each of you</span>. From the angel of the Church the Lord turns abruptly to the individuals in the Church (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-29 Even when the Lord knows the works of his people to be wrought in love, faith, zeal, and patience; yet if his eyes, which are as a flame of fire, observe them committing or allowing what is evil, he will rebuke, correct, or punish them. Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.</body></html>
