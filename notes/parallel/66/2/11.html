It is said that Jews were familiar with it through its use in the Chaldee Paraphrase. It clearly points to a death which is other than that of the body; it stands in contrast with the crown of <span class= "ital">life.</span> The expressions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm" title="And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.">Revelation 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>, exclude the idea that a cessation of conscious existence is intended. The life of the spirit is the knowledge of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>); the death of the spirit, or the second death, is the decay or paralysis of the powers by which such a knowledge was possible, and the experience of the awfulness of a life which is "without God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath an ear</span> (see on ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">Shall not be hurt of the second death</span>; more literally, <span class="accented">shall in no wise be injured at the hands of the second death.</span> The negative is the strongest form; the injury seems to be of the nature of a wrong, and the second death is regarded as the source of the wrong (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a> "the second death" is almost personified, as here: "Over these the second death has no authority." The phrase is peculiar to this book (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a> and Revelation 21:8, where it is defined to be "the lake of fire"). The corresponding phrase, "the first death," does not occur. The one is the death of the body, to which the faithful Smyrnaeans must submit; the other is the death of the soul, from which the crown of life secures them: though they die, yet shall they live, and shall in no wise die, forever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). This second death, or death of the soul, is absolute exclusion from God, who is the Source of eternal life. The expression, "the second death," seems to be borrowed from Jewish theological phraseology. (On the repetition of the article, "the death, the second (death)," see note on ver. 13.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-11 Our Lord Jesus is the First, for by him were all things made; he was before all things, with God, and is God himself. He is the Last, for he will be the Judge of all. As this First and Last, who was dead and is alive, is the believer's Brother and Friend, he must be rich in the deepest poverty, honourable amidst the lowest abasement, and happy under the heaviest tribulation, like the church of Smyrna. Many who are rich as to this world, are poor as to the next; and some who are poor outwardly, are inwardly rich; rich in faith, in good works, rich in privileges, rich in gifts, rich in hope. Where there is spiritual plenty, outward poverty may be well borne; and when God's people are made poor as to this life, for the sake of Christ and a good conscience, he makes all up to them in spiritual riches. Christ arms against coming troubles. Fear none of these things; not only forbid slavish fear, but subdue it, furnishing the soul with strength and courage. It should be to try them, not to destroy them. Observe, the sureness of the reward; I will give thee: they shall have the reward from Christ's own hand. Also, how suitable it is; a crown of life: the life worn out in his service, or laid down in his cause, shall be rewarded with a much better life, which shall be eternal. The second death is unspeakably worse than the first death, both in the agonies of it, and as it is eternal death: it is indeed awful to die, and to be always dying. If a man is kept from the second death and wrath to come, he may patiently endure whatever he meets with in this world.</body></html>
