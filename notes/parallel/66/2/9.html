"We go from one hour to another, from one day and year to another, and what is once fairly past in our doing and omitting and suffering is scarcely regarded by us any more; it is like water that has flowed away. But into the omniscience of Christ all things are taken up" (Bengel).<p><span class= "bld">Tribulation.--</span>If persecution brought upon them poverty, it was the means also of unfolding to view their possession of the "true riches;" they were rich in honour, in that they were counted worthy to suffer; they would also grow rich in the graces which sufferings bring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-3.htm" title="And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;">Romans 5:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/1-2.htm" title="My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;">James 1:2-4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Blasphemy.</span>--They had to endure reviling as well as tribulation and poverty; and, harder still, to hear some who blasphemed that worthy name by which they were called.<p><span class= "bld">Jews.</span>--The Jews were foremost in this. "It was in the synagogue that they heard words which reproached them as Nazarenes, Galileans, Christians, Disciples of the Crucified" (Plumptre). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm" title="Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which you are called?">James 2:7</a>. It is interesting to notice that this characteristic hostility of the Jews was illustrated in the martyrdom of Polycarp. The Jews, "as was their wont," were foremost in bringing logs for the pile.<p><span class= "bld">Synagogue of</span> <span class= "bld">Satan.</span>--The word "synagogue" is only once used to describe the Christian assembly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-2.htm" title="For if there come to your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;">James 2:2</a>); and even there it is called "<span class= "ital">your</span> synagogue," not the "synagogue of God." In all other instances the "word is abandoned by the Jews." With the "synagogue of Satan" here, compare "the throne of Satan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>), "the depths of Satan" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-24.htm" title="But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put on you none other burden.">Revelation 2:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty</span>. "Thy works" has been inserted here and in ver. 13 in order to make the opening of all seven epistles alike. The uncials A, C, P, and the Vulgate, Coptic, and AEthiopic Versions omit the words in each place. The Sinaiticus inserts them here and omits them in ver. 13, where they are plainly awkward in construction. Like all wealthy cities, Smyrna showed the extremes of wealth and poverty side by side. It would be among the poor that Christians would in the first instance be found, and their Christianity would lead to their spoliation; in this much of their "tribulation" would consist. But thou art rich (compare the close parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the blasphemy from them which say they are Jews, and they are not.</span> We have here strong evidence of the early date of the Apocalypse. Throughout this book "Jew" is an honourable name for the worshippers of the Christ; "Gentiles," a name of reproach for those who oppose the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, etc.). These persecutors of the Church of Smyrna are Jews in name, but in reality are rather Gentiles - opponents, and not worshippers of the Messiah. The view taken in the Fourth Gospel is utterly different. There "the Jews" are almost invariably the opponents of Christ; the word occurs about seventy times, and nearly always with this shade of meaning. Assume that the Gospel was written a quarter of a century later than the Apocalypse, and there is nothing strange in this. Long experience of Jewish malignity in opposing the gospel has changed the apostle's views respecting his countrymen. He has become fully convinced of the inveterate and widespread character of the national apostasy. To him "the Jews" have become synonymous with the enemies of the cross of Christ. Assume that the Apocalypse was written about the same time as the Gospel, and how shall we account for this utter difference of view in the two books? Assume that the Gospel was written long before the Apocalypse, and how shall we explain the fact that experience of Jewish hostility has turned the apostle's abhorrence of "the Jews" into such admiration that to him a Jew has become synonymous with a believer in Jesus Christ? It is remarkable that, in the 'Martyrdom of St. Polycarp,' the Jews are said to have been present in great numbers, and to have been foremost (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) in collecting wood with which to burn him alive. <span class="cmt_word">A synagogue of Satan</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). This is in marked contrast to "the synagogue of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-4.htm">Numbers 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). With the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> is, in the New Testament, always used of Jewish assemblies, never of Christian. This usage soon became habitual in the Church (see Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' p. 4). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-11 Our Lord Jesus is the First, for by him were all things made; he was before all things, with God, and is God himself. He is the Last, for he will be the Judge of all. As this First and Last, who was dead and is alive, is the believer's Brother and Friend, he must be rich in the deepest poverty, honourable amidst the lowest abasement, and happy under the heaviest tribulation, like the church of Smyrna. Many who are rich as to this world, are poor as to the next; and some who are poor outwardly, are inwardly rich; rich in faith, in good works, rich in privileges, rich in gifts, rich in hope. Where there is spiritual plenty, outward poverty may be well borne; and when God's people are made poor as to this life, for the sake of Christ and a good conscience, he makes all up to them in spiritual riches. Christ arms against coming troubles. Fear none of these things; not only forbid slavish fear, but subdue it, furnishing the soul with strength and courage. It should be to try them, not to destroy them. Observe, the sureness of the reward; I will give thee: they shall have the reward from Christ's own hand. Also, how suitable it is; a crown of life: the life worn out in his service, or laid down in his cause, shall be rewarded with a much better life, which shall be eternal. The second death is unspeakably worse than the first death, both in the agonies of it, and as it is eternal death: it is indeed awful to die, and to be always dying. If a man is kept from the second death and wrath to come, he may patiently endure whatever he meets with in this world.</body></html>
