This glaring tautology is a mistranslation. The Revised Version is correct both in the order of the words and in the rendering. We have first the general statement, found in most of these epistles, asserting intimate personal knowledge: "I know thy works." Then we have, in two pairs, these works particularized, "thy love and faith," and "thy ministry and patience." Finally, we have the knowledge "that thy last works are more than the first." "Thy," in the central clause, belongs to all four substantives. Whatever may be thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span> in St. John's writings must certainly be translated" love," and not "charity." <span class="accented">Love and faith</span> produce as their natural fruit <span class="accented">ministry</span> to the sick and needy and <span class="accented">patience</span> in enduring tribulation. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, excepting here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>, occurs only in the writings of St. Luke and of St. Paul; it is specially frequent in the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm">Acts 1:17, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a>, etc.) and in 2 Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7, 8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>, etc.). That thy last works are more than the first. With the momentous change of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, this looks like a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm">2 Peter 2:20</a>). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> probably means more in value rather than more in number; compare <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-31.htm">John 7:31</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a>). But both excellence and number may be included. In any case, the Church at Thya-tira exhibits <span class="accented">growth</span> in good works, which is the surest sign of life. Like Ephesus, Thyatira is both praised and blamed; but whereas Ephesus has gone back (ver. 5), Thyatira is going forwards. The two Churches are in some respects the exact opposite one of the other. In Ephesus there is much zeal for orthodoxy, but little love; in Thyatira there is much love, but a carelessness about false doctrine. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-29 Even when the Lord knows the works of his people to be wrought in love, faith, zeal, and patience; yet if his eyes, which are as a flame of fire, observe them committing or allowing what is evil, he will rebuke, correct, or punish them. Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.</body></html>
