The word is translated elsewhere "throne," and should be here, "Where the throne of Satan is." But why should this pre-eminence in evil be assigned to Pergamos? The answer is difficult. Some leave it unsolved, saying that in the absence of any historical notice, it must remain one of the unsolved riddles of these epistles. Prof. Plumptre suggests that the general character of the city, its worship and customs, in addition to the persecutions which the Christians had encountered, may well account for the description. 'sculapius was worshipped as the "Preserver," or "Saviour." The symbol of the serpent must have been conspicuous among the objects of adoration in his temple. Curious arts were practised; lying wonders were claimed; persecution had extended to death. Such evil in such a city may have led to its being regarded as the very head-quarters of the enemy.<p><span class= "bld">Hast not denied.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Thou didst not deny My faith in the days in which Antipas My faithful witness, was slain, </span>&c.<p><span class= "bld">Antipas.</span>--Short for Antipater. (Comp. Lucas and Silas, short for Lucanus and Silvanus.) Nothing is known of Antipas. There are later traditions respecting him, but these are probably fancy-drawn.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know where thou dwellest</span>. The words, "thy works and," are certainly an insertion here - both external and internal evidence are against them. Even where Satan's throne is. We must translate <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> "throne" here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10</a>, etc. Throughout the Apocalypse heaven and hell are set over against one another; and as God has his throne, so also has Satan. The Authorized Version inconsistently alternates between "seat" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-16.htm">Revelation 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>) and "throne," even in the same verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>). "The throne of Satan" has perplexed commentators. It probably refers to the infamous idolatry practised at Pergamum, which had a cluster of temples to Zeus, Apollo, Athene, Dionysus, Aphrodite, and AEsculapius. These all lay together in a beautiful grove called the Nicephorium, the pride of Pergamum, as the temple of Artemis was the pride of Ephesus. Some have thought that the mention of Satan points to the serpent, which is so prominent in the cultus of Aesculapius. But the context leads us rather to understand the abominations connected with the worship of Dionysus and Aphrodite. Others, again, think that "the <span class="accented">throne</span> of Satan" indicates the persecuting judgments pronounced against Christians; for Pergamum was a great judicial centre. We must be content to leave the question open. <span class="cmt_word">Thou holdest fast my Name</span>. We have the same expression (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with the accusative) three times in this epistle and again in ver. 25 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>. Just as in the literal sense <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, with the accusative means "to seize" a man, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his whole person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-3.htm">Matthew 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-29.htm">Matthew 18:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>), as distinct from laying hold of a part (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-25.htm">Matthew 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>), so in the figurative sense <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with the accusative is "to hold fast" the whole of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3, 4, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>), as distinct from keeping a share in a possession common to many (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>). On the emphatic repetition obtained by denying the opposite, "holdest fast and didst not deny," see notes on Revelation 3:8. The Greek text in what follows is a good deal confused, and cannot be determined with certainty; but the general sense is clear. In any case, "my witness, my faithful one" (Revised Version), is more accurate than "my faithful martyr" (Authorized Version). The reduplication of the article is frequent in St. John's writings, but in some cases it produces clumsiness to reproduce it in English: <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> occurs here of Antipas, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a> of Christ; compare <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a>), <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>), <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>), with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38, 42, 44, 50, 51, 58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; 7:68; 8:16; 12:26; 14:15, 27; 15:9, 11; 17:13, 24; 18:36; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm">1 John 2:7</a> 2John 13.

The name is a shortened form of Antipater, as Nicomas of Nicomedes, Artemas of Artemidorus, Hermes of Hermodorus, Zenas of Zenodorus, Menas of Menodorus, Lucas of Lucanus, Domas of Demetrius; and therefore is not derived from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. Much mystical trifling has been expended over the name Antipas, which no doubt is the actual name of a once well-known sufferer for the truth. Probably of the Pergamene confessors, Antipas was the only one who was called upon to suffer death. The silence of Church history respecting a martyr thus honoured in Scripture is strange. Attalus, one of the chief martyrs of Lyons, was of Pergamum (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' V. 1:17; comp. IV. 15:48). The repetition of <span class="accented">"where</span> Satan dwelleth" emphasizes this point, like the repetition of <span class="accented">"repent"</span> in ver. 5. It rather confirms the view that by "Satan's throne" is meant the judgment throne where the martyrs were condemned. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 The word of God is a sword, able to slay both sin and sinners. It turns and cuts every way; but the believer need not fear this sword; yet this confidence cannot be supported without steady obedience. As our Lord notices all the advantages and opportunities we have for duty in the places where we dwell, so he notices our temptations and discouragements from the same causes. In a situation of trials, the church of Pergamos had not denied the faith, either by open apostacy, or by giving way so as to avoid the cross. Christ commends their stedfastness, but reproves their sinful failures. A wrong view of gospel doctrine and Christian liberty, was a root of bitterness from which evil practices grew. Repentance is the duty of churches and bodies of men, as well as of particular persons; those who sin together, should repent together. Here is the promise of favour to those that overcome. The influences and comforts of the Spirit of Christ, come down from heaven into the soul, for its support. This is hidden from the rest of the world. The new name is the name of adoption; when the Holy Spirit shows his own work in the believer's soul, this new name and its real import are understood by him.</body></html>
