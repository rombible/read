The little leaven might leaven the whole lump; and those who had been brave unto death in the days of persecution had been less temptation-proof against more seductive influences. The church tolerated without remonstrance men holding [the word is the same as that used in commendation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>), "Thou holdest (fast) My name"] "the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel; (namely) to eat things sacrified to idols, and to commit fornication." Israel could not be cursed, but they might be made to bring a curse upon themselves by yielding to sin; so the counsel of Balaam was to tempt them through the women of Midian, and "Behold, these caused the children of Israel to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm" title="Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.">Numbers 31:16</a>). A similar temptation was endangering the Pergamene Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I have a few things against thee</span>. They are few in comparison with the things commended; but they are very serious; and there must be a sad want of care in the Church at Pergamum to allow such things. These corrupt teachers are alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-11.htm">Jude 1:11</a>. Like Balaam, they debased spiritual gifts to the vilest purposes, and thus became a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a snare or stumbling block, to ethers. Like the Nicolaitans, they held that the freedom of the gospel placed them above the moral Law, and conferred licence to commit the foulest sins. The liberty to eat meats which might have been offered to idols was made a plea for liberty to take part in idolatrous rites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>; Justin Martyr, 'Trypho,' 35; Irenaeus, I. 6:3), and for introducing heathen orgies into Christian ceremonies. The doctrine of these antinomian teachers was "the doctrine of Balaam," because, like him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 4:06. 6; Philo, 'Vita Mosis,' 1. p. 647), they prostituted their influence to the seducing of God's people into idolatry and impurity. The similarity of this doctrine with that of the Nicolaitans is obvious; but that Nicolaus (which is equivalent to "conquering the people") is intended as a translation of Balaam (which is <span class="accented">possibly</span> equivalent to "lord of the people") is mere conjecture. That there were two sects side by side at Pergamum is the natural meaning of this passage; and though their doctrines were alike in being autinomian in principle and licentious in result, yet there is no need to identify them. Among countless small improvements made by the Revisers, note that the remarkable word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which in the Authorized Version is rendered in <span class="accented">six</span> different ways, is by them rendered consistently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-25.htm">Acts 21:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-19.htm">1 Corinthians 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14, 20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 The word of God is a sword, able to slay both sin and sinners. It turns and cuts every way; but the believer need not fear this sword; yet this confidence cannot be supported without steady obedience. As our Lord notices all the advantages and opportunities we have for duty in the places where we dwell, so he notices our temptations and discouragements from the same causes. In a situation of trials, the church of Pergamos had not denied the faith, either by open apostacy, or by giving way so as to avoid the cross. Christ commends their stedfastness, but reproves their sinful failures. A wrong view of gospel doctrine and Christian liberty, was a root of bitterness from which evil practices grew. Repentance is the duty of churches and bodies of men, as well as of particular persons; those who sin together, should repent together. Here is the promise of favour to those that overcome. The influences and comforts of the Spirit of Christ, come down from heaven into the soul, for its support. This is hidden from the rest of the world. The new name is the name of adoption; when the Holy Spirit shows his own work in the believer's soul, this new name and its real import are understood by him.</body></html>
