Its importance was due to other causes. A striking coneshaped hill rose from the plain which bordered the northern banks of the Caicus. The hill was considered sacred. Its value as a strong natural fortress was early recognised, and it was used as a keep and treasury where local chieftains deposited their wealth. Its greatness as a city dated from Eumenes II., who was given by the Romans a large surrounding territory, and who fixed Pergamos as his royal residence. Under his auspices a splendid city--rich in public buildings, temples, art galleries, and with a library which rivalled that of Alexandria--rose into being. It has been described as a city of temples, "a sort of union of a pagan cathedral city, an university town, and a royal residence." It retained its splendour even after it passed by bequest to the Roman Republic, and was declared by Pliny to be a city unrivalled in the province of Asia.<p><span class= "bld">Sharp sword with two edges.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>. The appropriateness of this language to the state of the church in Pergamos will best appear afterwards. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-15.htm" title="So have you also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.">Revelation 2:15-16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-17.</span> - The <span class="accented">epistle to the Church at Pergamum.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pergamum</span> is the usual form both in Greek and Latin writers; "Pergamus" is very rare. And if <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> were right here, why "Pergamos" any more than "Ephesos"? The city lies north of Smyrna, in Mysia Major, or the right bank of the Caicus. Pergamum is first mentioned by Xenophon, and becomes important and magnificent under Attalus, the friend of the Romans (B.C. 241-197), and his son Eumenes (B.C. 196-159). Its library was second only to that of Alexandria; but Mark Antony took it to Egypt and gave it to Cleopatra. Parchment gets its name from Pergamum, and Galen the physician was born there. Pliny writes of "longe clarissimum Asiae Pergamum" - a description which probably has reference to its buildings. It still exists under the slightly changed name of <span class="accented">Bergamah</span>, or <span class="accented">Bergma</span>; and its ruins still tell of the magnificent public edifices which have caused it to be described as a "city of temples," and again as "a sort of union of a pagan cathedral city, a university town, and a royal residence." Its idolatrous rites were frequent and various, and the contamination which they spread is manifest from this epistle. <span class="cmt_word">The sharp two-edged sword</span> (see notes on Revelation 1:16 and Revelation 2:13). How much this weapon is needed is shown by the evils protested against. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 The word of God is a sword, able to slay both sin and sinners. It turns and cuts every way; but the believer need not fear this sword; yet this confidence cannot be supported without steady obedience. As our Lord notices all the advantages and opportunities we have for duty in the places where we dwell, so he notices our temptations and discouragements from the same causes. In a situation of trials, the church of Pergamos had not denied the faith, either by open apostacy, or by giving way so as to avoid the cross. Christ commends their stedfastness, but reproves their sinful failures. A wrong view of gospel doctrine and Christian liberty, was a root of bitterness from which evil practices grew. Repentance is the duty of churches and bodies of men, as well as of particular persons; those who sin together, should repent together. Here is the promise of favour to those that overcome. The influences and comforts of the Spirit of Christ, come down from heaven into the soul, for its support. This is hidden from the rest of the world.
