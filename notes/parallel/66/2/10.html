In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.">John 16:33</a>). He never conceals the difficulties or dangers of His service. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-16.htm" title="For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.">Acts 9:16</a>.) So here He proclaims, "Behold, the devil shall cast some. . . ."<p><span class= "bld">The devil.</span>--The LXX. translation gives this name to Satan, regarding him as the "accuser." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm" title="And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.">Revelation 12:10</a>, where he is described as the "accuser of the brethren.")<p><span class= "bld">Tried.</span>--On the part of the adversary, the intention was that they might be <span class= "ital">tempted</span> from their allegiance to Christ. The real effect would be that they who endured would come forth tested and approved. The suffering would be for "ten days." This is variously explained. Some think it applies to the periods of persecution; others understand it to mean a long persecution of ten years; others take it literally; others again view it as expressing completeness: the test would be thorough. The exhortation, "Be thou faithful (even) unto death," seems to favour this last; while the mention of "ten days" was, perhaps, designed to remind them that the period of trial was limited by Him who knew what they could bear, and would be but a little while when compared with the life with which they would be crowned.<p><span class= "bld">A crown of life.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the crown of life.</span> A crown was given to the priest who presided at the Dionysian Mysteries, which were celebrated with great pomp at Smyrna. A crown was also given at the Olympian Games, which were held at Smyrna. If there is any allusion to either of these, the latter would be the most natural. Some hold, however, the crown--though the word is <span class= "ital">Stephanos, </span>not <span class= "ital">diadema</span>--is rather that of royalty than of victory. It is interesting to note that the narrative which tells of the death of Polycarp closes with words which it is difficult not to believe to be an allusion to this promise--"By his patience he overcame the unrighteous ruler, and received the crown of immortality" (<span class= "ital">Smyrn.

We must bring out the difference between "to be about to" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), in the first two clauses, and the simple future (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) in the third; compare "I will show him how many things he must suffer for my Name's sake" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>). The devil, who inspires the "synagogue of Satan," is to be allowed to afflict them, as he afflicted Job. (For "behold," see note on ver. 22.) The expression, "some of you" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), is an interesting link of style between this book and the Fourth Gospel and the Second Epistle; we have a similar construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-24.htm">John 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-17.htm">John 16:17</a> 2John 4.

It is unwise to make anything either mystical or rigidly literal out of the number ten, which here is probably a round number. The question is whether the round number denotes a small (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-19.htm">Numbers 11:19</a>) or a large number (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a>). The former seems probable. It is not impossible that some analogy between their case and that of the "four children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12, 15</a>) is suggested by the ten days' probation. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou faithful unto death</span>; literally, <span class="accented">become thou faithful</span>; show thyself to be such (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Note how completely the angel of the Church is identified with the Church. In this one verse we have complete mixture of the two modes of address: "<span class="accented">Thou</span> art about to suffer... some <span class="accented">of you</span>... <span class="accented">ye</span> shall have... I will give <span class="accented">thee."</span> "Unto death" does not merely mean "to thy life's end," but "even if fidelity involves death;" compare "becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The crown of life</span>. The Authorized Version, by ignoring the article ("a crown of life"), sadly detracts from the meaning. It is the well-known crown, the crown which is truly such, in contrast to earthly crowns, and perhaps with a special reference to the crowns given at Smyrna to the priests of Dionysus at the expiration of their year of office. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has been found in inscriptions at Smyrna in this connexion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, where the same phrase occurs; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>). Excepting <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> (where we have <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the regular word for "crown" in the New Testament. "Of life" is the genitive of apposition; the life is the crown, just as in "the Word of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>) the life is the Word. It is impossible to determine whether St. John has in his mind the crown of a king, of a victorious athlete, or of a triumphant warrior. The XII. Tables provided that he who had won a crown might have it placed on his head when his dead body was carried in the funeral procession. St. John, both at Rome and in the East, would have seen this ceremony, possibly in the case of a crowned priest at Smyrna. "The crown of life" would be the exact opposite of that. The narrative of the martyrdom of St. Polycarp draws to a close with these words: "Having by his <span class="accented">patience</span> vanquished the unjust ruler, and having thus received <span class="accented">the crown of immortality,"</span> etc. The writer seems to have had <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> in his mind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:8-11 Our Lord Jesus is the First, for by him were all things made; he was before all things, with God, and is God himself. He is the Last, for he will be the Judge of all. As this First and Last, who was dead and is alive, is the believer's Brother and Friend, he must be rich in the deepest poverty, honourable amidst the lowest abasement, and happy under the heaviest tribulation, like the church of Smyrna. Many who are rich as to this world, are poor as to the next; and some who are poor outwardly, are inwardly rich; rich in faith, in good works, rich in privileges, rich in gifts, rich in hope. Where there is spiritual plenty, outward poverty may be well borne; and when God's people are made poor as to this life, for the sake of Christ and a good conscience, he makes all up to them in spiritual riches. Christ arms against coming troubles. Fear none of these things; not only forbid slavish fear, but subdue it, furnishing the soul with strength and courage. It should be to try them, not to destroy them. Observe, the sureness of the reward; I will give thee: they shall have the reward from Christ's own hand. Also, how suitable it is; a crown of life: the life worn out in his service, or laid down in his cause, shall be rewarded with a much better life, which shall be eternal. The second death is unspeakably worse than the first death, both in the agonies of it, and as it is eternal death: it is indeed awful to die, and to be always dying. If a man is kept from the second death and wrath to come, he may patiently endure whatever he meets with in this world.</body></html>
