And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.">1Kings 21:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold!</span> The exclamation "arrests attention, and prepares the way for something unexpected and terrible." It is one of the many differences between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse, that in the former <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> is the dominant form, while in the latter <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span> is the invariable form (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>:l, 5, 7 is a spurious addition); <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span> is very rare in the Gospel; <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> is found nowhere in the Apocalypse. In the Epistles neither form occurs. <span class="cmt_word">I do cast her into a bed</span>. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span>, is the true reading; the future has been substituted for the present to match the futures in ver. 23. Forbearance having failed, God tries severity; and, as so often in his dealings with man, the instrument of wrong doing is made the instrument of punishment. The bed of sin becomes a bed of suffering. Compare "In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine;" and "I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is one of many words which has become weakened in meaning in late Greek: it often means no more than "place" or "put" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-7.htm">John 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>). In the passive it is rather common of being <span class="accented">laid up</span> in sickness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-6.htm">Matthew 8:6, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-30.htm">Mark 7:30</a>). But perhaps we should rather compare such expressions as "cast into prison, into the sea, into the fire, into Gehenna" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-30.htm">Matthew 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8, 9</a>). It may be doubted whether there is any significance in the fact that her sin is spoken of as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 21), whereas those who sin with her are said <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Idolatry is spoken of both as whoredom and as adultery. In the one case it is a <span class="accented">contrast to</span> the marriage tie between God and his faithful worshippers; in the other it is a <span class="accented">violation</span> of it. Jezebel anticipates the harlot of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>, as Balaam anticipates the false prophet of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. The remarkable construction, "repent <span class="accented">out of"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>), is peculiar to this book (vers. 21, 22; 9:20, 21; 16:11; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-22.htm">Acts 8:22</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm">Hebrews 6:1</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> (compare the converse, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>). <span class="accented">"Her</span> works" is to be preferred to "their works." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> might easily be changed to <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, either accidentally, owing to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or deliberately, because it seems strange to talk of repenting from the works of another person. But the point is that those who have become partakers in her sins have abandoned their own works for hers; and it is therefore from her works that they are bidden to repent (compare "my works" in ver. 26). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:18-29 Even when the Lord knows the works of his people to be wrought in love, faith, zeal, and patience; yet if his eyes, which are as a flame of fire, observe them committing or allowing what is evil, he will rebuke, correct, or punish them. Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.</body></html>
