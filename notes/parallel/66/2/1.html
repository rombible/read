Accepting the earlier date--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the reign of Nero, or (with Gebhardt) of Galba--the angel is no other than Timothy. Some striking coincidences favour this view. Labour, work, endurance, are what St. Paul acknowledges in Timothy, and which he exhorts him to cultivate more and more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-6.htm" title="The farmer that labors must be first partaker of the fruits.">2Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2Timothy 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>). Again, against false teachers he warns him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-7.htm" title="Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.">1Timothy 1:7</a>). Further, there is "a latent tone of anxiety" in the Epistles to Timothy. The nature with which he had to do was emotional even to tears, ascetic, devout; but there was in it a tendency to lack of energy and sustained enthusiasm. "He urges him to stand up, to rekindle the grace of God, just as here there is a hint of a first love left." (See Prof. Plumptre, <span class= "ital">Ep. to Seven Churches.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Ephesus.</span>--The chief city of Ionia, and at this time the most important city in Asia. It possessed advantages commercial, geographical, and ecclesiastical, and, in addition, great Christian privileges. It was a wealthy focus for trade; it reached out one hand to the East, while with the other it grasped Greek culture. Its magnificent temple was one of the seven wonders of the world; the skill of Praxiteles had contributed to its beauty. The fragments of its richly-sculptured columns, now to be seen in the British Museum, will convey some idea of its gigantic proportions and splendid decorations. But the religious tone induced by its pagan worship was of the lowest order. Degrading superstitions were upheld by a mercenary priesthood; the commercial instinct and the fanatical spirit had joined hands in support of a soul-enslaving creed, and in defence of a sanctuary which none but those devoid of taste could contemplate without admiration. But its spiritual opportunities were proportioned to its needs. It had been the scene of three years' labour of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm" title="Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.">Acts 20:31</a>), of the captivating and convincing eloquence of Apollos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-24.htm" title="And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.">Acts 18:24</a>), of the persistent labours of Aquila and Priscilla (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>); Tychicus, the beloved and faithful, had been minister there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a>); Timothy was its chief pastor.<p><span class= "bld">These things saith he. . . .</span>--The titles by which Christ is described at the opening of the seven epistles are mainly drawn from Revelation 1. The vision is found to supply features appropriate to the needs of the several churches. The message comes in this epistle from One who "<span class= "ital">holdeth</span>" firmly in His grasp (a stronger word than "He that hath" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>), and walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. The Church at Ephesus needed to remember their Lord as such. The first love had gone out of their religion; there was a tendency to fall into a mechanical faith, strong against heresy, but tolerant of conventionalism. Their temptations did not arise from the prevalence of error, or the bitterness of persecution, but from a disposition to fall backward and again do the dead works of the past. There was not so much need to take heed unto their doctrine, but there was great need that they should take heed unto themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.">1Timothy 4:16</a>). But when there is danger because earnestness in the holy cause is dying out, and the very decorum of religion has become a snare, what more fitting than to be reminded of Him whose hand can strengthen and uphold them, and who walks among the candlesticks, to supply them with the oil of fresh love? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/4-2.htm" title="And said to me, What see you? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are on the top thereof:">Zechariah 4:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-3.htm" title="They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:">Matthew 25:3-4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-3:22.</span> - <span class="accented">The epistles to the seven Churches.</span> Once more we have to consider rival interpretations. Of these we may safely set aside all those which make the seven letters to be pictures of <span class="accented">successive periods</span> in the history of the Church. On the other hand, we may safely deny that the letters are <span class="accented">purely typical</span>, and relate to nothing definite in history. Rather they are <span class="accented">both historical and typical.</span> They refer primarily to the actual condition of the several Churches in St. John's own day, and then are intended for the instruction, encouragement, and warning of the Church and the Churches throughout all time. The Catholic Church, or any one of its branches, will at any period find itself reflected in one or other of the seven Churches. For two Churches, Smyrna and Philadelphia, there is nothing but praise; for two, Sardis and Laodicea, nothing but blame; for the majority, and among them the chief Church of all, Ephesus, with Pergamum and Thyatira, praise and blame in different degrees intermingled. The student will find it instructive to place the epistles side by side in seven parallel columns, and note the elements common to each and the order in which these elements appear. These common elements are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Christ's command</span> to the seer to write; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">his title</span>, which in most cases is taken from the descriptions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the <span class="accented">praise</span>, or <span class="accented">blame</span>, or both, addressed to the angel, based in all cases on intimate personal knowledge - "I know thy works;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the <span class="accented">charge</span> or warning, generally in connexion with Christ's coming; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the <span class="accented">promise to the victor</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the <span class="accented">call to each individual</span> to give ear. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - <span class="accented">The epistle to the Church at Ephesus.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the angel</span> (see on Revelation 1:20). "The angel" seems to be the spirit of the Church personified as its responsible guardian. <span class="cmt_word">The Church of Ephesus</span>. "<span class="accented">In</span> Ephesus" is certainly the right reading; in all seven cases it is the angel of the Church <span class="accented">in</span> the place that is addressed. In St. Paul's:Epistles we have "<span class="accented">in</span> Rome," "<span class="accented">in</span> Corinth," "<span class="accented">in</span> Colossae," "<span class="accented">in</span> Ephesus," "<span class="accented">of</span> Galatia," "<span class="accented">of</span> the Thessalonians." Among all the cities of the Roman province of Asia, Ephesus ranked as "first of all and greatest." It was called "the metropolis of Asia." Romans visiting Asia commonly landed first at Ephesus. Its position as a centre of commerce was magnificent. Three rivers, the Maeander, the Cayster, and the Hermes, drain Western Asia Minor, and Ephesus stood on high ground near the mouth of the central river, the Cayster, which is connected by passes with the valleys of the other two. Strabo, writing of Ephesus about the time when St. John was born, says, "Owing to its favourable situation, the city is in all other respects increasing daily, for it is the greatest place of trade of all the cities of Asia west of the Taurus." Patmos was only a day's sail from Ephesus; and it is by no means improbable that the gorgeous description of the merchandise of "Babylon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12, 13</a>) is derived from St. John's own recollections of Ephesus. The Church of Ephesus was founded by St. Paul, about A.D. , and his Epistle to that and other Churches, now called simply "to the Ephesians," was written about A.D. . When St. Paul went to Macedonia, Timothy was left at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>) to check the wild speculations in which some Ephesian Christians had begun to indulge. Timothy probably followed St. Paul to Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-9.htm">2 Timothy 4:9, 21</a>), and, after his master's death, returned to Ephesus, where he is said to have suffered martyrdom at a festival in honour of the great goddess Artemis." He may have been still at Ephesus at the time when this epistle was written; and Plumptre has traced coincidences between this epistle and those of St. Paul to Timothy. According to Dorotheus of Tyro (circ. A.D. 300), he was succeeded by Gaius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>). In the Ignatian epistles we have Onesimus (probably not the servant of Philemon), Bishop of Ephesus. Ignatius speaks of the Ephesian Church in terms of high praise, showing that it had profited by the exhortations in this epistle. It was free from heresy, though heresy hovered around it. It was spiritually minded, and took God as its rule of life (Ignatius, 'Ephes.,' 6-8.). <span class="cmt_word">Write</span> (see on Revelation 1:11; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>). Holdeth (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). Stronger than "had" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>. This word implies holding fast and having full control over. In ver. 25 we have both verbs, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>. A Church that had fallen from its first love (vers. 4, 5) had need to be reminded of him who "holds fast" his own; and one whose candlestick was in danger of removal had need to turn to him who is ever active (not merely is, but "walketh") "in the midst of the candlesticks," to supply them with oil when they flicker, and rekindle them when they go out. It is he, and not the apostle, who addresses them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 These churches were in such different states as to purity of doctrine and the power of godliness, that the words of Christ to them will always suit the cases of other churches, and professors. Christ knows and observes their state; though in heaven, yet he walks in the midst of his churches on earth, observing what is wrong in them, and what they want. The church of Ephesus is commended for diligence in duty. Christ keeps an account of every hour's work his servants do for him, and their labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. But it is not enough that we are diligent; there must be bearing patience, and there must be waiting patience. And though we must show all meekness to all men, yet we must show just zeal against their sins. The sin Christ charged this church with, is, not the having left and forsaken the object of love, but having lost the fervent degree of it that at first appeared. Christ is displeased with his people, when he sees them grow remiss and cold toward him. Surely this mention in Scripture, of Christians forsaking their first love, reproves those who speak of it with carelessness, and thus try to excuse indifference and sloth in themselves and others; our Saviour considers this indifference as sinful. They must repent: they must be grieved and ashamed for their sinful declining, and humbly confess it in the sight of God. They must endeavour to recover their first zeal, tenderness, and seriousness, and must pray as earnestly, and watch as diligently, as when they first set out in the ways of God. If the presence of Christ's grace and Spirit is slighted, we may expect the presence of his displeasure. Encouraging mention is made of what was good among them. Indifference as to truth and error, good and evil, may be called charity and meekness, but it is not so; and it is displeasing to Christ. The Christian life is a warfare against sin, Satan, the world, and the flesh. We must never yield to our spiritual enemies, and then we shall have a glorious triumph and reward. All who persevere, shall derive from Christ, as the Tree of life, perfection and confirmation in holiness and happiness, not in the earthly paradise, but in the heavenly. This is a figurative expression, taken from the account of the garden of Eden, denoting the pure, satisfactory, and eternal joys of heaven; and the looking forward to them in this world, by faith, communion with Christ, and the consolations of the Holy Spirit. Believers, take your wrestling life here, and expect and look for a quiet life hereafter; but not till then: the word of God never promises quietness and complete freedom from conflict here.</body></html>
