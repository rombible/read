Here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>; and in Revelation 19:15, the LXX. rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a> is adopted; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "Thou shalt <span class="accented">rule</span> them," or more literally, "shalt <span class="accented">shepherd</span> them," instead of "shalt <span class="accented">break</span> them," which almost certainly is the meaning of the Hebrew. The Hebrew original, <span class="accented">trhm</span> without vowel points, may represent either <span class="accented">tirhem</span> or <span class="accented">terohem</span>; but the latter is required by what follows; "shalt dash them in pieces." Nevertheless, the gentler rendering better suits the requirements of these passages in the Apocalypse. The rule over the nations is to be strong, but it is to be loving also. To those who obey it, it will be a shepherding; only those who resist it will be dashed in pieces. Precisely the same expression is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> of the Lamb shepherding his saints, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm">John 21:16</a> in the charge to St. Peter to shepherd Christ's sheep. It is not easy to determine whether the "rod" (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f00;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;</span>) is a king's sceptre, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>, or a shepherd's staff, as m <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-7.htm">Zechariah 11:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">As the vessels of pottery are broken to shivers</span>.

Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.</body></html>
