The veneer of a formal faith might impose on the world, but it would not escape His scrutiny (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm" title="And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,">Acts 1:24</a>). He knows, too, and lovingly accepts, the unmarked and unrequited acts of true love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-42.htm" title="And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.">Matthew 10:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-13.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman has done, be told for a memorial of her.">Matthew 26:13</a>), and appreciates, amid all its failures, genuine loyalty to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-17.htm" title="He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Love you me? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.

The first word signifies labour carried on unto weariness. The "patience" is more than passive endurance; it is, as Archbishop Trench says, a beautiful word, expressing the brave and persistent endurance of the Christian. But though thus possessed of endurance, He commends them that they could not endure evil men. In one sense, the lingering of this grace among them is the green leaf betokening better things; they have not lost the power of hating evil. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-9.htm" title="Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; hold to that which is good.">Romans 12:9</a>.) No man loves God truly who cannot hate evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-3.htm" title="I will set no wicked thing before my eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not stick to me.">Psalm 101:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And thou hast tried</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">didst try</span>) <span class= "bld">them . . . and hast found them liars.</span>--St. Paul had warned the Ephesian elders of the appearance of false teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28-31</a>). Zeal for pure doctrine characterised the Ephesian Church. It is commended by Ignatius in his epistle (<span class= "ital">ad Ep. 6</span>). The false apostles here spoken of are not, I think, to be identified with the Nicolaitanes of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-6.htm" title="But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.">Revelation 2:6</a>; that verse is introduced as a further ground of commendation, mitigating the censure of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-4.htm" title="Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love.">Revelation 2:4-5</a>. The claims to be considered apostles, which the Ephesian Church had disposed of, affords additional evidence of the early date of the Apocalypse. Such a claim could hardly have been put forward at a later date. But at the earlier periods such troublers of the Church were only too common (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-14.htm" title="And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.">2Corinthians 11:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm" title="Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.">Galatians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2-3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Owing to the inaccurate use of a corrupt text, the Authorized Version is here very faulty. The Revised Version is to be preferred throughout. <span class="cmt_word">I know thy works</span>. This introductory "I know" appears in all seven letters. He whose eyes are "as a flame of fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>) has perfect knowledge of his servants, and this knowledge is the basis of the praise and blame. "Works," a favourite word with St. John, and very frequent in both Gospel and Apocalypse, is used in a wide sense, including the whole of conduct (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39, 41</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8, 12</a> 2John 11 <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-10.htm">3 John 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy toil and patience</span>. Explanatory of "thy works;" the Ephesians know how to toil and how to suffer patiently. They have "learned to labour and to wait." St. Ignatius says that he must be trained "in patience and long suffering" by the Ephesians ('Ephes.,' 3.). <span class="cmt_word">And that thou canst not bear evil men</span>. Again St. Ignatius supplies a commentary: "Now, Onesimus of his own accord highly praiseth your orderly conduct in God, for that ye all live according to truth, and that <span class="accented">no</span> <span class="accented">heresy hath a home among you</span>; nay, ye <span class="accented">do not so much as listen to any one</span>, if he speak of aught else save concerning Jesus Christ in truth" ('Ephes.,' 6.). The word for "evil" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), though one of the commonest in the Greek language, is rare in St. John; it occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a> (see note); <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-23.htm">John 18:23</a> 3John 11. <span class="cmt_word">Didst try them which call themselves apostles, and they are not</span>. It is incredible that this can mean St. Paul. Even allowing the prodigious assumption that the "Jewish Christianity" of St. John was opposed to the "Gentile Christianity" of St. Paul, what chance would an opponent of St. Paul have had in a Church which St. Paul founded and fostered? And had such opposition existed, could St. Polycarp, St. John's own disciple, have spoken of "the wisdom of the blessed and glorious Paul" ('Philippians,' 3.)? This mention of false apostles is doubly interesting: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a fulfilment of warnings given by St. Paul himself to the Ephesian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28-30</a>; comp. 2 Timothy, <span class="accented">passim</span>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as a strong incidental mark of the date of the book. In A.D. , when contemporaries of the apostles were abundant, the claim to be an apostle might with some show of reason be made; in A.D. such a claim would be ridiculous. This Trench admits, and hence tells us that the meaning of "apostles" must not be pressed, "as though it implied a claim to have seen and been sent by the Lord Jesus," But this is just what "apostle" does imply (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 These churches were in such different states as to purity of doctrine and the power of godliness, that the words of Christ to them will always suit the cases of other churches, and professors. Christ knows and observes their state; though in heaven, yet he walks in the midst of his churches on earth, observing what is wrong in them, and what they want. The church of Ephesus is commended for diligence in duty. Christ keeps an account of every hour's work his servants do for him, and their labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. But it is not enough that we are diligent; there must be bearing patience, and there must be waiting patience. And though we must show all meekness to all men, yet we must show just zeal against their sins. The sin Christ charged this church with, is, not the having left and forsaken the object of love, but having lost the fervent degree of it that at first appeared. Christ is displeased with his people, when he sees them grow remiss and cold toward him. Surely this mention in Scripture, of Christians forsaking their first love, reproves those who speak of it with carelessness, and thus try to excuse indifference and sloth in themselves and others; our Saviour considers this indifference as sinful. They must repent: they must be grieved and ashamed for their sinful declining, and humbly confess it in the sight of God. They must endeavour to recover their first zeal, tenderness, and seriousness, and must pray as earnestly, and watch as diligently, as when they first set out in the ways of God. If the presence of Christ's grace and Spirit is slighted, we may expect the presence of his displeasure. Encouraging mention is made of what was good among them. Indifference as to truth and error, good and evil, may be called charity and meekness, but it is not so; and it is displeasing to Christ. The Christian life is a warfare against sin, Satan, the world, and the flesh. We must never yield to our spiritual enemies, and then we shall have a glorious triumph and reward. All who persevere, shall derive from Christ, as the Tree of life, perfection and confirmation in holiness and happiness, not in the earthly paradise, but in the heavenly. This is a figurative expression, taken from the account of the garden of Eden, denoting the pure, satisfactory, and eternal joys of heaven; and the looking forward to them in this world, by faith, communion with Christ, and the consolations of the Holy Spirit. Believers, take your wrestling life here, and expect and look for a quiet life hereafter; but not till then: the word of God never promises quietness and complete freedom from conflict here.</body></html>
