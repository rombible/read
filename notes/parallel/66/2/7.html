In the first three, however, they are placed before the promise; in the remaining four they follow it. The heart which is hardened is the precursor of the ear that is deaf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm" title="To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot listen: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.">Jeremiah 6:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-37.htm" title="But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:">John 12:37-40</a>).

The word--used but once in the three Gospels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-22.htm" title="But when a stronger than he shall come on him, and overcome him, he takes from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divides his spoils.">Luke 11:22</a>), and but once by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-21.htm" title="Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.">Romans 12:21</a>)--is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm" title="These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.">John 16:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.">1John 2:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-4.htm" title="For whatever is born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.">1John 5:4-5</a>; and occurs in all these epistles to the churches. The promise of the tree of life is appropriate (1) to the virtue commended: those who had not indulged in the license of Nicolaitanes shall eat of the tree of life; (2) to the special weakness of the Ephesians: to those who had fallen, and lost the paradise of first loving communion and fellowship with God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm" title="And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.">Genesis 3:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1John 1:3</a>), is held out the promise of a restored paradise and participation in the tree of life. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm" title="In the middle of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.">Revelation 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm" title="And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:">Genesis 3:22</a>.) This boon of immortality is the gift of Christ--I will <span class= "ital">give.</span> It is tasted in knowledge of God and of His Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>); it is enjoyed in their presence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3-4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath an ear, let him hear</span>. These solemn conclusions of these epistles remind us of the conclusion of many of Christ's parables (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-9.htm">Matthew 13:9, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9, 23</a>, [7:16]; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-8.htm">Luke 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-35.htm">Luke 14:35</a>; not in St. John's Gospel, in which there are no parables). It is very noteworthy that, although the epistle is addressed in each case to a Church in the person of its angel, yet the concluding exhortation and promise are always addressed to the individual Christian. Each must hear for himself. His Church may perish, yet, if he overcomes, he shall live. His Church may be crowned with eternal life, yet, if he is overcome, he will lose the reward. <span class="cmt_word">What the Spirit saith to the Churches</span>; not "what he saith to <span class="accented">this</span> Church." The contents of each epistle are for all; for each individual Christian and for the Church at large, as well as for the particular Church addressed in the epistle. The epistle in each case is not from John, who is only the instrument, but from the Son of God and from the Spirit of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). In the first three epistles the exhortation to hearken <span class="accented">precedes</span> the promise to the victor; in the four last it <span class="accented">follows</span> the promise, and closes the epistle. Is this change of arrangement accidental or deliberate? There should be a full stop at "Churches." In the Authorized Version it looks as if "what the Spirit saith" were confined to the promise in the second half of the verse. This error was avoided by Tyndale and Cranmer. It comes from the Genevan and the Rhemish Versions. The verb to "overcome" or "conquer" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>) is strongly characteristic of St. John. It occurs seven times in the Gospel and the First Epistle, and sixteen times in the Revelation; elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-22.htm">Luke 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a> (quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) and Romans 12:21; comp. especially Revelation 21:7, where, as in these epistles, it is not stated <span class="accented">what</span> is to be overcome. We might render, "to the victor," or "to the conqueror." The expression, "tree of life," of course comes from Genesis; we have it again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2, 14</a>. It means the tree which gives life. So also "the water of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>) and "the bread of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). In all these cases "life" is <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, the vital principle which man shares with God, not <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the life which he shares with his fellow men. The latter word occurs less than a dozen times in the New Testament; the former, which sums up the New Testament, occurs more than a hundred times. The Paradise of God. The word "Paradise" occurs only thrice in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>). It is of Persian origin, and signified a park or pleasure ground. In the New Testament it seems to mean the resting place of departed saints. There is strong evidence (B, versions, Cyprian, Origen) in favour of reading, "the Paradise of <span class="accented">my</span> God" (see notes on Revelation 3:2, 12). In considering this passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a> should be carefully compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>. "For him who conquers" the curse which barred Adam from the tree of life will be revoked by Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 These churches were in such different states as to purity of doctrine and the power of godliness, that the words of Christ to them will always suit the cases of other churches, and professors. Christ knows and observes their state; though in heaven, yet he walks in the midst of his churches on earth, observing what is wrong in them, and what they want. The church of Ephesus is commended for diligence in duty. Christ keeps an account of every hour's work his servants do for him, and their labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. But it is not enough that we are diligent; there must be bearing patience, and there must be waiting patience. And though we must show all meekness to all men, yet we must show just zeal against their sins. The sin Christ charged this church with, is, not the having left and forsaken the object of love, but having lost the fervent degree of it that at first appeared. Christ is displeased with his people, when he sees them grow remiss and cold toward him. Surely this mention in Scripture, of Christians forsaking their first love, reproves those who speak of it with carelessness, and thus try to excuse indifference and sloth in themselves and others; our Saviour considers this indifference as sinful. They must repent: they must be grieved and ashamed for their sinful declining, and humbly confess it in the sight of God. They must endeavour to recover their first zeal, tenderness, and seriousness, and must pray as earnestly, and watch as diligently, as when they first set out in the ways of God. If the presence of Christ's grace and Spirit is slighted, we may expect the presence of his displeasure. Encouraging mention is made of what was good among them. Indifference as to truth and error, good and evil, may be called charity and meekness, but it is not so; and it is displeasing to Christ. The Christian life is a warfare against sin, Satan, the world, and the flesh. We must never yield to our spiritual enemies, and then we shall have a glorious triumph and reward. All who persevere, shall derive from Christ, as the Tree of life, perfection and confirmation in holiness and happiness, not in the earthly paradise, but in the heavenly. This is a figurative expression, taken from the account of the garden of Eden, denoting the pure, satisfactory, and eternal joys of heaven; and the looking forward to them in this world, by faith, communion with Christ, and the consolations of the Holy Spirit. Believers, take your wrestling life here, and expect and look for a quiet life hereafter; but not till then: the word of God never promises quietness and complete freedom from conflict here.</body></html>
