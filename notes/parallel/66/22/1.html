The river is full of water, and that water is the emblem of life: it is the beautiful symbol of life in its gladness, purity, activity, and fulness. The garden of Eden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm" title="And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became into four heads.">Genesis 2:10</a>) had its river. Even in the wilderness Israel had from the smitten rock the water which gushed out like a river (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-41.htm" title="He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.">Psalm 105:41</a>). Prophets, in their pictures of the ages of blessing, almost invariably introduced the river, or broad stream. Joel saw a fountain out of the house of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>). Zechariah spoke of living waters from Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>); but Ezekiel had the fullest vision when he beheld the stream which deepened and broadened in its onward progress from under the threshold of the house of God, and carried life in its train: everything lived whither the water came (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every thing that lives, which moves, wherever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live where the river comes.">Ezekiel 47:9</a>); thus did all prophets speak of the river of God's pleasures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm" title="They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house; and you shall make them drink of the river of your pleasures.">Psalm 36:8</a>). The teaching of our Lord threw new light on the prophetic imagery; the pure delights of spiritual joy and communion with God were vouchsafed to men by the presence of the Holy Spirit, the Giver of Life. In the bestowal of that spirit of life did Christ give true satisfaction to the thirsting souls of men. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.">John 4:10-14, Joh_7:37-39</a>.) The source of the river is in the <span class= "ital">throne.</span> Ezekiel's river took rise in the temple; but in our vision there is no temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm" title="And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.">Revelation 21:22</a>). We are brought nearer, even to the throne: it is the throne (not "thrones")--one throne of God and the Lamb. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he showed me a pure river.</span> Omit "pure." "And" connects this part of the vision with what precedes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9-27</a>). It would have been better, perhaps, if the twenty-first chapter had included the first five verses of the twenty-second, so as to take in the whole of the description of the heavenly Jerusalem. But there is a break at this point, as is indicated by the repetition of "And he showed me," which points to a new phase or section of the vision. In the previous section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9-27</a>) the angel had showed St. John the city and its wails with their gates and foundations; in this section he shows him the river of the water of life, and the tree of life. The latter part of each section is occupied with the evangelist's own observations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3-5</a>), for we cannot suppose that the phrase, "these words," in ver. 6, is intended to apply specially to anything in these particular sections. <span class="accented">He</span> is the angel mentioned in ver. 9, and again referred to in vers. 10, 15, 16, 17. Most probably the pronoun "he" in ver. 6 does not refer to the same angel as this one. <span class="accented">River.</span> The source of this stream, its course or channel, and its fertile banks, are mentioned or implied in what follows; but there is no reference to any estuary or mouth: eternity is the ocean in which this river is lost. <span class="cmt_word">Of water of life.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f5d;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> is perhaps identical in meaning with "living water," <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, but is properly distinguished from it in translation. The two expressions are peculiar to St. John's writings in the New Testament; the genitival form, which is the more Hebraizing, only occurs in this book in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1, 17</a>; whereas the participial and more classical form is confined to the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>). "Living water," in its simplest literalness, means such water as is pure, flowing, clear, fresh, and wholesome; not stagnant, or turbid, or salt. Hence it is a proper term for the water of a beautiful and fertilizing river. Here, however, the genitival form reminds us of the familiar expression, similarly moulded, "the tree of life," which inclines us to think that" water of life" signifies water possessing life giving powers, water which restores, refreshes, supports life, and is therefore to be compared with "living water" taken in its spiritual sense. Of this whosoever drinketh shall never thirst again; when it has been once received within the soul, it becomes a well of water springing up into everlasting life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">clear</span>, or <span class="accented">transparent.</span> We seldom use the rendering of the Revised Version, <span class="accented">bright</span>, as an epithet of water. <span class="accented">As crystal</span> (see note on Revelation 4:6, the only other place in the New Testament where the word occurs). The source of the river was in the Divine throne, the seat of the Triune God and the crucified Saviour. All eternal life is derived from our heavenly Father by the Holy Spirit for the sake of the Redeemer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 All streams of earthly comfort are muddy; but these are clear, and refreshing. They give life, and preserve life, to those who drink of them, and thus they will flow for evermore. These point to the quickening and sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit, as given to sinners through Christ. The Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, applies this salvation to our souls by his new-creating love and power. The trees of life are fed by the pure waters of the river that comes from the throne of God. The presence of God in heaven, is the health and happiness of the saints. This tree was an emblem of Christ, and of all the blessings of his salvation; and the leaves for the healing of the nations, mean that his favour and presence supply all good to the inhabitants of that blessed world. The devil has no power there; he cannot draw the saints from serving God, nor can he disturb them in the service of God. God and the Lamb are here spoken of as one. Service there shall be not only freedom, but honour and dominion. There will be no night; no affliction or dejection, no pause in service or enjoyment: no diversions or pleasures or man's inventing will there be wanted. How different all this from gross and merely human views of heavenly happiness, even those which refer to pleasures of the mind!</body></html>
