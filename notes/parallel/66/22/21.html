We ought probably to read, <span class= "ital">The grace of the Lord Jesus</span> <span class= "ital">Christ be with all</span> (or else, following the Sinaitic MS., <span class= "ital">be with the saints</span>)<span class= "ital">. Amen.</span> In any case, it is the grace or free pardon of the Lord Jesus which is the last word left in our ears. It reminds us that whatever be the dangers or difficulties, the afflictions or persecutions which have been pictured in the book, there is strength and love in the Lord; it reminds us that whether we are readers or interpreters of this book, or whether we are trying to carry out its teachings practically in daily life, our power and wisdom must come from Him. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. Without Him it had not been written; without Him it cannot be understood; without Him it cannot be obeyed. This grace of Christ our Lord, for mind and heart and life, the writer prays may rest with those who read this Commentary, that they may be led into deeper knowledge of Him who is our life. The writer asks the reader to pray that this grace of Christ may rest in forgiveness and love upon him who has now finished his task of commenting on this book, whose hidden meanings must far transcend our knowledge and our expectations. May He (He alone can) open our eyes to see the shining towers of the Heavenly Jerusalem; may He unseal our ears to hear the heavenly music to which it is being built; may He bind us by His love to that sweet service and citizenship which is perfect freedom, and bring us to that spiritual city which is full of divine enchantments--<p>"For there is nothing in it as it seems<p>Saving the King; though some there be that hold<p>The King a shadow, and the city real;<p>Yet take thou heed of Him, for, so thou pass<p>Beneath this archway, then wilt thou become<p>A thrall to His enchantments, for the King<p>Will bind thee by such vows as is a shame<p>A man should not be bound by, yet the which<p>No man can keep; but so thou dread to swear,<p>Pass not beneath this gateway, but abide<p>Without among the cattle of the field.<p>For, an ye heard a music, like enow<p>They are building still, seeing the city is built<p>To music, therefore never built at all,<p>And therefore built for ever."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen;</span> <span class="accented">the grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints. Amen.</span> So the delivery of the message was commenced (cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; cf. the form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-28.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:28</a>). Bearing in mind that the theme of the book is the conflict between good and evil, we may well conclude our study of it by joining in the prayer of the author, that the help of the Lord Jesus may be on the side of his saints to enable them to overcome, and then receive their reward. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:20,21 After discovering these things to his people on earth, Christ seems to take leave of them, and return to heaven; but he assures them it shall not be long before he comes again. And while we are busy in the duties of our different stations of life; whatever labours may try us, whatever difficulties may surround us, whatever sorrows may press us down, let us with pleasure hear our Lord proclaiming, Behold, I come quickly; I come to put an end to the labour and suffering of my servants. I come, and my reward of grace is with me, to recompense, with royal bounty, every work of faith and labour of love. I come to receive my faithful, persevering people to myself, to dwell for ever in that blissful world. Amen, even so, come, Lord Jesus. A blessing closes the whole. By the grace of Christ we must be kept in joyful expectation of his glory, fitted for it, and preserved to it; and his glorious appearance will be joyful to those who partake of his grace and favour here. Let all add, Amen. Let us earnestly thirst after greater measures of the gracious influences of the blessed Jesus in our souls, and his gracious presence with us, till glory has made perfect his grace toward us. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</body></html>
