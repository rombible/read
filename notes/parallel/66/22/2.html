The tree of life, as well as the river of life, is to be found in the new and better Eden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-9.htm" title="And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.">Genesis 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm" title="And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:">Genesis 3:22</a>). The vision of Ezekiel is exactly parallel to the present: "On the border of the river there was wood very much, on both sides: every kind of tree; its leaf withers not, and its fruit ceases not; all months does it ripen; its fruit serves for food, and its leaf for healing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-7.htm" title="Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.">Ezekiel 47:7-12</a>). The twelve manner of fruit: The recurrence of the number--twelve--is to be noticed, for here, too, as well as in the foundations and gates of the city, we have variety allied with unity. Diverse and seasonable fruits, and yet one tree of life. Thus does the Almighty wisdom feed His people with food convenient for them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-8.htm" title="Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:">Proverbs 30:8</a>), though, in one sense there is but one food for all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-31.htm" title="Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.">John 6:31</a>); for true divine wisdom is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm" title="She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and happy is every one that retains her.">Proverbs 3:18</a>). That wisdom is not the mere knowledge of things (the tree of the knowledge of good and evil has no place in new Eden); but it is rather the knowledge of life which makes the knowledge of things available to the highest good. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:">1Corinthians 1:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">James 3:17</a>; Proverbs 8)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the street of it.</span> This sentence appears to belong to the preceding verse, as in the Revised Version. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, "and," which follows, seems the beginning of the fresh feature of the description (cf. ver. 1); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the account here given is evidently derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47.htm">Ezekiel 47</a>, where the river is connected with trees, but no such mention is made of <span class="accented">streets. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And on either side of the river, was there the tree of life;</span> <span class="accented">and on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life.</span> The beginning of the new sentence (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). The singular "tree" seems intended to be understood generically of the whole of that class of trees. For this reason probably the LXX. renders the Hebrew of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a> by the plural "trees." We may see in this bountiful supply of the trees of life an image of the abundance of grace and life in store for the redeemed (cf. the description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47.htm">Ezekiel 47</a>.). Which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; rather, <span class="accented">twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one crop m each month. The number <span class="accented">twelve</span> signifies completeness (see on Revelation 4:9; 7:4-9, etc.). This fruit is yielded twelve times as often as ordinary fruit. The signification, therefore, is that there is an ever present supply. The <span class="accented">fruit</span> is not of twelve different kinds; the tree of life bears but one kind (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>. "And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months"). And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>, quoted above, "And the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine"). "The nations" are not the heathen, but the multitude of the redeemed, gathered out of every nation (see on Revelation 21:24). It is, of course, not implied that there is, in the new Jerusalem, any disease which needs healing, but the tree of life is put forward as the means by which the perpetual health and life and general well being of the inhabitants are sustained. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 All streams of earthly comfort are muddy; but these are clear, and refreshing. They give life, and preserve life, to those who drink of them, and thus they will flow for evermore. These point to the quickening and sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit, as given to sinners through Christ. The Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, applies this salvation to our souls by his new-creating love and power. The trees of life are fed by the pure waters of the river that comes from the throne of God. The presence of God in heaven, is the health and happiness of the saints. This tree was an emblem of Christ, and of all the blessings of his salvation; and the leaves for the healing of the nations, mean that his favour and presence supply all good to the inhabitants of that blessed world. The devil has no power there; he cannot draw the saints from serving God, nor can he disturb them in the service of God. God and the Lamb are here spoken of as one. Service there shall be not only freedom, but honour and dominion. There will be no night; no affliction or dejection, no pause in service or enjoyment: no diversions or pleasures or man's inventing will there be wanted. How different all this from gross and merely human views of heavenly happiness, even those which refer to pleasures of the mind!</body></html>
