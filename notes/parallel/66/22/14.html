If we adopt, as we probably ought, this reading, the line of thought suggested above is helped forward: there is in Him who is the First and the Last, refuge from the power of sin and law against which such solemn warning has been given. The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin: the best who have striven and conquered were victors not by their own might, but by the blood of the Lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-11.htm" title="And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death.">Revelation 12:11</a>). If, however, we follow the Received text, we have a benediction which echoes the blessing promised to obedience in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm" title="Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.">Revelation 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a> : this echoing of promises from point to point is in harmony with the spirit of the whole epilogue. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm" title="Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.">Revelation 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm" title="Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.">Revelation 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a>.) The special blessing held out to those who wash their robes (or do His commandments) is the right or authority over the tree of life. <span class= "ital">Blessed are they</span> . . . <span class= "ital">that they may have</span> (and continue to have) <span class= "ital">authority over the tree of life, and that they may enter in by the gates into the city.</span> Admission into the city by the gate, which is of one pearl, and the continuous access to the tree of life, are the privileges of the faithful; and these privileges are free to all, for warnings do not forfeit privileges, but rather do they urge us to use them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are they that do his commandments.</span> The Revised Version adopts the reading, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "they that wash their robes," which is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, 1, 33, Vulgate, AEthiopic, Armenian, Primasius, and which is probably correct. The reading of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "they that do his commandments," is found in B, Syriac, Coptic, etc. The Vulgate adds, "in the blood of the Lamb," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>, which is, of course, the full meaning. The free will of man is implied in the active form of the participle. <span class="cmt_word">That they may have right to the tree of life;</span> <span class="accented">in order that they may have authority over the tree of life</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the right to partake of it. Ebrard makes this clause dependent (as a consequence) upon "do:" "They do them in order that they may have," etc. Others attach this clause to "blessed: They are blessed because they may have the right," etc. Both significations may well be implied. "The tree of life" is that described in ver. 2, and promised "to him that overcometh" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And may enter in through the gates into the city;</span> <span class="accented">by the portals</span>; that is, in the natural way of people who have a right to enter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:6-19 The Lord Jesus spake by the angel, solemnly confirming the contents of this book, particularly of this last vision. He is the Lord God faithful and true. Also by his messengers; the holy angels showed them to holy men of God. They are things that must shortly be done; Christ will come quickly, and put all things out of doubt. And by the integrity of that angel who had been the apostle's interpreter. He refused to accept religious worship from John, and reproved him for offering it. This presents another testimony against idolatrous worship of saints and angels. God calls every one to witness to the declarations here made. This book, thus kept open, will have effect upon men; the filthy and unjust will be more so, but it will confirm, strengthen, and further sanctify those who are upright with God. Never let us think that a dead or disobedient faith will save us, for the First and the Last has declared that those alone are blessed who do his commandments. It is a book that shuts out form heaven all wicked and unrighteous persons, particularly those who love and make lies, therefore cannot itself be a lie. There is no middle place or condition. Jesus, who is the Spirit of prophecy, has given his churches this morning-light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of the perfect day approaching. All is confirmed by an open and general invitation to mankind, to come and partake freely of the promises and of the privileges of the gospel. The Spirit, by the sacred word, and by convictions and influence in the sinner's conscience, says, Come to Christ for salvation; and the bride, or the whole church, on earth and in heaven, says, Come and share our happiness. Lest any should hesitate, it is added, Let whosoever will, or, is willing, come and take of the water of life freely. May every one who hears or reads these words, desire at once to accept the gracious invitation. All are condemned who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, either by adding to it, or taking from it.</body></html>
