Now we have the confirmatory testimony of the seer to the truth of the vision. The declaration reminds us of the opening of the Epistle of St. John: "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1-3</a>). It is no mere dream or ingenious fancy of his own that he has recorded; it is a veritable revelation.<p><span class= "bld">And when I had heard . . .</span>--Or better, <span class= "ital">When I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who was showing me these things.</span> Wonder and awe took possession of the seer, and for the second time he was about to offer unlawful homage to the angel-minister. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>.) This twice offered and twice refused worship is full of teaching. To render to all their due is wise and seemly and Christ-like; to offer exaggerated homage to any is to invert God's order, and to degrade by pretending to exalt man, whose true glory is that he is God's creation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I John saw these things, and heard them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and I John</span> [<span class="accented">am</span>] <span class="accented">the</span> [one] <span class="accented">hearing and seeing these things.</span> The absence of the verb (the present participle being used alone) indicates the person to whom the revelation is made, without assigning any specific period as the particular time when the revelation took place. The same statement is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a> (which see). "These things" are all that have been related in the book. <span class="cmt_word">And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things;</span> <span class="accented">and when I heard and saw</span>, etc. The tense here becomes aorist (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). St. John has once before fallen into the same error, viz. that of paying undue homage to the angel (see on Revelation 19:10). The beatific vision overwhelms him with awe, and he is bowed down with his own humility. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:6-19 The Lord Jesus spake by the angel, solemnly confirming the contents of this book, particularly of this last vision. He is the Lord God faithful and true. Also by his messengers; the holy angels showed them to holy men of God. They are things that must shortly be done; Christ will come quickly, and put all things out of doubt. And by the integrity of that angel who had been the apostle's interpreter. He refused to accept religious worship from John, and reproved him for offering it. This presents another testimony against idolatrous worship of saints and angels. God calls every one to witness to the declarations here made. This book, thus kept open, will have effect upon men; the filthy and unjust will be more so, but it will confirm, strengthen, and further sanctify those who are upright with God. Never let us think that a dead or disobedient faith will save us, for the First and the Last has declared that those alone are blessed who do his commandments. It is a book that shuts out form heaven all wicked and unrighteous persons, particularly those who love and make lies, therefore cannot itself be a lie. There is no middle place or condition. Jesus, who is the Spirit of prophecy, has given his churches this morning-light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of the perfect day approaching. All is confirmed by an open and general invitation to mankind, to come and partake freely of the promises and of the privileges of the gospel. The Spirit, by the sacred word, and by convictions and influence in the sinner's conscience, says, Come to Christ for salvation; and the bride, or the whole church, on earth and in heaven, says, Come and share our happiness. Lest any should hesitate, it is added, Let whosoever will, or, is willing, come and take of the water of life freely. May every one who hears or reads these words, desire at once to accept the gracious invitation. All are condemned who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, either by adding to it, or taking from it.</body></html>
