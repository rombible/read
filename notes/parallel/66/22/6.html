The concluding portion of the book is now entered upon; it contains a brief summary of (or rather reference to) the chief events which have been narrated, and enforces the lesson which is intended to be taught, viz. that Christians should persevere in well doing amid all persecutions, for their reward is certain, and that the punishment due to the wicked will surely overtake them at last. The angel asserts the veracity of what is contained in the book (ver. 6; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>); the time in which to prepare is brief (vers. 6, 7, 12; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3, 7</a>); the prophecy is to be communicated to others (ver. 10; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1-3</a>); God is eternal (ver. 13; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>); the just are rewarded (vers. 14, 17; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>); the wicked are punished (ver. 15; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>); the prophecy is to be faithfully handed on (vers. 18, 19; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These sayings are faithful and true.</span> That is, all that has been conveyed to the seer (cf. the following verses).

He is the Lord God faithful and true. Also by his messengers; the holy angels showed them to holy men of God. They are things that must shortly be done; Christ will come quickly, and put all things out of doubt. And by the integrity of that angel who had been the apostle's interpreter. He refused to accept religious worship from John, and reproved him for offering it. This presents another testimony against idolatrous worship of saints and angels. God calls every one to witness to the declarations here made. This book, thus kept open, will have effect upon men; the filthy and unjust will be more so, but it will confirm, strengthen, and further sanctify those who are upright with God. Never let us think that a dead or disobedient faith will save us, for the First and the Last has declared that those alone are blessed who do his commandments. It is a book that shuts out form heaven all wicked and unrighteous persons, particularly those who love and make lies, therefore cannot itself be a lie. There is no middle place or condition. Jesus, who is the Spirit of prophecy, has given his churches this morning-light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of the perfect day approaching. All is confirmed by an open and general invitation to mankind, to come and partake freely of the promises and of the privileges of the gospel. The Spirit, by the sacred word, and by convictions and influence in the sinner's conscience, says, Come to Christ for salvation; and the bride, or the whole church, on earth and in heaven, says, Come and share our happiness. Lest any should hesitate, it is added, Let whosoever will, or, is willing, come and take of the water of life freely. May every one who hears or reads these words, desire at once to accept the gracious invitation. All are condemned who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, either by adding to it, or taking from it.</body></html>
