And he tells us of what he bore record--of the Word of God. The writer declares that the substance of his testimony and witness had been this Word of God. We have here an indication of what the general character of his teaching had been. It evidently had been a teaching laying stress on that aspect of truth which is so forcibly set before us in the Fourth Gospel and the Epistles bearing the name of John.

"To bear witness" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) and "witness," or "testimony" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), are characteristic of St. John's writings, and serve to connect together his Gospel, the First Epistle, and the Apocalypse. Such words should be carefully noted, and, so far as possible, uniformly translated, in order to mark their frequency in the English Version. The Authorized Version rings the changes on "bear witness," "bear record," "give record," and "testify," for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>; and on "witness," "record," and "testimony," for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The Revised Version has here made great improvements. To bear witness to the truth and the Word of God was St. John's special function throughout his long life, and to this fact he calls attention in all his chief writings (see Haupt on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The testimony of Jesus Christ</span>, like "the Revelation of Jesus Christ" (ver. 1), means that which he gave, not that which tells about him. <span class="cmt_word">And of all things that he saw</span>; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">even of all things that he saw</span>, taking <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f35;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in apposition with what precedes. The seer is here speaking of the visions of the Apocalypse, not of the events in Christ's life. The aorists, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f35;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, are rightly compared to the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> of Thucydides (1:1; 6:7, 93). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 This book is the Revelation of Jesus Christ; the whole Bible is so; for all revelation comes through Christ, and all relates to him. Its principal subject is to discover the purposes of God concerning the affairs of the church, and of the nations as connected therewith, to the end of the world. These events would surely come to pass; and they would begin to come to pass very shortly. Though Christ is himself God, and has light and life in himself, yet, as Mediator between God and man, he receives instructions from the Father. To him we owe the knowledge of what we are to expect from God, and what he expects from us. The subject of this revelation was, the things that must shortly come to pass. On all who read or hear the words of the prophecy, a blessing is pronounced. Those are well employed who search the Bible. It is not enough that we read and hear, but we must keep the things that are written, in our memories, in our minds, in our affections, and in practice, and we shall be blessed in the deed. Even the mysteries and difficulties of this book are united with discoveries of God, suited to impress the mind with awe, and to purify the soul of the reader, though he may not discern the prophetic meaning. No part of Scripture more fully states the gospel, and warns against the evil of sin.</body></html>
