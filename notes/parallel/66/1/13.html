He was present the same as He had been known on earth, yet different--the same, for He is seen as Son of Man; the same as He had been seen on the Resurrection evening; the same as He appeared to Stephen; the same Jesus, caring for, helping and counselling His people: yet different, for He is arrayed in the apparel of kingly and priestly dignity. He is robed to the foot with the long garment of the high priest. St. John uses the same word which is used in the LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31</a>, to describe the robe of the Ephod. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-4.htm" title="And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with change of raiment.">Zechariah 3:4</a>.) It has been understood by some, however, to indicate the "ample robe of judicial and kingly power." There is in the vision a combination of both thoughts. He is the King-Priest who is seen by the Evangelist, the Melchisedec whom the Epistle to the Hebrews had so gloriously set forth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-9.htm" title="And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;">Hebrews 5:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>; especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1-17</a>). He is girt about the breasts with a golden girdle. The girdle is not around the loins, as though ready for action and toil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;">Luke 12:35</a>), but it is worn as by one who rests from toil in the "repose of sovereignty." So, according to Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> iii. 7, ? 2), the Levitical priests were girdled. The girdle is of gold; not interwoven with gold, as was the high priest's girdle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-8.htm" title="And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is on it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.">Exodus 28:8</a>), but pure gold, the emblem of a royal presence. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-5.htm" title="And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.">Isaiah 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-14.htm" title="Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;">Ephesians 6:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the candlesticks</span>.

It is not certain that the absence of the articles forbids us to render the phrase, "the Son of man;" but it is safer to render, "a son of man." The glorified Messiah still wears that human form by which the beloved disciple had known him before the Ascension (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>). With the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>, the full form, "the Son of man," is used only by the Christ of himself. <span class="cmt_word">A garment down to the feet.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">sc.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">vestis talaris</span>), though frequent in the LXX.

The robe is an official one. The Rhemish renders it "a <span class="accented">priestly</span> garment down to the foote." Compare Joseph's "coat of many colours," which literally means a "coat reaching to the extremities."

The angel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5, 6</a> is described in similar language: "whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21</a>, "I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand"). "Enough is said to indicate that the Son of man claims and fulfils the office which was assigned to the children of Aaron; that he blesses the people in God's Name; that he stands as their Representative before his Father" (F.D. Maurice). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The churches receive their light from Christ and the gospel, and hold it forth to others. They are golden candlesticks; they should be precious and pure; not only the ministers, but the members of the churches; their light should so shine before men, as to engage others to give glory to God. And the apostle saw as though of the Lord Jesus Christ appeared in the midst of the golden candlesticks. He is with his churches always, to the end of the world, filling them with light, and life, and love. He was clothed with a robe down to the feet, perhaps representing his righteousness and priesthood, as Mediator. This vest was girt with a golden girdle, which may denote how precious are his love and affection for his people. His head and hairs white like wool and as snow, may signify his majesty, purity, and eternity. His eyes as a flame of fire, may represent his knowledge of the secrets of all hearts, and of the most distant events. His feet like fine brass burning in a furnace, may denote the firmness of his appointments, and the excellence of his proceedings. His voice as the sound of many waters, may represent the power of his word, to remove or to destroy. The seven stars were emblems of the ministers of the seven churches to which the apostle was ordered to write, and whom Christ upheld and directed. The sword represented his justice, and his word, piercing to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, Heb 4:12. His countenance was like the sun, when it shines clearly and powerfully; its strength too bright and dazzling for mortal eyes to behold. The apostle was overpowered with the greatness of the lustre and glory in which Christ appeared. We may well be contented to walk by faith, while here upon earth. The Lord Jesus spake words of comfort; Fear not. Words of instruction; telling who thus appeared. And his Divine nature; the First and the Last. His former sufferings; I was dead: the very same whom his disciples saw upon the cross. His resurrection and life; I have conquered death, and am partaker of endless life. His office and authority; sovereign dominion in and over the invisible world, as the Judge of all, from whose sentence there is no appeal. Let us listen to the voice of Christ, and receive the tokens of his love, for what can he withhold from those for whose sins he has died? May we then obey his word, and give up ourselves wholly to him who directs all things aright.</body></html>
