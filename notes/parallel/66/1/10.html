In great natures this power is usually strong. Socrates is related to have stood rapt in thought for hours, and even days, unconscious of the midday heat, or the mocking wonder of his comrades. To high-souled men, set upon the spiritual welfare of the race, this power of detaching themselves from the influence of the outward is the result of their earnestness; the things spiritual are to them the real; the things seen are temporal. It is the Holy Spirit alone which can give the power of this spiritual abstraction; but it is through the ordinary use of means that this power is bestowed. In St. John's case it was on the Lord's Day that this spiritual rapture was vouchsafed.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord's day.</span>--There is no ground whatever for the futurist interpretation that this expression refers to the "Day of the Lord," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>. The phrase in this latter passage is totally different. The phrase here is. <span class= "ital">en te kuriake hemera.</span> The adjective is applied by St. Paul (perhaps coined by him for the purpose) to the Lord's Supper: from the Supper it came to be applied to the day on which Christians met for the breaking of bread. The day is still called <span class= "greekheb">???????</span> (<span class= "ital">kuriake</span>) in the Levant. On the Lord's Day the vision came to the Apostle. It was the hour of sweetest, closest communion, when the memories of Christ risen, and the fellowship he had enjoyed at Ephesus, would work on his spirit, and aid in raising him in highest adoration, like St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2Corinthians 12:2-4</a>). When so rapt, he heard a voice, strong, clear, and resonant as a trumpet. The Apostle's voice could not be heard among his beloved flock at Ephesus; but there was a voice which would reach from the exile at Patmos, not to Ephesus and its sister churches, but to all churches and throughout all time. The mouth which persecution closes God opens, and bids it speak to the world. So St. Paul, through the Epistles of his Captivity, still speaks. Luther, by his translation of the Bible, spoke from his confinement at Wartburg; and Bunyan, by his divine allegory, shows how feeble were the walls of his cell at Bedford to silence the voice of God. If speech be silver and silence golden, it is also true in the history of the Church that from the captivity of her teachers she has received her most abiding treasures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was in the Spirit</span>.

This is, therefore, the earliest use of the phrase in this sense. That it means Easter Day or Pentecost is baseless conjecture. The phrase had not yet become common in A.D. , as is shown from St. Paul writing, "on the first of the week" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>), the usual expression in the Gospels and Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>). But from Ignatius onwards, we have a complete chain of evidence that <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> became the regular Christian name for the first day of the week; and <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> is still the name of Sunday in the Levant. "No longer observing sabbaths, but fashioning their lives after the Lord's day" (Ign., 'Magn.,' 9.). Melito, Bishop of Sardis (A.D. 170), wrote a treatise <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' IV. 26:2). Dionysius of Corinth (A.D. 175), in an epistle to the Romans, mentions that the Church of Corinth is that day keeping the Lord's holy day (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' IV. 23:11). Comp. also Clem. Alex., 'Strom.,' VII. 12:98 (p. 377, Potter); Tertull., 'De Con.,' 3. and 'De Idol.,' 14, where <span class="accented">Dominicus dies</span> is obviously a translation of <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>; and fragment 7 of the lost works of Irenaeus. That "the Lord's day" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) in this place is the same as "the day of the Lord" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) is not at all probable. The context is quite against any such meaning as that St. John is spiritually transported to the day of judgment. Contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39, 40, 44, 54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-24.htm">John 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>. Whereas, seeing that the visions which follow are grouped in sevens (the seven candlesticks, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials), the fact that they begin on the first day of the seven is eminently appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Great voice</span>. The voice is evidently Christ's; but throughout the Apocalypse the speaker is frequently not named. By a construction common in Hebrew, "saying" agrees with "trumpet," the nearest substantive, instead of with "voice" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>). "Therefore it is from <span class="accented">behind</span>, for all the symbols and references are to be sought for in the Old Testament" (I. Williams); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-11 It was the apostle's comfort that he did not suffer as an evil-doer, but for the testimony of Jesus, for bearing witness to Christ as the Immanuel, the Saviour; and the Spirit of glory and of God rested upon this persecuted apostle. The day and time when he had this vision was the Lord's day, the Christian sabbath, the first day of the week, observed in remembrance of the resurrection of Christ. Let us who call him Our Lord, honour him on his own day. The name shows how this sacred day should be observed; the Lord's day should be wholly devoted to the Lord, and none of its hours employed in a sensual, worldly manner, or in amusements. He was in a serious, heavenly, spiritual frame, under the gracious influences of the Spirit of God. Those who would enjoy communion with God on the Lord's day, must seek to draw their thoughts and affections from earthly things. And if believers are kept on the Lord's holy day, from public ordinances and the communion of saints, by necessity and not by choice, they may look for comfort in meditation and secret duties, from the influences of the Spirit; and by hearing the voice and contemplating the glory of their beloved Saviour, from whose gracious words and power no confinement or outward circumstances can separate them. An alarm was given as with the sound of the trumpet, and then the apostle heard the voice of Christ.</body></html>
