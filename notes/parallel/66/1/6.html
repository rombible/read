These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,">Exodus 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm" title="And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.">Exodus 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm" title="Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.">Hebrews 9:21</a>). The book will declare the kingship and priesthood of the children of God--a sovereignty over human fears and sufferings--their priesthood in their lives of consecration, and their offering of themselves even unto death.<p>"And all thy saints do overcome<p>By Thy blood and their martyrdom."<p>The doxology here is two-fold: glory and dominion. The doxologies in which the Redeemed Church takes part grow in strength in the earlier chapters of this book. It is three-fold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/4-9.htm" title="And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who lives for ever and ever,">Revelation 4:9-11</a>; four-fold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-13.htm" title="And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.">Revelation 5:13</a>; and it reaches the climax of seven-fold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-12.htm" title="Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be to our God for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 7:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And hath made us kings and priests</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and he made us</span> (to be) <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">kingdom</span>, (to be) <span class="accented">priests.</span> "Made us" is not coordinate with "loosed us;" the sentence makes a fresh start. "Kingdom," not "kings," is the right reading. Christians are nowhere said to be kings. Collectively they are a kingdom - "a kingdom of priests" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), or, as St. Peter, following the LXX., gives it, "a royal priesthood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). Each member of Christ shares in his eternal priesthood. <span class="cmt_word">Unto God and his Father</span>; more probably we should render, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">unto his God and Father</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>). Alford objects that when St. John wishes a possessive genitive to apply to more than one substantive, he commonly repeats the genitive; and he quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-11.htm">John 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-21.htm">John 9:21</a>. But in these passages he repeats not only the genitive, but the article. Here the article is not repeated, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> must be taken as one phrase. <span class="cmt_word">To him be the glory</span>. The construction returns to that of the opening clause, "Unto him that loveth us." St. John's doxologies increase in volume as he progresses - twofold here, threefold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, fourfold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>, sevenfold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>. In each case all the substantives have the article - "<span class="accented">the</span> glory," "the honour," "<span class="accented">the</span> power," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Forever and ever</span>; literally, <span class="accented">unto the ages of the ages</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">in saecula saeculorum</span>). It occurs twelve times in the Apocalypse, besides once without the articles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>). In his Gospel and Epistles St. John uses the simpler formula, "forever," literally, "unto the age" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>). (See Appendix E. to St. John, in the 'Cambridge Greek Testament.') An indefinite period of immense duration is meant (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm">Galatians 1:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2, 7</a>, where the countless ages of the world to come seem to be contrasted with the transitory age of this world; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-21.htm">Hebrews 13:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:4-8 There can be no true peace, where there is not true grace; and where grace goeth before, peace will follow. This blessing is in the name of God, of the Holy Trinity, it is an act of adoration. The Father is first named; he is described as the Jehovah who is, and who was, and who is to come, eternal, unchangeable. The Holy Spirit is called the seven spirits, the perfect Spirit of God, in whom there is a diversity of gifts and operations. The Lord Jesus Christ was from eternity, a Witness to all the counsels of God. He is the First-born from the dead, who will by his own power raise up his people. He is the Prince of the kings of the earth; by him their counsels are overruled, and to him they are accountable. Sin leaves a stain of guilt and pollution upon the soul. Nothing can fetch out this stain but the blood of Christ; and Christ shed his own blood to satisfy Divine justice, and purchase pardon and purity for his people. Christ has made believers kings and priests to God and his Father. As such they overcome the world, mortify sin, govern their own spirits, resist Satan, prevail with God in prayer, and shall judge the world. He has made them priests, given them access to God, enabled them to offer spiritual and acceptable sacrifices, and for these favours they are bound to ascribe to him dominion and glory for ever. He will judge the world. Attention is called to that great day when all will see the wisdom and happiness of the friends of Christ, and the madness and misery of his enemies. Let us think frequently upon the second coming of Christ. He shall come, to the terror of those who wound and crucify him by apostacy: he shall come, to the astonishment of the whole world of the ungodly. He is the Beginning and the End; all things are from him and for him; he is the Almighty; the same eternal and unchanged One. And if we would be numbered with his saints in glory everlasting, we must now willing submit to him receive him, and honour him as a saviour, who we believe will come to be our Judge. Alas, that there should be many, who would wish never to die, and that there should not be a day of judgment!</body></html>
