The description of the verse applies, with little doubt, to our Lord, and the words are a strong declaration of His divinity.<p><span class= "bld">The Almighty.</span>--The word thus rendered is, with one exception (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-18.htm" title="And will be a Father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, said the Lord Almighty.">2Corinthians 6:18</a>), peculiar to this book in the New Testament.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - A prelude to the book. In the simple majesty of its solemn language it reminds us of the opening of St. John's Gospel and of his First Epistle. "I am <span class="accented">the</span> Alpha and <span class="accented">the</span> Omega" is here not followed by "the Beginning and the End," which the Vulgate and some other authorities insert from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a> and Revelation 22:13. Who is "the Lord," that utters these words? Surely the Christ, as seems clear from ver. 17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>. To attribute them to the Father robs the words of their special appropriateness in this context, where they form a prelude to "the Revelation <span class="accented">of Jesus Christ"</span> as God and as the Almighty "Ruler of the kings of the earth." Yet the fact that similar language is also used of the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>) shows how clearly St. John teaches that Jesus Christ is "equal to the Father as touching his Godhead." These sublime attributes are applicable to each. Like the doxology (see on ver. 6), the statement of these Divine attributes increases in fulness as the writing proceeds. Here "the Alpha and the Omega;" ver. 17 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>, "the First and the Last;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>, "the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>, "the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End." Of these four, the second and fourth certainly apply to the Son, and the third certainly to the Father, the first probably to the Son. <span class="cmt_word">The Almighty</span>. With the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-18.htm">2 Corinthians 6:18</a>, where it occurs in a quotation, this expression (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>) is in the New Testament peculiar to the Apocalypse, where it occurs nine times. In the LXX. it represents more than one Hebrew expression; e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:4-8 There can be no true peace, where there is not true grace; and where grace goeth before, peace will follow. This blessing is in the name of God, of the Holy Trinity, it is an act of adoration. The Father is first named; he is described as the Jehovah who is, and who was, and who is to come, eternal, unchangeable. The Holy Spirit is called the seven spirits, the perfect Spirit of God, in whom there is a diversity of gifts and operations. The Lord Jesus Christ was from eternity, a Witness to all the counsels of God. He is the First-born from the dead, who will by his own power raise up his people. He is the Prince of the kings of the earth; by him their counsels are overruled, and to him they are accountable. Sin leaves a stain of guilt and pollution upon the soul. Nothing can fetch out this stain but the blood of Christ; and Christ shed his own blood to satisfy Divine justice, and purchase pardon and purity for his people. Christ has made believers kings and priests to God and his Father. As such they overcome the world, mortify sin, govern their own spirits, resist Satan, prevail with God in prayer, and shall judge the world. He has made them priests, given them access to God, enabled them to offer spiritual and acceptable sacrifices, and for these favours they are bound to ascribe to him dominion and glory for ever. He will judge the world. Attention is called to that great day when all will see the wisdom and happiness of the friends of Christ, and the madness and misery of his enemies. Let us think frequently upon the second coming of Christ. He shall come, to the terror of those who wound and crucify him by apostacy: he shall come, to the astonishment of the whole world of the ungodly. He is the Beginning and the End; all things are from him and for him; he is the Almighty; the same eternal and unchanged One. And if we would be numbered with his saints in glory everlasting, we must now willing submit to him receive him, and honour him as a saviour, who we believe will come to be our Judge. Alas, that there should be many, who would wish never to die, and that there should not be a day of judgment!</body></html>
