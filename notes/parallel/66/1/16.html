The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>) to be the emblems of the angels of the seven churches; they are described as stars in His right hand; they, perhaps, appeared as a wreath, or as a royal and star-adorned diadem in His hand. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-3.htm" title="You shall also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.">Isaiah 62:3</a>.)

Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.">Revelation 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-52.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Put up again your sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.">Matthew 26:52</a>), but those who arm themselves with this will find it mighty through God.

It has the double edge of its power to rebuke sin and self-righteousness; the evil of wrong-doing and the evil motives which wait on right-doing; the two edges of which will cut off sin from man, or else man in his sin. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2Thessalonians 2:8</a>.) The Greek word here rendered "sword" is used six times in this book, and only once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm" title="(Yes, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.">Luke 2:35</a>) elsewhere in the New Testament.<p><span class= "bld">His countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength</span>.--It is the spiritual truth which gives the splendour to such descriptions as these. The dazzling glory of Him who is the Sun of Righteousness is intolerable to human eyes. There is no marvel in this when we remember that He is the brightness of His Father's glory, and that the Father dwells "in that light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1Timothy 6:16</a>). It is the lustre of holiness and righteousness which is here signified, and which "the eye of sinful man may not see," but of which saints and angel messengers may catch a faint reflection; so that the angel's face may look like lightning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm" title="His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:">Matthew 28:3</a>), and "the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-43.htm" title="Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who has ears to hear, let him hear.">Matthew 13:43</a>). (Comp. the shining of Moses' face, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.">Exodus 34:29</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - He holds the Churches in his hand as a precious possession, which he sustains as a glory to himself. These Churches are as planets, which shine, not with their own light, but that of the sun; which shine most brightly in the night of "tribulation," which (like him who holds them in his right hand) are a guide to the wanderer, and are ever moving, yet ever at rest. <span class="cmt_word">Out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword</span>. This metaphor runs through both Old and New Testaments. It is frequent in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15, 21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>, etc.). The sharp words of men and the searching words of God are both spoken of under this figure of the sword. Tertullian and Richard of St. Victor explain the two edges as the Law and the Gospel. Other still more fanciful explanations have been given. "Two-edged" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is literally "two-mouthed," and perhaps expresses no more than the thorough efficiency of the sword. It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; also in classical Greek as equivalent to the more common <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. If a double meaning be insisted on, it may be found in the double character of God's Word, which not only smites the wicked, but searches the good; which cuts sometimes to punish, sometimes to heal. Thus in these very epistles to the Churches, penetrating words both of blessing and condemnation are uttered. The word for "sword" (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs six times in Revelation; elsewhere in the New Testament only <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>. In classical Greek it is the heavy Thracian broadsword. In the LXX. it is used of the "flaming sword" of the cherubim which kept the way of the tree of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); also of the sword of Goliath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>:25). <span class="cmt_word">His countenance was as the sun shineth</span>. It is the "Sun of Righteousness" and "the Light of the world." The exceptional glory of the Transfiguration has become constant now. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The churches receive their light from Christ and the gospel, and hold it forth to others. They are golden candlesticks; they should be precious and pure; not only the ministers, but the members of the churches; their light should so shine before men, as to engage others to give glory to God. And the apostle saw as though of the Lord Jesus Christ appeared in the midst of the golden candlesticks. He is with his churches always, to the end of the world, filling them with light, and life, and love. He was clothed with a robe down to the feet, perhaps representing his righteousness and priesthood, as Mediator. This vest was girt with a golden girdle, which may denote how precious are his love and affection for his people. His head and hairs white like wool and as snow, may signify his majesty, purity, and eternity. His eyes as a flame of fire, may represent his knowledge of the secrets of all hearts, and of the most distant events. His feet like fine brass burning in a furnace, may denote the firmness of his appointments, and the excellence of his proceedings. His voice as the sound of many waters, may represent the power of his word, to remove or to destroy. The seven stars were emblems of the ministers of the seven churches to which the apostle was ordered to write, and whom Christ upheld and directed. The sword represented his justice, and his word, piercing to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, Heb 4:12. His countenance was like the sun, when it shines clearly and powerfully; its strength too bright and dazzling for mortal eyes to behold. The apostle was overpowered with the greatness of the lustre and glory in which Christ appeared. We may well be contented to walk by faith, while here upon earth. The Lord Jesus spake words of comfort; Fear not. Words of instruction; telling who thus appeared. And his Divine nature; the First and the Last. His former sufferings; I was dead: the very same whom his disciples saw upon the cross. His resurrection and life; I have conquered death, and am partaker of endless life. His office and authority; sovereign dominion in and over the invisible world, as the Judge of all, from whose sentence there is no appeal. Let us listen to the voice of Christ, and receive the tokens of his love, for what can he withhold from those for whose sins he has died? May we then obey his word, and give up ourselves wholly to him who directs all things aright.</body></html>
