It is not patience for Christ, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.">2Thessalonians 3:5</a>, nor patience of Christ, but rather patience which draws its life and energy of endurance from Him.<p><span class= "bld">Patmos.</span>--Professor Plumptre notices how little the scenery of Patmos colours the Apocalypse. "The vision that follows is all but unaffected by the external surroundings of the seer. At the farthest, we can but think of the blue waters of the Mediterranean--now purple as wine, now green as emerald, flushing and flashing in the light as the hues on the plumage of a dove." The position of the Apostle in Patmos was probably that of an exile, free to roam where he would within the limits of the island. There was at any rate no limit of chains or guard, as in the case of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>). He tells us what was the cause of his exile. It was his faithfulness in proclaiming, as we know he loved to do, <span class= "ital">the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. "</span>St. John, proclaiming the Word of God, who was before all worlds, who had been made flesh and dwelt among men, who was the King of kings and Lord of lords, struck a blow at the worship as well as the polity of the Roman empire. He opposed the God-man to the man-god" (<span class= "ital">Maurice on the Revel., </span>p. 20). The contest is incessantly the same. False creeds ever aim to deify man. "Ye shall be as gods" is their motto and their bible. "Emmanuel," is the motto of the true faith--<p>"The Lord was God, and came as man; the Pope<p>Is man, and comes as God."--<span class= "ital">Harold.</span><p>The crucified, suffering Saviour, God in Christ, very God, and one with man in sorrow, was the stumbling-block in the past, and is the ideal which offends many now. (See Bp. Alexander's <span class= "ital">Bampton Lectures, </span>p. 30, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) The terms of the conflict remain unchanged through the ages. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-20.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">introductory vision.</span> This section is introductory, not merely to the epistles to the Churches, but to the whole book. In it the seer narrates how he received his commission; and with it should be compared <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10</a>, especially vers. 2, 7, where "I Daniel" is exactly parallel to "I John" here. The Revised Version is again much to be preferred to the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the tribulation and kingdom and patience.</span> The order of the words is surprising; we should have expected "kingdom" to have come first or last. But "and patience" seems to be added epexegetically, to show <span class="accented">how</span> the tribulation leads to the kingdom (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2, 3, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-10.htm">Revelation 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-10.htm">Revelation 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>). "In your patience ye shall win your souls" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-19.htm">Luke 21:19</a>). "Tribulation worketh patience" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>); and "through many tribulations, we must enter into the kingdom of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>). Bengel notes that it is in tribulation that believers specially love this book. The Church of Asia, particularly after the prosperous time of Constantine, had a low opinion of the Apocalypse; while the African Church, which was more subject to persecution, highly esteemed it. "Everything tends to show that the Apocalypse was acknowledged in Africa from the earliest times as canonical Scripture" (Westcott, 'On the Canon of the New Testament,' p. 238). <span class="cmt_word">Was in the isle</span>. Here and in ver. 10 "was" is literally "came to be" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), implying that such was not his ordinary condition; comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-17.htm">2 Timothy 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That is called Patmos</span>. St. John does not assume that his readers know so insignificant a place. He does not say simply "in Patmos," as St. Luke says "to Rhodes" or "to Cyprus," but "in <span class="accented">the isle</span> that is <span class="accented">called</span> Patmos." Now <span class="accented">Patmo</span> or <span class="accented">Patino</span>, but in the Middle Ages <span class="accented">Palmosa.</span> Its small size and rugged character made it a suitable place for penal transportation. Banishment to a small island (<span class="accented">deportatio in insulam</span> or <span class="accented">insulae vinculum</span>) was common. "Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum" (Juv., 1:73). Compare the cases of Agrippa Postumus (Tac., 'Ann.,' 1:3) and of Julia (4:71). For a full account of the island, see Gudrin's 'Description de File de Patmos,' Paris: 1856. For the circumstances of St. John's banishment, see Introduction. It was in exile that Jacob saw God at Bethel; in exile that Moses saw God at the burning bush; in exile that Elijah heard the "still small voice;" in exile that Ezekiel saw "the likeness of the glory of the Lord" by the river Chebar; in exile that Daniel saw "the Ancient of days." <span class="cmt_word">For the Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus</span>. No doubt the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">might</span> mean that he was in Patmos for the sake of <span class="accented">receiving</span> the word; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a> and Revelation 20:4 are decisive against this (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>). These passages and "partaker in the tribulation" here prove that St. John's "coming to be in Patmos" was caused by <span class="accented">suffering</span> for the Word of God. <span class="accented">The testimony of Jesus.</span> This, as in ver. 2, probably means the testimony that he bore, rather than the testimony about him. "Christ" is a corrupt addition to the text in both places in this verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-11 It was the apostle's comfort that he did not suffer as an evil-doer, but for the testimony of Jesus, for bearing witness to Christ as the Immanuel, the Saviour; and the Spirit of glory and of God rested upon this persecuted apostle. The day and time when he had this vision was the Lord's day, the Christian sabbath, the first day of the week, observed in remembrance of the resurrection of Christ. Let us who call him Our Lord, honour him on his own day. The name shows how this sacred day should be observed; the Lord's day should be wholly devoted to the Lord, and none of its hours employed in a sensual, worldly manner, or in amusements. He was in a serious, heavenly, spiritual frame, under the gracious influences of the Spirit of God. Those who would enjoy communion with God on the Lord's day, must seek to draw their thoughts and affections from earthly things. And if believers are kept on the Lord's holy day, from public ordinances and the communion of saints, by necessity and not by choice, they may look for comfort in meditation and secret duties, from the influences of the Spirit; and by hearing the voice and contemplating the glory of their beloved Saviour, from whose gracious words and power no confinement or outward circumstances can separate them. An alarm was given as with the sound of the trumpet, and then the apostle heard the voice of Christ.</body></html>
