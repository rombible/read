The words "which are in Asia," are also omitted.<p><span class= "bld">The seven churches.</span>--There were more than seven churches in Asia Minor; but the number selected indicates completeness. Thus, though having special reference to the conditions of those churches, the epistles may be regarded as epistles conveying ever appropriate lessons to the churches of succeeding ages. The names of the seven churches are enumerated, as they would naturally be by a person writing from Patmos. "First, Ephesus is addressed, as the Asiatic metropolis, and as the nearest church to Patmos; then the other churches on the western coast of Asia; then those in the interior" (Wordsworth).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - On ample evidence (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, C, and all versions), "I am Alpha ... the Last; and" must be omitted; also "which are in Asia." <span class="cmt_word">Write in a book</span>; literally, <span class="accented">into a book</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Over and over again, twelve times in all, St. John reminds us that he writes this book by Divine command (ver. 19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1, 8, 12, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1, 7, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The seven Churches</span>. The order is not haphazard. It is precisely that which would be natural to a person writing in Patmos or travelling from Ephesus. Ephesus comes first as metropolis; then the city on the coast, Smyrna; then the inland cities in order, working round towards Ephesus again. In short, it is just the order in which St. John would visit the Churches in making an apostolic circuit as metropolitan. With the exception of what is told us in these chapters, the history of the Churches of Pergamum, Thyatira, and Sardis in the apostolic or sub-apostolic age is quite unknown. It was an ancient objection to the Apocalypse that in Thyatira there was no Church (see on Revelation 2:18). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:9-11 It was the apostle's comfort that he did not suffer as an evil-doer, but for the testimony of Jesus, for bearing witness to Christ as the Immanuel, the Saviour; and the Spirit of glory and of God rested upon this persecuted apostle. The day and time when he had this vision was the Lord's day, the Christian sabbath, the first day of the week, observed in remembrance of the resurrection of Christ. Let us who call him Our Lord, honour him on his own day. The name shows how this sacred day should be observed; the Lord's day should be wholly devoted to the Lord, and none of its hours employed in a sensual, worldly manner, or in amusements. He was in a serious, heavenly, spiritual frame, under the gracious influences of the Spirit of God. Those who would enjoy communion with God on the Lord's day, must seek to draw their thoughts and affections from earthly things. And if believers are kept on the Lord's holy day, from public ordinances and the communion of saints, by necessity and not by choice, they may look for comfort in meditation and secret duties, from the influences of the Spirit; and by hearing the voice and contemplating the glory of their beloved Saviour, from whose gracious words and power no confinement or outward circumstances can separate them. An alarm was given as with the sound of the trumpet, and then the apostle heard the voice of Christ.</body></html>
