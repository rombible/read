Selah.">Psalm 89:37</a> as the faithful witness. The coincidence of expression is remarkable: "I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth; he shall stand fast as the sun before me, and as the faithful witness in heaven." The idea of testimony and witness is a favourite one with St. John, who records its use by our Lord Himself. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-32.htm" title="And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.">John 3:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.">John 18:37</a>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-18.htm" title="For I testify to every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book:">Revelation 22:18</a>. Comp. also the work of the Only Begotten as stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The prince</span> (or <span class= "ital">ruler</span>) <span class= "bld">of the kings of the earth.</span>--The message does not come from One who will be, but who <span class= "ital">is</span> the true ruler of all earthly potentates. The disposition to dwell on the future and more visibly recognised reign of Christ hereafter has tended to obscure the truth of His present reign. It is instructive to notice that this book, which describes so vividly the manifestations of Christ's kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm" title="And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.">Revelation 12:10</a>), claims for Him at the outset the place of the real King of kings. Such was the Apostle's faith. "Above all emperors and kings, above all armies and multitudes, he thought of the Crucified as ruling and directing the course of history, and certain in His own due time to manifest His sovereignty" (Prof. Plumptre). "What are we to see in the simple Anno Domini of our dates and superscriptions, but that for some reason the great world-history has been bending itself to the lowly person of Jesus" (Bushnell). "A handful read the philosophers; myriads would die for Christ; they in their popularity could barely found a school; Christ from His cross rules the world" (Farrar, <span class= "ital">Witness of History</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Such is a real kingship.<p><span class= "bld">Unto him that loved us, and washed us.</span>--Instead of "washed us," some MSS. read, "loosed us." There is only one letter's difference in the two words in Greek. The general tone of thought would lead us to prefer "washed" as the true reading. On a solemn occasion, which St. John remembered clearly, our Lord had said, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me." The thought of the "cleansing blood," intensified by the recollection of the water and blood which he had seen flowing from Christ's pierced side, often recurred to his mind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/7-13.htm" title="And one of the elders answered, saying to me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and from where came they?">Revelation 7:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1John 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.">1John 5:6-8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The faithful Witness</span>. This was his function - "to bear witness unto the truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). The rainbow is called "the faithful witness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Firstborn of the dead</span>. Christ was the first who was born to eternal life after the death which ends this life (see Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 18</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>). "The ruler of this world" offered Jesus the glory of the kingdoms of the world, if he would worship him. He won a higher glory by dying to conquer him, and thus the crucified Peasant became the Lord of Roman emperors, "the Ruler of the kings of the earth." The grammar of this verse is irregular; "the faithful Witness," etc., in the nominative being in apposition with "Jesus Christ" in the genitive (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto him that loved us</span>. The true reading gives "that <span class="accented">loveth</span> us" unceasingly. The supreme act of dying for us did not exhaust his love. In what follows it is difficult to decide between "washed" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) and "loosed" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), both readings being very well supported; but we should certainly omit "own" before "blood." The blood of Jesus Christ cleansing us from all sin is a frequent thought with the apostle who witnessed the piercing of the side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-13.htm">Revelation 7:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6-8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:4-8 There can be no true peace, where there is not true grace; and where grace goeth before, peace will follow. This blessing is in the name of God, of the Holy Trinity, it is an act of adoration. The Father is first named; he is described as the Jehovah who is, and who was, and who is to come, eternal, unchangeable. The Holy Spirit is called the seven spirits, the perfect Spirit of God, in whom there is a diversity of gifts and operations. The Lord Jesus Christ was from eternity, a Witness to all the counsels of God. He is the First-born from the dead, who will by his own power raise up his people. He is the Prince of the kings of the earth; by him their counsels are overruled, and to him they are accountable. Sin leaves a stain of guilt and pollution upon the soul. Nothing can fetch out this stain but the blood of Christ; and Christ shed his own blood to satisfy Divine justice, and purchase pardon and purity for his people. Christ has made believers kings and priests to God and his Father. As such they overcome the world, mortify sin, govern their own spirits, resist Satan, prevail with God in prayer, and shall judge the world. He has made them priests, given them access to God, enabled them to offer spiritual and acceptable sacrifices, and for these favours they are bound to ascribe to him dominion and glory for ever. He will judge the world. Attention is called to that great day when all will see the wisdom and happiness of the friends of Christ, and the madness and misery of his enemies. Let us think frequently upon the second coming of Christ. He shall come, to the terror of those who wound and crucify him by apostacy: he shall come, to the astonishment of the whole world of the ungodly. He is the Beginning and the End; all things are from him and for him; he is the Almighty; the same eternal and unchanged One. And if we would be numbered with his saints in glory everlasting, we must now willing submit to him receive him, and honour him as a saviour, who we believe will come to be our Judge. Alas, that there should be many, who would wish never to die, and that there should not be a day of judgment!</body></html>
