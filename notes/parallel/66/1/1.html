"John is the writer, but Jesus Christ is the author," says Grotius; and consistently with this the action of Christ is seen throughout. It is Christ who bids John write to the seven churches; it is Christ who opens the seven seals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.">Revelation 6:1</a>), who reveals the sufferings of the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9</a>), who offers the prayers of the saints (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a>), and delivers the little book to John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/10-1.htm" title="And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:">Revelation 10:1-11</a>). Thus it is seen that though the rise and fall of earth's history is included in the revelation, it is a revelation also of a living person; it is not the dull, dead onward flow of circumstances, but the lives of men and nations seen in the light of Him who is the light of every man and the life of all history; and thus we learn that "only a living person can be the Alpha and Omega, the starting-point of creation and its final rest." The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of this prophecy, as of all others. The Father gives this to the Son whom He loves, and shows Him all things that Himself doeth.<p><span class= "bld">Shortly.</span>--On this word much controversy has turned. Its force, "speedily," affords a groundwork, and, it must be admitted, a plausible one, to the praeterist school of interpreters, who hold that the whole range of Apocalyptic predictions was fulfilled within a comparatively short time after the Apostle wrote. The truth, however, seems to be that the words of God are of perpetual fulfilment: they are not only to be fulfilled; they have not only been fulfilled; but they have been and they are being fulfilled; and they yet will be fulfilled; and the principles which are enunciated by the Prophet, though "shortly" fulfilled, are not exhausted in the immediate fulfilment, but carry still lessons for the succeeding generations of mankind.<p><span class= "bld">John</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the Apostle and Evangelist. The arguments in support of this identification are admitted even by the most captious critics to be conclusive. "The Apocalypse, if any book can be traced to him, must be ascribed to the Apostle John" (<span class= "ital">Supernatural Religion</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> (See <span class= "ital">Excursus A.</span>) To many it will seem natural that John, the beloved disciple, should be the recipient of this revelation. Those who have been nearest to God learn most of His will. Such are friends, not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth; and thus, as in the Old Testament to Abraham, the friend of God, and to Daniel, a man greatly beloved, so in the New Testament to the disciple who leaned on Jesus' bosom, are shown the things which God was about to do. "Mysteries are revealed unto the meek. The pure in heart shall see God. A pure heart penetrateth heaven and hell" (Thomas a-Kempis).<p>"More bounteous aspects on me beam,<p>Me mightier transports move and thrill;<p>So keep I fair through faith and prayer,<p>A virgin heart in work and will."--<span class= "ital">Sir Galahad.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Revelation of Jesus Christ</span>. This phrase occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 13</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>). It means the revelation which Jesus Christ makes, not that which reveals him. John is the <span class="accented">writer</span>, Jesus Christ the <span class="accented">Author</span>, of the book. Revelation (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is a word reserved for the gospel; no Old Testament prophecy is called a revelation (contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-30.htm">1 Samuel 20:30</a>). It means the <span class="accented">unveiling</span> of Divine mysteries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>), and from this it easily slips into meaning the mystery unveiled. Christ is both the Mystery and the Revealer of it. He comes to reveal himself, and in himself the Father, whose Image he is. Thus in its opening words the book takes us beyond itself. What is revealed is not secrets about the future, but a Person. And the Revealer is not man, but God; not John, but the Divine Son, commissioned by the Father. For even the unincarnate Word receives from the Father that which he reveals. <span class="cmt_word">Which God gave unto him</span>. This is remarkably in harmony with the Christology of the Fourth Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-20.htm">John 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-7.htm">John 17:7, 8</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). The simple infinitive to express a purpose after "give" is common to Gospel and Apocalypse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-52.htm">John 6:52</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His servants.</span> All Christians, not exclusively seers like St. John. "<span class="accented">Even</span> the things which" (Revised Version) makes "things which" in apposition with "the Revelation," which is probably right. <span class="cmt_word">Must</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>); because God has so decreed. This Divine "must" is frequent in the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-9.htm">John 20:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shortly</span>. The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> is much disputed. But, like "firstborn" in the question about the brethren of the Lord, "shortly" ought not to be pressed in determining the scope of the Apocalypse. Calling Jesus the <span class="accented">firstborn</span> Son of Mary tells us nothing as to her having other children. Saying that the Apocalypse shows things which must <span class="accented">shortly</span> come to pass tells us nothing as to its referring to events near St. John's own day. Probably it refers to them <span class="accented">and</span> to much else in the Christian dispensation. In the language of the seer, past, present, and future are interwoven together as seen by God, and more truth is contained than the seer himself knows. "The whole book ought to be received as a single word uttered in a single moment" (Bengel). It does not follow, because St. John had events near to his own day in his mind, that his words are limited to those events for us (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>:<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>; see Westcott, 'Historic Faith,' pp. 74, 75, and note on 1 John 2:18 in the 'Cambridge Bible for Schools'). <span class="cmt_word">Signified</span>. Jesus Christ signified, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> made known by symbol and figure, the things which must come to pass. "Signify" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is characteristic of St. John, to whom wonders are "signs" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of Divine truths. "This he said, <span class="accented">signifying</span> [by means of an allegory] by what manner of death he should die" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-33.htm">John 12:33</a>; comp. 18:32; 21:19). <span class="cmt_word">By his angel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">by means of his angel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). "Angel" here probably has its, common meaning of a spiritual messenger from the unseen world; but it is the fact of his being Christ's messenger, rather than his heavenly character, that is specially indicated. Whether one and the same angel is employed throughout the Revelation is not clear. He does not come into the foreground of the narrative until <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 7, 15</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1, 6, 9</a>). The Revelation is begun (vers. 17-20) and ended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>) by Christ himself; but the main portion is conducted "by means of his angel." Thus St. Paul says of the Law that it was "administered by means of angels in the hand of a mediator," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>). In this case the mediator is John, a "servant" specially selected for this work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-5.htm">Isaiah 49:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). Thus we have four gradations - the primary Agent, the Father; the secondary Agent, Jesus Christ; the instrument, his angel; the recipient, John. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 This book is the Revelation of Jesus Christ; the whole Bible is so; for all revelation comes through Christ, and all relates to him. Its principal subject is to discover the purposes of God concerning the affairs of the church, and of the nations as connected therewith, to the end of the world. These events would surely come to pass; and they would begin to come to pass very shortly. Though Christ is himself God, and has light and life in himself, yet, as Mediator between God and man, he receives instructions from the Father. To him we owe the knowledge of what we are to expect from God, and what he expects from us. The subject of this revelation was, the things that must shortly come to pass. On all who read or hear the words of the prophecy, a blessing is pronounced. Those are well employed who search the Bible. It is not enough that we read and hear, but we must keep the things that are written, in our memories, in our minds, in our affections, and in practice, and we shall be blessed in the deed. Even the mysteries and difficulties of this book are united with discoveries of God, suited to impress the mind with awe, and to purify the soul of the reader, though he may not discern the prophetic meaning. No part of Scripture more fully states the gospel, and warns against the evil of sin.</body></html>
