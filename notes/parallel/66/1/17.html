"Was this He whom upon earth St. John had known so familiarly? Was this He in whose bosom He had lain at that Last Supper, and said, 'Lord, which is he that betrayeth Thee?' When I saw Him thus transformed, thus glorified, I fell at His feet as one dead. Well might such be the effect, even upon the spirit of a just man made perfect--and St. John was still in the body--of such an open revelation of the risen glory of Christ" (Dr. Vaughan). It was pity, and the pang felt at the severity of retribution which overtook sin, which made Dante fall as a dead body falls (<span class= "ital">Inferno,</span> v.); it is the felt consciousness of unworthiness which seems to have overcome the Evangelist. This consciousness has its witness outside the Bible as well as in it. "Semele must perish if Jupiter reveals himself to her in his glory, being consumed in the brightness of that glory." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>, "Thou canst not see My face; for there shall no man see Me and live.") For every man it is a dreadful thing to stand face to face with God. Yet the consciousness of this unworthiness to behold God, or to receive a near revelation of His presence, is a sign of faith, and is welcomed as such. Of him who said, "Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof," Christ said, "I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-8.htm" title="The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.">Matthew 8:8-10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not.</span>--The words "unto me" should be omitted. The gesture is designed to give the assurance of comfort; the hand which was raised up to bless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.">Luke 24:51</a>), which was reached forth to heal the leper, to raise the sinking Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-31.htm" title="And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?">Matthew 14:31</a>), and to touch the wounded ear of Malchus, is now stretched out to reassure His servant; and the words, like those which John had heard upon the Mount of Transfiguration, and when toiling against the waves of Galilee, bid him not to be afraid. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-10.htm" title="And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.">Daniel 10:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I am the first and the last</span>.--The "last" must not be taken here to mean the least and lowest, as though it referred to our Lord's humiliation; the last points forwards, as the <span class= "ital">first</span> points backwards. He was before all things, and so the <span class= "ital">first;</span> and though all things change, folded up as a vesture, yet His years shall not fail, and so He is the <span class= "ital">last. "</span>The <span class= "ital">first</span> because all things are from Me; the last because to Me are all things" (Richard of St. Victor). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-11.htm" title="They shall perish; but you remain; and they all shall wax old as does a garment;">Hebrews 1:11-12</a>.) This pre-eminence of first and last is thrice claimed for the Lord Jehovah in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm" title="Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.">Isaiah 41:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-12.htm" title="Listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.">Isaiah 48:12</a>), and thrice for the Lord Jesus in this book (in this passage, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-8.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things said the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;">Revelation 2:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.">Revelation 22:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I fell at his feet as dead</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as one dead - as a dead man.</span> St. Peter had fallen at Jesus' feet when he became conscious of the ineffable difference between sinlessness and sinfulness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>). How much more, therefore, would consciousness of the glorified Christ overwhelm St. John! Long years of contemplation of the incarnate Son would not prevent that. In like manner, Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>), Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17, 27</a>), and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>) are affected by the Divine presence. <span class="cmt_word">Fear not</span>. Thus Christ encouraged the terrified apostles on the lake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-20.htm">John 6:20</a>) and at the Transfiguration. So also the angel cheered Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>), Zacharias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>), Mary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>), the shepherds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>), and the women at the sepulchre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The churches receive their light from Christ and the gospel, and hold it forth to others. They are golden candlesticks; they should be precious and pure; not only the ministers, but the members of the churches; their light should so shine before men, as to engage others to give glory to God. And the apostle saw as though of the Lord Jesus Christ appeared in the midst of the golden candlesticks. He is with his churches always, to the end of the world, filling them with light, and life, and love. He was clothed with a robe down to the feet, perhaps representing his righteousness and priesthood, as Mediator. This vest was girt with a golden girdle, which may denote how precious are his love and affection for his people. His head and hairs white like wool and as snow, may signify his majesty, purity, and eternity. His eyes as a flame of fire, may represent his knowledge of the secrets of all hearts, and of the most distant events. His feet like fine brass burning in a furnace, may denote the firmness of his appointments, and the excellence of his proceedings. His voice as the sound of many waters, may represent the power of his word, to remove or to destroy. The seven stars were emblems of the ministers of the seven churches to which the apostle was ordered to write, and whom Christ upheld and directed. The sword represented his justice, and his word, piercing to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, Heb 4:12. His countenance was like the sun, when it shines clearly and powerfully; its strength too bright and dazzling for mortal eyes to behold. The apostle was overpowered with the greatness of the lustre and glory in which Christ appeared. We may well be contented to walk by faith, while here upon earth. The Lord Jesus spake words of comfort; Fear not. Words of instruction; telling who thus appeared. And his Divine nature; the First and the Last. His former sufferings; I was dead: the very same whom his disciples saw upon the cross. His resurrection and life; I have conquered death, and am partaker of endless life. His office and authority; sovereign dominion in and over the invisible world, as the Judge of all, from whose sentence there is no appeal. Let us listen to the voice of Christ, and receive the tokens of his love, for what can he withhold from those for whose sins he has died? May we then obey his word, and give up ourselves wholly to him who directs all things aright.</body></html>
