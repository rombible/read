Wordsworth renders, "No delay, save only in the days," etc., and believes that the passage points to a brief respite, during which men may yet repent. <span class="cmt_word">When he shall begin to sound</span>; <span class="accented">when he is about to sound</span> [his trumpet]. Alford points out the propriety of the expression. "When the seventh angel does sound, the completed time of the fulfilment is simultaneous with his blowing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>), so that it is properly said that the fulfilment comes in the days when he is about to blow." <span class="cmt_word">The mystery of God should be finished;</span> <span class="accented">also</span> (or <span class="accented">then</span>, as Revised Version) <span class="accented">the mystery of God was fulfilled.</span> "The prophetic past" (Wordsworth). "The mystery of God" is all that man does not now understand in connection with God's dealings with man, but of the existence of which he is cognizant, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the existence of evil in the world, and God's modes of dealing with that and all mankind, which we only know in part. God's plans are being steadily and surely worked out, though we are not able to comprehend them. <span class="cmt_word">As he hath declared to his servants the prophets</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as he evangelized his servants the prophets</span>; <span class="accented">or</span>, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets.</span> Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets." The promise of the complete fulfilment of the mystery of God is good news indeed for the fainting Christian, for it tells of the end of his trials and the overthrow of his enemies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 The apostle saw another representation. The person communicating this discovery probably was our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, or it was to show his glory. He veils his glory, which is too great for mortal eyes to behold; and throws a veil upon his dispensations. A rainbow was upon his head; our Lord is always mindful of his covenant. His awful voice was echoed by seven thunders; solemn and terrible ways of discovering the mind of God. We know not the subjects of the seven thunders, nor the reasons for suppressing them. There are great events in history, perhaps relating to the Christian church, which are not noticed in open prophecy. The final salvation of the righteous, and the final success of true religion on earth, are engaged for by the unfailing word of the Lord. Though the time may not be yet, it cannot be far distant. Very soon, as to us, time will be no more; but if we are believers, a happy eternity will follow: we shall from heaven behold and rejoice in the triumphs of Christ, and his cause on earth.</body></html>
