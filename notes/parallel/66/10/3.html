Thus we have four sets of sevens. It was not a seven-fold peal of thunder, but seven thunders, which spake forth distinctly their own voices. This marked language brings the seven thunders, though their utterances are never revealed, into prominence as a portion of the Apocalyptic system. But what were these thunders? Were they more terrible judgments still? and did the sealing of them signify the shortening of the days of judgment, as Christ had said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm" title="And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.">Matthew 24:22</a>)? It may be so. One thing seems certain--the guesses which have been hazarded (such as that they are identical with the trumpets; that they are the seven crusades) can hardly be admitted. Whatever they were, they were perfectly intelligible to the Evangelist. He was on the point of writing down their utterances. Will this fact help us to understand the general object of their introduction here?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth;</span> <span class="accented">and be cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth</span> (Revised Version). What the angel <span class="accented">cried we</span> are apparently not told. Probably the whole incident is intended merely to set forth the powerful and terrible nature of the messenger who is to deliver God's message. The figure is a very common one with the prophetical writers (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices;</span> <span class="accented">and when he cried, the seven</span>, etc. (Revised Version). This, again, is a repetition of the idea contained in the preceding clause. The Jews were accustomed to call thunder the seven voices, and to regard it as the voice of the Lord (cf. the repetition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>.), in the same way that they regarded lightning as the fire of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>). We have, therefore, most probably, a national idea of the Jews, made use of to express the simple fact of the loud and mighty character of the utterance of the angel (cf. the note on <span class="accented">Euphrates</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-14.htm">Revelation 9:14</a>). If this be so, it is unnecessary to seek for any more subtle interpretation of <span class="accented">the seven thunders</span>, as that they represent the seven crusades (Vitringa), etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 The apostle saw another representation. The person communicating this discovery probably was our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, or it was to show his glory. He veils his glory, which is too great for mortal eyes to behold; and throws a veil upon his dispensations. A rainbow was upon his head; our Lord is always mindful of his covenant. His awful voice was echoed by seven thunders; solemn and terrible ways of discovering the mind of God. We know not the subjects of the seven thunders, nor the reasons for suppressing them. There are great events in history, perhaps relating to the Christian church, which are not noticed in open prophecy. The final salvation of the righteous, and the final success of true religion on earth, are engaged for by the unfailing word of the Lord. Though the time may not be yet, it cannot be far distant. Very soon, as to us, time will be no more; but if we are believers, a happy eternity will follow: we shall from heaven behold and rejoice in the triumphs of Christ, and his cause on earth.</body></html>
