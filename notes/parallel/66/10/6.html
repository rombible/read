Who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein. Though the balance of authority is in favour of the last clause, yet it is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;</span>, A, and some cursives (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). These two characteristics of God - his eternity and his omnipotence - are referred to in order to demonstrate the certainty of the fulfilment of the prophecy which follows. That there should be time no longer (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">that time no longer shall be.</span> This may be rendered: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Time (a finite terminable period, as opposed to eternity) shall no longer exist, but eternity shall be entered upon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There shall be no more time, in the sense of "there shall be no longer any delay" in the infliction of the last judgment, set forth under the seventh trumpet. The solution seems to be that both meanings are implied. There seems to be a reference to the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>, to the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, during which the saints were to rest and await the infliction of God's wrath upon the ungodly. The visions of the first six trumpets have shown how, in the period of the world's existence, the ungodly do not escape judicial retribution. But that is not all; the force of the six judgments not having served to reduce the worldly to repentance, there can be no more delay, the last final judgment follows. But the last judgment, which follows quickly upon the other six (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-14.htm">Revelation 11:14</a>), is for eternity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>). The advent of this woe is, therefore, simultaneous with the end of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="accented">"time,"</span> by which we signify that definite period, cut out of eternity, as it were, which is coeval with the existence of the world, and ceases with its destruction. The expression, therefore, implies, "The measure of God's punishments, viewed as opportunities for repentance, is exhausted; there is a limit to his endurance; the allotted time having been run, and his mercy to a large extent having been spurned, there is no more delay;" then falls the last final blow, which is at the end of "time," and at the beginning (for many) of eternity. Ebrard renders, "A space of time in which to repent" - a meaning compatible with the explanation given above. Others render, "The time of the fulfilment shall not be yet, but it shall be when the seventh trumpet sounds;" but this interpretation makes <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> equal <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Others, again, have made <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">a chronus</span>, equal a definite number of years, and have endeavoured to compute the exact equivalent of the period (see Bengel, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 The apostle saw another representation. The person communicating this discovery probably was our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, or it was to show his glory. He veils his glory, which is too great for mortal eyes to behold; and throws a veil upon his dispensations. A rainbow was upon his head; our Lord is always mindful of his covenant. His awful voice was echoed by seven thunders; solemn and terrible ways of discovering the mind of God. We know not the subjects of the seven thunders, nor the reasons for suppressing them. There are great events in history, perhaps relating to the Christian church, which are not noticed in open prophecy. The final salvation of the righteous, and the final success of true religion on earth, are engaged for by the unfailing word of the Lord. Though the time may not be yet, it cannot be far distant. Very soon, as to us, time will be no more; but if we are believers, a happy eternity will follow: we shall from heaven behold and rejoice in the triumphs of Christ, and his cause on earth.</body></html>
