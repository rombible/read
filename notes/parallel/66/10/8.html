And I went away to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he saith to me, Take and eat it up; and it shall make bitter thy belly, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey</span>. The image of eating the roll is derived from the Old Testament. We meet with it in Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/3-1.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-16.htm" title="Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.">Jeremiah 15:16</a>). The passage in Ezekiel is probably the basis of the present passage, and the chapter in which it occurs gives us the meaning of the symbol: the eating of the roll, or the words of the roll, is the complete mastering of the contents of the book--the digesting, as we say, its meaning, till the principles and truths are thoroughly familiar and loved. "All my words" (so runs the explanatory verse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-10.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.">Ezekiel 3:10</a>) "that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears." It is similar to the Psalmist's practice: "Thy words have I hid within my heart;" he made himself so familiar with them that they were no longer a code of laws, but a constant instinct, a second nature to him. Thus preeminently should he be familiar with his Master's words and heart, saturated with his Master's principles, who is to be a witness and a prophet for his Lord. "He who would carry God's words to another must first be impressed and penetrated with them himself. He must not only hear, read, mark, and learn, but also (according to the Scriptural figure) inwardly digest them."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said</span>; and <span class="accented">the voice which I heard out of heaven</span>, [I heard] <span class="accented">again talking with me and saying.</span> The construction is irregular." The voice, viz. that mentioned in ver. 4, which is probably that of Christ himself (see on ver. 4).

(On the signification of the "little book," see on ver. 2; and also for the meaning of the last clause, see the same place.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:8-11 Most men feel pleasure in looking into future events, and all good men like to receive a word from God. But when this book of prophecy was thoroughly digested by the apostle, the contents would be bitter; there were things so awful and terrible, such grievous persecutions of the people of God, such desolations in the earth, that the foresight and foreknowledge of them would be painful to his mind. Let us seek to be taught by Christ, and to obey his orders; daily meditating on his word, that it may nourish our souls; and then declaring it according to our several stations. The sweetness of such contemplations will often be mingled with bitterness, while we compare the Scriptures with the state of the world and the church, or even with that of our own hearts.</body></html>
