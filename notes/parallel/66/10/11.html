This carries us on to the vision in the next chapter, where the two witnesses stand so solitary, and prophesy so mightily, yet so vainly, among men. He will have to tell the story of churches and peoples, priests and princes, unmindful of their high calling and their allegiance to their true king, and of their hatred of God's mightiest and purest witnesses. The end, indeed, will come. The Church will be victorious. The kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of Christ: but it will be through persecutions, apostasies, judgments. This is the sad vision he must describe. The interposed visions will answer the question, "What has the Church been doing?" but it will show how she has done that work, distressed by heresies, crippled by worldliness, trodden down by enemies, and, worse than enemies, foes veiled as friends. But this very vision will lead to the unfolding of the more truly spiritual aspects of the Church's work, and of that conflict in which she contends with the multiform spirit and power of evil. Thus will he prophesy of peoples and kings many.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f72;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "they say," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, and thirty cursives, and is adopted in the Revised Version. <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "he saith," is found in P and seventeen cursives. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> leaves the speakers quite indefinite, amounting, in fact, to no more than" it was said" (Alford); cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>. 13. Thou must prophesy again. <span class="accented">Thou retest</span>, because it is laid upon thee by God's command. It is to be done <span class="accented">again</span>, because the seer has already to some extent set forth God's will in the earlier part of the book; and he is now required to proceed with the delivery of his message. "Prophesy" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a>) has rather its literal than its derived meaning. It is the telling forth of God's purposes, and may refer to past as well as present or future events. The sentence refers to the announcements made in the following part of the Apocalypse (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). Bede and others take it to mean the Gospel of St. John, which was, perhaps, afterwards composed (see Introduction). Victorinus thinks it points to the period of St. John's return from Patmos to Ephesus, where the Apocalypse may have been published. <span class="cmt_word">Before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings;</span> <span class="accented">concerning many peoples</span>, etc. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, with dative). These are the objects of the prophecy, not the audience. This serves to explain the reference in the preceding sentence. The message is not delivered <span class="accented">to</span>, but <span class="accented">about</span> peoples, etc. The fourfold enumeration seems to point to the breadth of the signification - it embraces the whole of mankind (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>). This is the end of what is called by many writers the first episode; the second follows. The incident is often alluded to as the "new commission" of St. John; but it seems less a new commission than a solemn re-enactment of the command delivered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:8-11 Most men feel pleasure in looking into future events, and all good men like to receive a word from God. But when this book of prophecy was thoroughly digested by the apostle, the contents would be bitter; there were things so awful and terrible, such grievous persecutions of the people of God, such desolations in the earth, that the foresight and foreknowledge of them would be painful to his mind. Let us seek to be taught by Christ, and to obey his orders; daily meditating on his word, that it may nourish our souls; and then declaring it according to our several stations. The sweetness of such contemplations will often be mingled with bitterness, while we compare the Scriptures with the state of the world and the church, or even with that of our own hearts.</body></html>
