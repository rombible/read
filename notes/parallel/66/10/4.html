It was no mere thunder-like sound he heard: the thunders spoke; and he would have continued his writing as he had been commanded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm" title="Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.">Revelation 1:11</a>) had not the voice out of heaven forbidden him. The utterances, then, are for those who hear them; they are not to be made generally known. Is it not the solemn, sacred, divine voice not to be known by all, but by those who have ears to hear when "the God of glory thundereth?" "Lo ! He doth send forth His voice, yea, and that a mighty voice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-33.htm" title="To him that rides on the heavens of heavens, which were of old; see, he does send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.">Psalm 68:33</a>). Mankind may hear the thunder; only those whose ears God has opened can hear the utterances and the inspiriting messages which they bring. So was it once in our Lord's life. The people said it thundered; some thought an angel spake; but there were articulate words which He who came to do God's will, in whose heart was God's law, heard, and to Him that thunderlike voice promised to "glorify His name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28-29</a>). Similarly here, the Evangelist (who is in this but a type of the true witnesses for God), who is to prophecy before peoples and kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.">Revelation 10:11</a>), hears words spoken by the divine voice which make him strong for his mission. It is so evermore. Dull ears there are who hear thunder, but never God's voice; dim eyes there are which see no trace of the divine craftsman in all nature, though<p>"Earth's crammed with God,<p>And every common bush aglow with Him."<p>The thunders are not to be written down; they are for those who have ears to hear.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write;</span> <span class="accented">and when the seven thunders spoke, I was</span>, etc. It seems that St. John, in his vision, thought himself to be writing down the incidents as they were displayed before him. This he supposed himself to be doing in obedience to the command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11, 19</a>. He accordingly is proceeding to do so here, when he is stopped by the angel. <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me.</span> Omit "unto me," with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, all the versions, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius, etc. Throughout the Apocalypse we find frequent mention of <span class="accented">a voice</span>, without any definite statement as to the possessor. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11, 12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5, 15</a>, the <span class="accented">voice</span> appears to be that of Christ or God the Father. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a> it may be that of Christ or an angel; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a> it seems to be the angel's voice; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a> it apparently proceeds from the four living beings; while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-13.htm">Revelation 9:13</a>, although the command appears to be the command of God, the locality from which the voice issues appears to bear reference to the souls of the saints, and their cry for vengeance. Here it seems best to identify the "voice from heaven" with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>, where it is probably Christ himself (see on Revelation 1:10). <span class="cmt_word">Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, "But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-10.htm">Revelation 22:10</a>, "And he saith unto me. Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand"). As stated in the note on ver. 2, not all God's purposes are revealed. Here we have a positive indication that some truths are withheld. It is useless to speculate on the nature of that which is purposely concealed from us. The probable conclusions which we may deduce are well put by Alford: "From the very character of thunder, that the utterances were of fearful import; from the place which they hold, that they relate to the Church; from the command to conceal them, first, encouragement, that God in his tender mercy to his own does not reveal all his terrors; secondly, godly fear, seeing that the arrows of his quiver are not exhausted, but besides things expressly foretold, there are more behind not revealed to us." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 The apostle saw another representation. The person communicating this discovery probably was our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, or it was to show his glory. He veils his glory, which is too great for mortal eyes to behold; and throws a veil upon his dispensations. A rainbow was upon his head; our Lord is always mindful of his covenant. His awful voice was echoed by seven thunders; solemn and terrible ways of discovering the mind of God. We know not the subjects of the seven thunders, nor the reasons for suppressing them. There are great events in history, perhaps relating to the Christian church, which are not noticed in open prophecy. The final salvation of the righteous, and the final success of true religion on earth, are engaged for by the unfailing word of the Lord. Though the time may not be yet, it cannot be far distant. Very soon, as to us, time will be no more; but if we are believers, a happy eternity will follow: we shall from heaven behold and rejoice in the triumphs of Christ, and his cause on earth.</body></html>
