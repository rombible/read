But he is probably, in his vision, already on the earth (see on ver. 1). And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; <span class="accented">he saith.</span> This part of the vision is founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-3:3</a>. The act is no doubt intended to convey the idea that the seer is to carefully receive, to digest thoroughly, as it were, his message in order to deriver it faithfully. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-10.htm">Ezekiel 3:10</a> the prophet is told, "All my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them," etc. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey;</span> cf. the vision of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>-3, where the sweetness only is immediately mentioned; but the bitterness is implied later on in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>. The sweetness expresses the pleasure and readiness with which St. John receives his commission; the bitterness symbolizes the grief which possesses him when he thoroughly takes in the nature of his message. The pleasure with which he receives the angel's commands may proceed from joy at the thought that the final overthrow of the wicked is the final deliverance of the saints; or it may be that he feels himself honoured at being chosen as the medium for conveying God's message. Compare the readiness of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a> to fulfil a similar office, and his subsequent fear and hesitation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>). The bitterness of the seer follows when he realizes the terrible nature of the judgment he is to announce (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a>, "For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt"). Various other explanations, more or less allegorical, have been suggested. Thus Andreas explains that the first sweetness of sin is afterwards converted into bitterness. Origen, quoted in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' "Very sweet is this the book of Scripture when first perceived, but bitter to the conscience within." Maurice supposes that St. John's joy proceeds from the expectation that the book will announce the fall of the great Babel empire of the world, and his disappointment follows when he discovers that it predicts the fall of Jerusalem. Bede explains that the bitterness in the belly indicates the reception by the seer, but the sweetness in the mouth is the declaration to others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:8-11 Most men feel pleasure in looking into future events, and all good men like to receive a word from God. But when this book of prophecy was thoroughly digested by the apostle, the contents would be bitter; there were things so awful and terrible, such grievous persecutions of the people of God, such desolations in the earth, that the foresight and foreknowledge of them would be painful to his mind. Let us seek to be taught by Christ, and to obey his orders; daily meditating on his word, that it may nourish our souls; and then declaring it according to our several stations. The sweetness of such contemplations will often be mingled with bitterness, while we compare the Scriptures with the state of the world and the church, or even with that of our own hearts.</body></html>
