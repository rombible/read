Again we have the white horse, and the rider. That early vision of a conquering Christ had been first a hope and then a despair, as age after age interposed its obstacles to the manifestation of the sons of God; but now, with added splendour, the vision is renewed: the hopes of the waiting shall not perish for ever. Once more the victorious rider appears, and His name dispels all fear, though the vision has been long in tarrying. At the end it speaks and does not tarry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/habakkuk/2-1.htm" title="I will stand on my watch, and set me on the tower, and will watch to see what he will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.">Habakkuk 2:1-4</a>), for He who rides upon the heavens, as it were upon a horse, has His name Faithful and True (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm" title="Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)">Hebrews 10:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-36.htm" title="For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.">Hebrews 10:36-38</a>). This name combines two characteristics: fidelity to promises, trustworthiness; and the power to satisfy every legitimate desire which has been awakened in the hearts of His people; for in Him all hopes find repose, and every ideal is realised. He is further pictured as a warrior. This warrior bridegroom carries us back to Psalms 45, where a similar combination of marriage joy and martial triumph is found. Righteousness marks His progress in war, as faithfulness is manifested towards those who trust Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4-5</a>). Here is comfort on the threshold of a vision of deliverance. The book has shown us war, conflict, confusion: the passions of men surging against one another, and dashing like vain waves against God's immutable laws; the world history is written in blood. We blame men for these cruel and desolating wars; but another question rises imperiously, Why does an all-good ruler allow these heart-breaking scenes? If earth's groans pain and trouble us, do they not grieve Him? Where is He that He permits all this? The answer is, "In righteousness He judges and makes war." The worked-out history of the world will make this plain. The righteousness of God is being revealed: all will see it one day; but now the just must live by faith in Him who is faithful and true, and who preserves the germ of all divine life in the history of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse.</span> A new vision now opens, which is, however, part of the preceding series, commencing at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>. The destruction of certain forms of evil - typified by Babylon and the harlot - has been declared; the final overthrow of the dragon has vet to be related, though there may be no such separation in the actual infliction of these punishments as there necessarily is in the relation of them. The warfare now to be described must be understood to be that which is taking place between the hosts of Christ and Satan throughout the period of the world's existence. <span class="accented">The heaven opened</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>). A similar figure has been already employed in the first seal vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>). It has been pointed out that the same image is employed at the beginning and at the end of the description of the warfare between Christ and the devil. He who is the First and the Last, the Alpha and Omega (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>), rides forth conquering and to conquer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</span> Even the participial construction here employed connects this account with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>. "Faithful and True" are the titles applied to our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>, which see. <span class="accented">In righteousness he cloth judge</span>; cf. Isaiah's prophecy of Christ: "But with righteousness shall he judge the poor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>); cf. ver. 2 of this chapter. The purposes of this expedition are "to judge and make war." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:11-21 Christ, the glorious Head of the church, is described as on a white horse, the emblem of justice and holiness. He has many crowns, for he is King of kings, and Lord of lords. He is arrayed in a vesture dipped in his own blood, by which he purchased his power as Mediator; and in the blood of his enemies, over whom he always prevails. His name is The Word of God; a name none fully knows but himself; only this we know, that this Word was God manifest in the flesh; but his perfections cannot be fully understood by any creature. Angels and saints follow, and are like Christ in their armour of purity and righteousness. The threatenings of the written word he is going to execute on his enemies. The ensigns of his authority are his name; asserting his authority and power, warning the most powerful princes to submit, or they must fall before him. The powers of earth and hell make their utmost effort. These verses declare important events, foretold by the prophets. These persons were not excused because they did what their leaders bade them. How vain will be the plea of many sinners at the great day! We followed our guides; we did as we saw others do! God has given a rule to walk by, in his word; neither the example of the most, nor of the chief, must influence us contrary thereto: if we do as the most do, we must go where the most go, even into the burning lake.</body></html>
