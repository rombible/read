Probably the similarity of this passage has caused the reading, "sprinkled with blood," which is found in a few manuscripts. In the original passage in Isaiah, the <span class="accented">blood</span> is doubtless the <span class="accented">blood</span> of his enemies; but it is possible that there is here a reference to the blood of Christ himself, which he shed in his warfare with Satan. <span class="cmt_word">And his Name is called The Word of God.</span> Only in St. John's writings does this title appear - a strong argument in favour of his authorship of the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>). This cannot be the "name" of ver. 12, which, as there explained, is unknown. This <span class="accented">Name</span>, the <span class="accented">Word of God</span>, is appropriately used when he is going forth to judgment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:11-21 Christ, the glorious Head of the church, is described as on a white horse, the emblem of justice and holiness. He has many crowns, for he is King of kings, and Lord of lords. He is arrayed in a vesture dipped in his own blood, by which he purchased his power as Mediator; and in the blood of his enemies, over whom he always prevails. His name is The Word of God; a name none fully knows but himself; only this we know, that this Word was God manifest in the flesh; but his perfections cannot be fully understood by any creature. Angels and saints follow, and are like Christ in their armour of purity and righteousness. The threatenings of the written word he is going to execute on his enemies. The ensigns of his authority are his name; asserting his authority and power, warning the most powerful princes to submit, or they must fall before him. The powers of earth and hell make their utmost effort. These verses declare important events, foretold by the prophets. These persons were not excused because they did what their leaders bade them. How vain will be the plea of many sinners at the great day! We followed our guides; we did as we saw others do! God has given a rule to walk by, in his word; neither the example of the most, nor of the chief, must influence us contrary thereto: if we do as the most do, we must go where the most go, even into the burning lake.</body></html>
