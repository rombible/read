We are not told whose voice it is. Some have assumed that it is Christ's: it is better to leave it indefinite. In response to the bidding, the voice of praise is heard (like the voice spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-2.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:">Revelation 14:2</a>), as it were, the voice of a great multitude; and, as it were, the voice of many waters; and, as it were, the voice of mighty thunders. All nature's tones seem mingled in this voice of praise: it is human, it is majestic as the sea, and glorious as the thunder.<p>The Anthem.<p>Alleluia!<p>For the Lord reigned,<p>The God, the Almighty.<p>Let us rejoice and exult,<p>And we will give the glory to Him,<p>Because the marriage of the Lamb is come,<p>And His wife hath made herself ready.<p>In this anthem the word for "reigneth" is not in the present tense, as in the English version; but, though it is translated here "reigned," we must not understand it of the past only: it expresses the exultation of the servants of God that the Kingship of their God is manifested, and vindicated against those who denied, or hated His rule. His reign never ceased; and He has showed that His was a real sovereignty. Their joy rises also from the prospect of the nearer union between the Lamb and His Bride. This close union is more fully spoken of later: here the glorious close is for a moment anticipated: the morning glow announces the coming day: it is near even at the doors. The image of the marriage is familiar. It entered into our Lord's parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-2.htm" title="The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,">Matthew 22:2-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1-10</a>): we catch it in the Psalms and in the Epistles (Psalms 45, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2Corinthians 11:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a voice came out of the throne, saying.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;</span> "out of," is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, P, 1, 34, etc.; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>, "forth from," is supported by A, B, C, etc.; while B reads <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "heaven," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "throne." Alford suggests that the direction rather than the source of the voice is intended. It is impossible to say to whom the voice should be attributed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4, 8</a>, etc.). As an invitation to the Church to praise God, we might expect the voice to be that of one of the elders. <span class="cmt_word">Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, P, omit the first "and," thus reading: "ye his servants, ye that fear him," etc. The first words are a repetition of the "Hallelujah" of ver. 1. The following phrases are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-13.htm">Psalm 115:13</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Praising God for what we have, is praying for what is yet further to be done for us. There is harmony between the angels and the saints in this triumphant song. Christ is the Bridegroom of his ransomed church. This second union will be completed in heaven; but the beginning of the glorious millennium (by which is meant a reign of Christ, or a state of happiness, for a thousand years on earth) may be considered as the celebration of his espousals on earth. Then the church of Christ, being purified from errors, divisions, and corruptions, in doctrine, discipline, worship, and practice, will be made ready to be publicly owned by him as his delight and his beloved. The church appeared; not in the gay, gaudy dress of the mother of harlots, but in fine linen, clean and white. In the robes of Christ's righteousness, imputed for justification, and imparted for sanctification. The promises of the gospel, the true sayings of God, opened, applied, and sealed by the Spirit of God, in holy ordinances, are the marriage-feast. This seems to refer to the abundant grace and consolation Christians will receive in the happy days which are to come. The apostle offered honour to the angel. The angel refused it. He directed the apostle to the true and only object of religious worship; to worship God, and him alone. This plainly condemns the practice of those who worship the elements of bread and wine, and saints, and angels; and of those who do not believe that Christ is truly and by nature God, yet pay him a sort of worship. They stand convicted of idolatry by a messenger from heaven. These are the true sayings of God; of Him who is to be worshipped, as one with the Father and the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
