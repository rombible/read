This is somewhat anticipatory; the full vision of the bride of the Lamb is reserved until <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. But the rejoicing over Babylon and the harlot naturally suggests the allusion to Christ's faithful Church, just as the vision of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. is suggested by the concluding words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>. "The marriage of the Lamb" is the figure under which is depicted that complete union between Christ and his faithful Church, which will be consummated at the last day, when Satan has been overcome and sin destroyed. It stands in contrast with the fornication of the harlot - the union of the spiritually unfaithful portion of Christ's Church with the powers of the world (see on Revelation 17:1, 2). Alford remarks, "This figure, of a marriage between the Lord and his people, is too frequent and familiar to need explanation (cf. in the Old Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19</a>, etc.; and in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>, etc.)." This symbol of the <span class="accented">wife</span> or <span class="accented">bride</span> indicates the redeemed, who have already in several places been alluded to in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>, "they that are with him"). The saints have made themselves <span class="accented">ready</span> by enduing themselves with the robe of righteousness (ver. 8). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Praising God for what we have, is praying for what is yet further to be done for us. There is harmony between the angels and the saints in this triumphant song. Christ is the Bridegroom of his ransomed church. This second union will be completed in heaven; but the beginning of the glorious millennium (by which is meant a reign of Christ, or a state of happiness, for a thousand years on earth) may be considered as the celebration of his espousals on earth. Then the church of Christ, being purified from errors, divisions, and corruptions, in doctrine, discipline, worship, and practice, will be made ready to be publicly owned by him as his delight and his beloved. The church appeared; not in the gay, gaudy dress of the mother of harlots, but in fine linen, clean and white. In the robes of Christ's righteousness, imputed for justification, and imparted for sanctification. The promises of the gospel, the true sayings of God, opened, applied, and sealed by the Spirit of God, in holy ordinances, are the marriage-feast. This seems to refer to the abundant grace and consolation Christians will receive in the happy days which are to come. The apostle offered honour to the angel. The angel refused it. He directed the apostle to the true and only object of religious worship; to worship God, and him alone. This plainly condemns the practice of those who worship the elements of bread and wine, and saints, and angels; and of those who do not believe that Christ is truly and by nature God, yet pay him a sort of worship. They stand convicted of idolatry by a messenger from heaven. These are the true sayings of God; of Him who is to be worshipped, as one with the Father and the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
