The song is as follows:--<p>Alleluia!<p>The salvation, and the glory, and the power<p>Are our God's,<p>Because true and righteous are His judgments,<p>Because He judged the great harlot, who corrupted the<p>earth in her fornication,<p>And avenged the blood of His servants out of her hand,<p>Alleluia.<p>This last "Alleluia" clearly belongs to the song or chorus. It is separated from the body of it by the descriptive words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-3.htm" title="And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.">Revelation 19:3</a>), <span class= "ital">And again they said, Alleluia;</span> or better, <span class= "ital">and a second time they have said.</span> The Evangelist, as he writes, seems to hear once more the strains of the anthem: he writes down the words. and, as the final "Alleluia" bursts forth after a musical pause, he writes, "once more they have said Alleluia." The word Alleluia occurs in this passage no less than four times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:">Revelation 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-3.htm" title="And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.">Revelation 19:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-6.htm" title="And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns.">Revelation 19:6</a>): it is nowhere else used in the New Testament; but it is familiar to us in the Psalms, as fifteen of them begin or end with "Praise ye the Lord," or "Hallelujah;" and the genius of Handel has enshrined the word in imperishable music. The song here does not begin with ascribing "salvation, &c.," to God, as the English version suggests: it rather affirms the fact: the salvation, &c., is God's. It is the echo of the ancient utterance--"Salvation belongeth unto God." It is the triumphant affirmation of the truth by which the Church and children of God had sustained their struggling petitions, as they closed the prayer which Christ Himself had taught them, saying, when too often it seemed to be otherwise, "Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory." So here they give a threefold praise: the salvation, and the glory, and the power are all God's. The manifestation of His power is in the deliverance of His children from the evil, from the great harlot, and in the avenging the blood of His servants out of her hand, "forcing, as it were, out of her hand the price of their blood."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying;</span> <span class="accented">after these things I heard, as it were, a great voice of a great multitude</span>, etc. The usual introduction to a new phase of a vision (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>, etc.). The "great voice," as usual, characteristic of the heavenly utterances (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-2.htm">Revelation 5:2</a>, etc.). Again, we are not told whose the utterance is. It may well be that of all the heavenly inhabitants and saints in glory (cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). As usual in the Apocalypse, at the termination of a description of the last judgment comes the triumphant song of the heavenly host (cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>). Thus the account of the conflict between God and the devil, which was begun at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>, is here concluded at ver. 8; after which the narrative takes a fresh departure, once more returning, as it were, to the beginning, and tracing anew this warfare. The remaining portion of the book is analogous to the latter part of Ezekiel. <span class="cmt_word">Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God;</span> <span class="accented">Hallelujah</span>; <span class="accented">the salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God.</span> <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, "the honour," found in several cursives, is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, etc. So also with the word "Lord." <span class="accented">Hallelujah - "</span>Praise ye Jehovah" - is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-1.htm">Psalm 135:1</a> and elsewhere. It is translated in ver. 5 of this chapter, as is St. John's custom (see on Revelation 9:11). It has been remarked that the word "Hallelujah" is chiefly used in connection with the punishment of the wicked; in which manner it is also used here. (For a similar ascription of praise, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, etc.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Praising God for what we have, is praying for what is yet further to be done for us. There is harmony between the angels and the saints in this triumphant song. Christ is the Bridegroom of his ransomed church. This second union will be completed in heaven; but the beginning of the glorious millennium (by which is meant a reign of Christ, or a state of happiness, for a thousand years on earth) may be considered as the celebration of his espousals on earth. Then the church of Christ, being purified from errors, divisions, and corruptions, in doctrine, discipline, worship, and practice, will be made ready to be publicly owned by him as his delight and his beloved. The church appeared; not in the gay, gaudy dress of the mother of harlots, but in fine linen, clean and white. In the robes of Christ's righteousness, imputed for justification, and imparted for sanctification. The promises of the gospel, the true sayings of God, opened, applied, and sealed by the Spirit of God, in holy ordinances, are the marriage-feast. This seems to refer to the abundant grace and consolation Christians will receive in the happy days which are to come. The apostle offered honour to the angel. The angel refused it. He directed the apostle to the true and only object of religious worship; to worship God, and him alone. This plainly condemns the practice of those who worship the elements of bread and wine, and saints, and angels; and of those who do not believe that Christ is truly and by nature God, yet pay him a sort of worship. They stand convicted of idolatry by a messenger from heaven. These are the true sayings of God; of Him who is to be worshipped, as one with the Father and the Holy Spirit.</body></html>
