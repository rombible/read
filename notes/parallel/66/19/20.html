Here we have described the destruction of the earthly manifestations of Satan's power; the means by which he seeks to achieve his purposes, and which we have interpreted as the hostile world power and self deception (see on Revelation 13.). The whole account contained in vers. 11-21 is a brief recapitulation of the whole period of warfare between Christ and Satan, with special attention given to the final overthrow of the powers of evil. It, therefore, covers the same ground as the vision of seals, and then that of the trumpets, then that of the vials, and afterwards that of the beasts, each occupies. The chief difference is that in all those visions the everyday conflict is more particularly described; whereas in this passage the termination of the conflict is specially brought before us. The same ground is covered in the next chapter, advancing, however, one step further, and showing us the final punishment of Satan himself, as well as of his instruments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone;</span> <span class="accented">they twain were cast alive into the lake</span>, etc. (On "brimstone," etc., see on Revelation 9:17, 18. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10, 14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>.) This "lake of fire" is the place of punishment for Satan and his hosts; not the place in which he at present works and reigns - which is described as the abyss (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1, 3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:11-21 Christ, the glorious Head of the church, is described as on a white horse, the emblem of justice and holiness. He has many crowns, for he is King of kings, and Lord of lords. He is arrayed in a vesture dipped in his own blood, by which he purchased his power as Mediator; and in the blood of his enemies, over whom he always prevails. His name is The Word of God; a name none fully knows but himself; only this we know, that this Word was God manifest in the flesh; but his perfections cannot be fully understood by any creature. Angels and saints follow, and are like Christ in their armour of purity and righteousness. The threatenings of the written word he is going to execute on his enemies. The ensigns of his authority are his name; asserting his authority and power, warning the most powerful princes to submit, or they must fall before him. The powers of earth and hell make their utmost effort. These verses declare important events, foretold by the prophets. These persons were not excused because they did what their leaders bade them. How vain will be the plea of many sinners at the great day! We followed our guides; we did as we saw others do! God has given a rule to walk by, in his word; neither the example of the most, nor of the chief, must influence us contrary thereto: if we do as the most do, we must go where the most go, even into the burning lake.</body></html>
