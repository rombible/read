It has afforded material for many poetic fancies, and has been the occasion of much speculative interpretation. We shall fail to catch the spirit of its meaning if we insist upon detaching the passage from its context; and the more so that the structure of the chapter seems to give an express warning against doing so. The narrative of the woman's flight into the wilderness is suspended that this passage may be inserted. Could we have a clearer indication of the anxiety of the sacred writer to connect this war in heaven with the birth and rapture of the man child? The man child is born; born a conqueror. The dragon is His foe, and the powers of the foe are not confined to the material and historical world: he is a power in the world spiritual; but the man child is to be entirely a conqueror. His rapture into heaven is the announcement that there, in the very highest, He is acknowledged victor; and His victory is won over the power of the dragon, the old serpent, whose head is now bruised. "The prince of this world cometh," said Jesus Christ, "and hath nothing in Me." "Now is the judgment of this world; now is the prince of this world cast out. And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me." Do we need more? There is mystery--unexplained mystery, perhaps--about this war in heaven, but there need be none about the general occasion referred to; it is the overthrow of the evil one by Christ: the death-blow given by the Lord of Life to him who had the power of death; it is the victory of Bethlehem, Calvary, and Olivet which is commemorated, and the effects of which are seen to transcend the sphere of the things seen. But why have we Michael and his angels introduced? This may be one of those unexplained mysteries referred to above. Some, indeed, think that this Michael is a designation of our Lord Himself, and of Him alone; but a consideration of the other passages in which Michael is mentioned (notably, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm" title="But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.">Daniel 10:13</a>, where Michael is called "one of the chief princes") leaves this limited meaning doubtful, and almost suggests conflict among the spiritual hierarchies. It may, however, be the case that the name <span class= "ital">Michael</span>--the meaning of which is, "who is like unto God"--is a general name applied to any who for the moment represent the cause of God in the great conflict against evil. It may thus belong, not to any one angel being, but be a kind of type-name used for the champion and prince of God's people, and so employed in this passage to denote Him who is the Captain of our salvation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was war in heaven</span>. The passage vers. 7-13 is an interruption of the narrative of the persecution of the woman by Satan. It is caused, apparently, by a desire to account in some degree for the relentless hostility of the devil towards God and his Church. Two explanations of the passage may be referred to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Vers. 7-13 relate to the period anterior to the Creation, concerning which we have a slight hint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>. This, on the whole, seems to agree best with the general sense of the chapter, and to present fewest difficulties. Thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> It accounts for the insertion of the passage (see above). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The war is directly between the devil and Michael, not between the devil and Christ, as at the Incarnation and Resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Vers. 8 and 9 seem to require a more literal interpretation than that which makes them refer to the effects of Christ's resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> It was not at the period of the Incarnation that the scene of Satan's opposition was transferred to the earth, as described in ver. 12. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The song of the heavenly voice may be intended to end with the word Christ (ver. 10), and the following passages may be the words of the writer of the Apocalypse, and may refer to the earthly martyrs (see on ver. 10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> This attempt of the devil in heaven may be alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, "The darkness overcame it not" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The passage may refer to the incarnation and resurrection of Christ, and the victory then won over the devil. This interpretation renders the whole passage much more figurative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Michael is the type of mankind, which in the Person of Jesus Christ vanquishes the devil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Subsequent to the Resurrection Satan is no more allowed to accuse men before God in heaven, as he has done previously (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1.htm">Job 1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-22</a>); he is thus the accuser cast down (ver. 10), and his place is no more found in heaven (ver. 8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The earth and sea represent the worldly and tumultuous nations. Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of the second view is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Michael and his angels fought against the dragon;</span> <span class="accented">Michael and his angels</span> [<span class="accented">going forth</span>] <span class="accented">to war with the dragon</span> (Revised Version). Alford explains the infinitive phrase as compounded of the genitive <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and depending upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. <span class="accented">Michael</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5db;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>) signifies, "Who is like to God?" We may compare this with the cry of the worldly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a>, "Who is like unto the beast?" In Daniel, <span class="accented">Michael</span> is the prince who stands up for the people of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 21</a>). <span class="accented">Michael</span>, "the archangel," is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a> as the great opposer of Satan. St. John, perhaps borrowing the name from Daniel, puts forward <span class="accented">Michael as</span> the chief of those who remained faithful to the cause of God in the rebellion of Satan and his angels. The <span class="accented">angels</span> of the dragon are the stars of ver. 4, which he drew with him to the earth, and possibly the reference to this event in ver. 4 gives rise to the account in vers. 7-13. Some commentators interpret the war here described as that between the Church and the world. <span class="accented">Michael</span> is thus made to be symbolical of Christ, and some have no difficulty in indicating a particular man (such as Licinius) as the antitype of the dragon. <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</span> The Greek is stronger, <span class="accented">not even their place</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, Andreas, Arethas; <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is found in P, 1, 17, and others. So complete was the defeat of Satan that he was no longer permitted to remain in heaven in any capacity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:7-11 The attempts of the dragon proved unsuccessful against the church, and fatal to his own interests. The seat of this war was in heaven; in the church of Christ, the kingdom of heaven on earth. The parties were Christ, the great Angel of the covenant, and his faithful followers; and Satan and his instruments. The strength of the church is in having the Lord Jesus for the Captain of their salvation. Pagan idolatry, which was the worship of devils, was cast out of the empire by the spreading of Christianity. The salvation and strength of the church, are only to be ascribed to the King and Head of the church. The conquered enemy hates the presence of God, yet he is willing to appear there, to accuse the people of God. Let us take heed that we give him no cause to accuse us; and that, when we have sinned, we go before the Lord, condemn ourselves, and commit our cause to Christ as our Advocate. The servants of God overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb, as the cause. By the word of their testimony: the powerful preaching of the gospel is mighty, through God, to pull down strong holds. By their courage and patience in sufferings: they loved not their lives so well but they could lay them down in Christ's cause. These were the warriors and the weapons by which Christianity overthrew the power of pagan idolatry; and if Christians had continued to fight with these weapons, and such as these, their victories would have been more numerous and glorious, and the effects more lasting. The redeemed overcame by a simple reliance on the blood of Christ, as the only ground of their hopes. In this we must be like them. We must not blend any thing else with this.</body></html>
