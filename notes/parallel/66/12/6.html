This verse simply tells us that the woman fled; we read afterwards that it was persecution which drove her into the wilderness. As long as the evil one can be called the prince of this world: as long, that is, as the world refuses to recognise her true Prince, and pays homage to worldliness, and baseness, and falseness in heart, mind, or life, so long must the Church, in so far as she is faithful to Him who is true, dwell as an exile in the wilderness. This feeling it was--not any hostility to life as life, or to life's duties--which led the Apostle to speak of Christians as strangers and pilgrims, and of the Church as another Israel, whom a greater than Moses or Joshua was conducting to a land of better promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/4-8.htm" title="For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.">Hebrews 4:8-9</a>). The woman, the representative of the Church, has a place prepared by God for her in the wilderness; she is not altogether uncared for; she has a place prepared, and nourishment. God provides her with a tabernacle of safety (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a>), and with the true Bread "which came down from heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-15.htm" title="And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.">Exodus 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-24.htm" title="And had rained down manna on them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.">Psalm 78:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-49.htm" title="Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.">John 6:49-50</a>), and with the living water from the Rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm" title="But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.">John 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-3.htm" title="And did all eat the same spiritual meat;">1Corinthians 10:3-4</a>). The time of the sojourn in the wilderness is twelve hundred and sixty days, a period corresponding in length to the forty-two months during which the witnesses prophesied; it is the period of the Church's witness against predominant evil. Driven forth, her voice, though but as the voice of one crying in the wilderness, is lifted up on behalf of righteousness and truth.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the woman fled into the wilderness.</span> As with Christ, so with his Church. His great trial took place in the wilderness; so the trial of the Church occurs in the wilderness, by which figure the world is typified. It is generally pointed out that this verse is here inserted in anticipation of ver. 14. We prefer rather to look upon it as occurring in its natural place, the narrative being interrupted by vers. 7-13 in order to account for the implacable hostility of the devil. <span class="cmt_word">Where she hath a place prepared of God</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, P, and others insert <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> as well as <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "where she there hath," etc. - a redundancy which is an ordinary Hebraism. Though the Church is "in the world," she is not "of the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14, 15</a>); though the woman is in the "wilderness," her place is "prepared of God." The harlot's abode (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>.) is in the wilderness, and it is also of the wilderness; it is not in a place specially prepared of God. <span class="cmt_word">That they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days.</span> The sense is the same as in ver. 14, "that she should be sustained there." The interpretation of the 1260 days, or 3.5 years, coincides here with that adopted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>. It describes the period of this world's existence, during the whole of which the devil persecutes the Church of God. As Auberlen points out, this is, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>, declared to be "the period of the power of the beast, that is, the world power." (For a discussion of the whole subject of this period, see on Revelation 11:2.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 The church, under the emblem of a woman, the mother of believers, was seen by the apostle in vision, in heaven. She was clothed with the sun, justified, sanctified, and shining by union with Christ, the Sun of Righteousness. The moon was under her feet; she was superior to the reflected and feebler light of the revelation made by Moses. Having on her head a crown of twelve stars; the doctrine of the gospel, preached by the twelve apostles, is a crown of glory to all true believers. As in pain to bring forth a holy family; desirous that the conviction of sinners might end in their conversion. A dragon is a known emblem of Satan, and his chief agents, or those who govern for him on earth, at that time the pagan empire of Rome, the city built upon seven hills. As having ten horns, divided into ten kingdoms. Having seven crowns, representing seven forms of government. As drawing with his tail a third part of the stars in heaven, and casting them down to the earth; persecuting and seducing the ministers and teachers. As watchful to crush the Christian religion; but in spite of the opposition of enemies, the church brought forth a manly issue of true and faithful professors, in whom Christ was truly formed anew; even the mystery of Christ, that Son of God who should rule the nations, and in whose right his members partake the same glory. This blessed offspring was protected of God.</body></html>
