They overcame him--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the accuser, the devil: their victory over him is "owing to" the blood of the Lamb. Who is he that condemneth, when Christ hath died? What power can the accusations of the adversary have when the Lamb of God hath taken away the sin of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>), and when we have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>.) Dean Alford mentions the tradition that Satan accuses men all days of the year except on the Day of Atonement. But their victory is also in virtue of the <span class= "ital">word of their testimony:</span> in virtue of the word to which they bore witness; not simply, I think, because they had a word of God to which they could bear witness, but because they had a word of God and did bear witness to it. The Christian victory is a victory of dependence and of obedience: of dependence on Him without whom they can do nothing; and of obedience to Him: it is in keeping of His commandments there is great reward: and in bearing testimony that the testimony becomes a power and a treasure. So it was the man who did Christ's commandments who was like the man whose house was founded on the rock. Theoretical religion relaxes the energy of faith, even though it may brace the intellect; practical religion invigorates faith, gives it its force, and moulds the heroism of those who, in their love of Christ, "love not their lives even unto death." It is thought that these last words imply that the martyred saints alone are spoken of. This seems to me a mistake. It is true that in the martyr we have the fullest practical token of <span class= "ital">that</span> spirit of devotion to Christ which loves Him more than life itself; but the spirit of such devotion and such love has breathed in thousands who have never died the martyr's death, but who have devoted their lives to Him they loved. The martyr spirit needs not death to show itself; many lose their lives for Christ's sake who have never been called to lay down their lives for Him, and these, as truly as those who have passed away in the shroud of flame, have loved not their lives unto the death. "He may bid us die for Him: He does bid us live for Him. If we do not the one--the less--we may be quite sure that we shall never rise to the other--the higher and the more glorious" (Dr. Vaughan).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they overcame him</span> (cf. the frequent references to those who overcome, and the promises made to them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a> , etc.). The reference "they" is to "our brethren," the accused ones of ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">By the blood of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">because of the blood</span>, etc. (Revised Version). That is, "the blood of the Lamb" is the ground or reason of their victory, not the instrument. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>, "1 John... was in the island called Patmos, <span class="accented">because of</span> the Word of God (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>). Winer agrees with this view of the present passage, against Ewald and De Wette (p. 498 of Moulton's translation). "The Lamb," who was seen "as it had been slain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>) - Christ. <span class="cmt_word">And by the word of their testimony;</span> <span class="accented">and on account of the word, etc.</span> The one phrase is the natural complement of the other. "The blood of the Lamb" would have been shed in vain without the <span class="accented">testimony</span>, the outcome of the faith of his followers; that <span class="accented">testimony</span> would have been impossible without the shedding of the blood. <span class="cmt_word">And they loved not their lives unto the death;</span> <span class="accented">their life even unto death.</span> That is, they valued not their life in this world, even to the extent of meeting death for the sake of giving their testimony. There is no article in the Greek, merely <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; so also in the same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4</a>. The article of the Authorized Version in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4</a> is probably derived from Wickliffe's Bible; that in the present passage, from Tyndale's. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:7-11 The attempts of the dragon proved unsuccessful against the church, and fatal to his own interests. The seat of this war was in heaven; in the church of Christ, the kingdom of heaven on earth. The parties were Christ, the great Angel of the covenant, and his faithful followers; and Satan and his instruments. The strength of the church is in having the Lord Jesus for the Captain of their salvation. Pagan idolatry, which was the worship of devils, was cast out of the empire by the spreading of Christianity. The salvation and strength of the church, are only to be ascribed to the King and Head of the church. The conquered enemy hates the presence of God, yet he is willing to appear there, to accuse the people of God. Let us take heed that we give him no cause to accuse us; and that, when we have sinned, we go before the Lord, condemn ourselves, and commit our cause to Christ as our Advocate. The servants of God overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb, as the cause. By the word of their testimony: the powerful preaching of the gospel is mighty, through God, to pull down strong holds. By their courage and patience in sufferings: they loved not their lives so well but they could lay them down in Christ's cause. These were the warriors and the weapons by which Christianity overthrew the power of pagan idolatry; and if Christians had continued to fight with these weapons, and such as these, their victories would have been more numerous and glorious, and the effects more lasting. The redeemed overcame by a simple reliance on the blood of Christ, as the only ground of their hopes. In this we must be like them. We must not blend any thing else with this.</body></html>
