The attempt to sweep away the Christian Church is vain. The wrath of man has always been found to turn to God's praise; the earth has always helped the woman; out of a thousand seeming defeats the Church of Christ has arisen; the banner of the Lord has been lifted up over every flood. But the foe will not give up his attacks. He can make war upon individual Christians; he may cease to assail the collective Church of Christ, but he can assail Christians by a thousand discomforts, by petty opposition, by undermining their morals, by making them unpopular, not as Christians, but as "very particular" Christians: for those thus assailed are they who "keep the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus." It is the old combination of a holy life and a fidelity to their Master which is the test of true loyalty. They take heed to themselves; they abide in Christ; they take heed to the teaching, that Christ's word may abide in them. They keep His word, and they witness to Him in lip and life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed;</span> <span class="accented">waxed wroth</span>... <span class="accented">went away to make</span>, etc. (Revised Version). Having failed to prevent the mission of' the man child - Christ Jesus - and having been foiled in his attempts to overwhelm the Church of God, Satan proceeds to attack the individual members of the Church - the seed of the woman. The method by which he endeavours to do this is related in the following chapters. Wordsworth points out an analogy between the means which Satan employs to destroy the Church as described here, and those described in the seals. The "rest of her seed" (Revised Version) signifies all the children of the woman, excluding the man child of ver. 5. All members of the Church of God are thus referred to, those who are brethren of Christ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>, "For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren"). <span class="cmt_word">Which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ</span> (nearly all manuscripts omit "Christ"); <span class="accented">hold the testimony</span> (Revised Version). This plainly points out who are the "rest of the seed" - they are those who are God's faithful servants. We may see in the description a reference to the Church of God, both Jewish and Christian. The members of the Jewish Church were they to whom "the commandments of God" were specially revealed, and Christians are they who specially "hold the testimony of Jesus." (For an explanation of the latter phrase, see on Revelation 1:2.) We have now reached another stage in the history of the warfare carried on by the devil against God. Vers. 7-12 of this chapter describe the origin of the hostility of Satan towards God; vers. 4 and 5 relate the attempts of the devil to destroy Christ and to thwart his mission; vers. 13-16 refer to the attacks of Satan upon the Church of God, by which he hoped to destroy it as a whole, before there was time for the "seed" to spring up. Having failed in every attempt, the dragon now sends other agents by whom he hopes to destroy the individual members of the Church - the other seed of the woman - the brethren of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-17 The church and all her friends might well be called to praise God for deliverance from pagan persecution, though other troubles awaited her. The wilderness is a desolate place, and full of serpents and scorpions, uncomfortable and destitute of provisions; yet a place of safety, as well as where one might be alone. But being thus retired could not protect the woman. The flood of water is explained by many to mean the invasions of barbarians, by which the western empire was overwhelmed; for the heathen encouraged their attacks, in the hope of destroying Christianity. But ungodly men, for their worldly interests, protected the church amidst these tumults, and the overthrow of the empire did not help the cause of idolatry. Or, this may be meant of a flood of error, by which the church of God was in danger of being overwhelmed and carried away. The devil, defeated in his designs upon the church, turns his rage against persons and places. Being faithful to God and Christ, in doctrine, worship, and practice, exposes to the rage of Satan; and will do so till the last enemy shall be destroyed.</body></html>
