The dragon stands for some dread and hostile power. "The dragon is that fabulous monster of whom ancient poets told, as large in size, coiled like a snake, blood red in colour . . . insatiable in voracity, and ever athirst for human blood"--a fit emblem of him whom our Lord declared to be a murderer from the beginning; for the dragon is intended here to describe him who, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm" title="And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.">Revelation 12:9</a>, is also said to be that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan. The red colour is the colour of flame and blood, and the symbol of destruction and slaughter. The dragon is the emblem of the evil spirit, the devil, the perpetual antagonist of good, the persecutor of the Church in all ages (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm" title="You did divide the sea by your strength: you brake the heads of the dragons in the waters.">Psalm 74:13</a>): just as the dragon is sometimes employed to represent the Egyptian power, the ancient foe of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm" title="Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns </span>(<span class= "ital">diadems)</span> <span class= "bld">upon his heads.</span>--This is the further description of the dragon. He is one, yet diverse; one, as an evil spirit; diverse, in the varieties of his power. The woman is hut one: but her foe is multiform; she has one trust to keep, one work to do, and can but fulfil it in her Master's way: evil is bound by no law, regards no scruple, and exerts its power through any channel and by every means. Is there not also an assumption of divine similitude here in the use of the number seven? It is at least the representation of the great and world-wide power which he exercises as the prince of this world, whose kingdom is in much a parody of the true kingdom. The whole description should be compared with the account given of the beast in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm" title="So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-7.htm" title="And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-12.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.">Revelation 17:12</a>. There the seven heads are explained as seven kings, and the heads here are crowned; the ten horns are also explained as ten kings. The sevenfold kingship and the tenfold power of the world are thus described as belonging to the dragon. The picture here, as the picture of the wild beast in Revelation 17, represents, as concentrated into a single hostile form, all the varying forces and successive empires which have opposed or oppressed the people of God, and sought to destroy their efforts for good: for all evil has its root in a spirit at enmity with God. Hence the dragon appears armed with all the insignia of those sovereignties and powers which have been animated by this spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there appeared another wonder in heaven;</span> <span class="accented">and there was seen another sign in heaven</span> (Revised Version). (See on ver. 1.) The appearance seen is not a representation of the devil as he actually is, but the sign - the dragon - is figurative and descriptive of the particular characteristics now about to be exhibited. <span class="accented">In heaven</span> - most likely merely <span class="accented">in the space above</span>, where he could be easily seen. Wordsworth, however, says, "Because the power here represented assails the Church, the kingdom of <span class="accented">heaven."</span> And behold a great red dragon. His identity is established by ver. 9, where he is called "the great dragon, the old serpent, the devil, Satan, the deceiver." <span class="accented">Red</span>; no doubt to enhance his terrible appearance; suggestive of his murderous, destructive character. <span class="accented">"Dragon"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>,) in the New Testament occurs only in this book. In the Old Testament the word is of frequent occurrence. In the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is used seventeen times to express the Hebrew <span class="accented">tannin</span> (a sea or land monster, especially a crocodile or serpent); five times it stands for <span class="accented">leviathan</span>; twice it represents <span class="accented">kephir</span> (young lion); twice <span class="accented">nachash</span> (serpent); once <span class="accented">attud</span> (he-goat); and once <span class="accented">pethen</span> (python). <span class="accented">Tannin</span> (singular) is always rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>, where we find <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; but twice it is corrupted into <span class="accented">tannim</span> (viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>). The latter word, <span class="accented">tannim</span>, is the plural of <span class="accented">tan</span> (a jackal), and is found only in the plural; but once it is found corrupted into <span class="accented">tannin</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>). There is no doubt as to the signification of the appearance. The <span class="accented">dragon</span>, is, in the Old Testament, invariably a symbol of what is harmful, tyrannous, murderous. It is a hideous, sanguinary monster, sometimes inhabiting the sea, sometimes the desolate places of the earth, always "seeking whom it may devour." In some passages it refers to Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>); in others it is a type of what is noxious or desolate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm">Job 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-19.htm">Psalm 44:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>, etc.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a> we have the combination, "leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent;... the dragon that is in the sea." <span class="cmt_word">Having seven heads and ten horns.</span> The description of the beasts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12-17</a>, is evidently derived from the vision of Daniel (7.), although the details differ. It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the interpretation generally should follow the same lines as that applied to the Old Testament symbols, with which the writer was so familiar. The appearances described in Daniel are universally considered to typify various worldly powers which oppressed the Church and nation of the Jews. Similarly here the symbolism seems intended to portray the opposition of the devil to the Church of God, working through the power of the world. The heads and horns are both declared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-10.htm">Revelation 17:10, 12</a> to typify kingdoms - in what way we shall presently see (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-10.htm">Revelation 17:10</a>). The numbers <span class="accented">seven</span> and <span class="accented">ten</span> are both symbolical of completeness (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>). We have, therefore, in this picture of the dragon, the idea of the full and complete power of the world arrayed on earth against God and his Church. This power, connected with and derived from the devil, the prince of this world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>), is often alluded to by St. John as being opposed to, or in contrast with, the godly (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15.htm">John 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16.htm">John 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17.htm">John 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-13.htm">1 John 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And seven crowns upon his heads;</span> <span class="accented">seven diadems</span> (Revised Version). That is, the kingly crown, the symbol of sovereignty, worn by the dragon to denote his power as "prince of this world." The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> is found in the New Testament only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a> and Revelation 19:12. It is not the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the crown of victory worn by the saints (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>, etc.). No account is given of the disposition and arrangement of the heads, horns, and diadems; nor is it necessary. The seven crowned heads signify universal sovereignty; the ten horns, absolute power. Probably those to whom St. John wrote understood the symbol as referring specially to the power of heathen Rome, which was at that time oppressing the Church; but the meaning extends to the power of the world in all ages (see on Revelation 13:1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 The church, under the emblem of a woman, the mother of believers, was seen by the apostle in vision, in heaven. She was clothed with the sun, justified, sanctified, and shining by union with Christ, the Sun of Righteousness. The moon was under her feet; she was superior to the reflected and feebler light of the revelation made by Moses. Having on her head a crown of twelve stars; the doctrine of the gospel, preached by the twelve apostles, is a crown of glory to all true believers. As in pain to bring forth a holy family; desirous that the conviction of sinners might end in their conversion. A dragon is a known emblem of Satan, and his chief agents, or those who govern for him on earth, at that time the pagan empire of Rome, the city built upon seven hills. As having ten horns, divided into ten kingdoms. Having seven crowns, representing seven forms of government. As drawing with his tail a third part of the stars in heaven, and casting them down to the earth; persecuting and seducing the ministers and teachers. As watchful to crush the Christian religion; but in spite of the opposition of enemies, the church brought forth a manly issue of true and faithful professors, in whom Christ was truly formed anew; even the mystery of Christ, that Son of God who should rule the nations, and in whose right his members partake the same glory. This blessed offspring was protected of God.</body></html>
