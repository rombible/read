The first attack on the woman is pictured as persecution by the dragon: from this she escapes by flight; but the subtlety of the enemy finds another device: the foe (now described as a serpent) pours forth water as a river to sweep away the woman. The emblem is nut uncommon in the Bible. Invasion is described as "an overflowing flood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/46-7.htm" title="Who is this that comes up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?">Jeremiah 46:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.">Jeremiah 47:2</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>) The same emblem is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/74-2.htm" title="Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old; the rod of your inheritance, which you have redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein you have dwelled.">Psalm 74:2-6</a> to describe the uprising of a people's ill-will. The floods, the rivers, the waves of the sea, are employed to express popular movements. The woman that cannot be destroyed by positive persecution may be swept away by a hostile public opinion. It is not the rulers alone who stand up against the Lord and His Church: an infuriated populace may be stirred up against them. The temper of the mob occasioned as much suffering and as many deaths in early Christian days as did the political authorities. Ill-regulated popular impulses, leading to violence and unwise action, whether nominally for Christianity or against it, have done enough of the devil's work in the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the serpent cast out of his month water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood;</span> <span class="accented">cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river</span>... <span class="accented">carried away by the river</span>. A <span class="accented">flood</span>, in the Old Testament, has several significations. It frequently expresses overwhelming misfortune. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-15.htm">Psalm 69:15</a>, "Let not the waterflood overflow me;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>, "Thou carriest them away as with a flood" (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-5.htm">Amos 9:5</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">flood</span> is typical of every form of destruction with which the devil seeks to overwhelm the Church of God. At the period of the writing of the Apocalypse, it plainly symbolized the bitter persecutions to which Christians were subjected; but its meaning need not be limited to this one form of destruction. Thus all those writers are correct, so far as they go, who interpret the <span class="accented">flood of</span> the Mohammedan power, of heresy, of the Gothic invasion, etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-17 The church and all her friends might well be called to praise God for deliverance from pagan persecution, though other troubles awaited her. The wilderness is a desolate place, and full of serpents and scorpions, uncomfortable and destitute of provisions; yet a place of safety, as well as where one might be alone. But being thus retired could not protect the woman. The flood of water is explained by many to mean the invasions of barbarians, by which the western empire was overwhelmed; for the heathen encouraged their attacks, in the hope of destroying Christianity. But ungodly men, for their worldly interests, protected the church amidst these tumults, and the overthrow of the empire did not help the cause of idolatry. Or, this may be meant of a flood of error, by which the church of God was in danger of being overwhelmed and carried away. The devil, defeated in his designs upon the church, turns his rage against persons and places. Being faithful to God and Christ, in doctrine, worship, and practice, exposes to the rage of Satan; and will do so till the last enemy shall be destroyed.</body></html>
