The devil, defeated in his attempts against God in heaven, and foiled in his attack upon the <span class="accented">man child</span> - Christ Jesus (see ver. 5), now directs his efforts against the <span class="accented">woman</span> - the Church. The interpretation must not be confined to one peculiar form of evil which assails the Church, but must include all - the bodily persecutions with which those to whom St. John wrote were afflicted, the heresies which arose in the Church, the lukewarnmess of her members (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-16.htm">Revelation 3:16</a>), and all others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-17 The church and all her friends might well be called to praise God for deliverance from pagan persecution, though other troubles awaited her. The wilderness is a desolate place, and full of serpents and scorpions, uncomfortable and destitute of provisions; yet a place of safety, as well as where one might be alone. But being thus retired could not protect the woman. The flood of water is explained by many to mean the invasions of barbarians, by which the western empire was overwhelmed; for the heathen encouraged their attacks, in the hope of destroying Christianity. But ungodly men, for their worldly interests, protected the church amidst these tumults, and the overthrow of the empire did not help the cause of idolatry. Or, this may be meant of a flood of error, by which the church of God was in danger of being overwhelmed and carried away. The devil, defeated in his designs upon the church, turns his rage against persons and places. Being faithful to God and Christ, in doctrine, worship, and practice, exposes to the rage of Satan; and will do so till the last enemy shall be destroyed.</body></html>
