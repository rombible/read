There is an anguish of the Church which Christ laid upon her; it is the law of her life that she must bring forth Christ to the world; it is not simply that she must encounter pain, but that she cannot work deliverance without knowing suffering. Thus the Apostles felt: the love of Christ constrained them; woe it would be to them if they did not preach the Gospel; necessity was laid upon them; they spoke of themselves as travailing in birth over their children till Christ was formed in them. This, then, is the picture, the Church fulfilling her destiny even in pain. The work was to bring forth Christ to men, and never to be satisfied till Christ was formed in them, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> till the spirit of Christ, and the teaching of Christ, and the example of Christ were received, loved, and obeyed, and men transformed to the same image, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.<p>But there was to be opposition; the enemy is on the watch to destroy the likeness of Christ wherever it was seen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</span> The present, "crieth," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, P, Coptic, Andreas in <span class="accented">a</span> et <span class="accented">bav.</span>, etc.; the imperfect, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, is read in C, Vulgate, 7, 8, 31, etc., Andreas in <span class="accented">c</span> et <span class="accented">p</span>, Primasius; the aorist, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, in B, twelve cursives (cf. the words of our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21, 22</a>).

The trouble which afflicted the Jewish Church, and the longing of the patriarchs for the advent of the Saviour, are here depicted. So also St. Paul, encouraging the Romans to bear patiently their sufferings, says, "The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 The church, under the emblem of a woman, the mother of believers, was seen by the apostle in vision, in heaven. She was clothed with the sun, justified, sanctified, and shining by union with Christ, the Sun of Righteousness. The moon was under her feet; she was superior to the reflected and feebler light of the revelation made by Moses. Having on her head a crown of twelve stars; the doctrine of the gospel, preached by the twelve apostles, is a crown of glory to all true believers. As in pain to bring forth a holy family; desirous that the conviction of sinners might end in their conversion. A dragon is a known emblem of Satan, and his chief agents, or those who govern for him on earth, at that time the pagan empire of Rome, the city built upon seven hills. As having ten horns, divided into ten kingdoms. Having seven crowns, representing seven forms of government. As drawing with his tail a third part of the stars in heaven, and casting them down to the earth; persecuting and seducing the ministers and teachers. As watchful to crush the Christian religion; but in spite of the opposition of enemies, the church brought forth a manly issue of true and faithful professors, in whom Christ was truly formed anew; even the mystery of Christ, that Son of God who should rule the nations, and in whose right his members partake the same glory. This blessed offspring was protected of God.</body></html>
