The stronger than the strong one has come, and taken away his armour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-21.htm" title="When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace:">Luke 11:21-22</a>). The death-blow is given. The prince of this world (who found nothing in Christ) is judged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm" title="Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.">John 16:11</a>). The adversary is described as the dragon, the fierce and cruel foe who is ever ready to devour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>). <span class= "ital">The ancient serpent.</span> The serpent was used as an emblem of the evil principle.

But the head of the ancient foe of man is now bruised: he is the devil, the accuser and calumniator.

"The dragon:" so called, because he is the destroyer (see on ver. 3). "The ancient serpent," as he was revealed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a> he is "the destroyer from the beginning." "The devil" (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is the Greek rendering of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Satan</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, "the accuser, the adversary;" reference is made in ver. 10 to the signification of the name, "The Deceiver." Wordsworth says, "The deceits by which Satan cheated the world in oracles, sorcery, soothsaying, magic, and other frauds, are here specially noticed. These were put to flight by the power of Christ and of the Holy Ghost, in the preaching of the gospel by the apostles and others in the first ages of Christianity. Our Lord himself, speaking of the consequence of the preaching of the seventy disciples, reveals the spiritual struggle and the victory: 'I was beholding Satan as lightning fall from heaven' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17, 18</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him;</span> <span class="accented">cast down to the earth</span>, etc. (Revised Version). "To the earth" in a twofold sense: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the phrase is a description of the loss of dignity and power on the part of Satan, in being cast to <span class="accented">earth</span> as opposed to heaven; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">earth</span> is the scene of his future operations, where he may still in some degree sustain the struggle against God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:7-11 The attempts of the dragon proved unsuccessful against the church, and fatal to his own interests. The seat of this war was in heaven; in the church of Christ, the kingdom of heaven on earth. The parties were Christ, the great Angel of the covenant, and his faithful followers; and Satan and his instruments. The strength of the church is in having the Lord Jesus for the Captain of their salvation. Pagan idolatry, which was the worship of devils, was cast out of the empire by the spreading of Christianity. The salvation and strength of the church, are only to be ascribed to the King and Head of the church. The conquered enemy hates the presence of God, yet he is willing to appear there, to accuse the people of God. Let us take heed that we give him no cause to accuse us; and that, when we have sinned, we go before the Lord, condemn ourselves, and commit our cause to Christ as our Advocate. The servants of God overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb, as the cause. By the word of their testimony: the powerful preaching of the gospel is mighty, through God, to pull down strong holds. By their courage and patience in sufferings: they loved not their lives so well but they could lay them down in Christ's cause. These were the warriors and the weapons by which Christianity overthrew the power of pagan idolatry; and if Christians had continued to fight with these weapons, and such as these, their victories would have been more numerous and glorious, and the effects more lasting. The redeemed overcame by a simple reliance on the blood of Christ, as the only ground of their hopes. In this we must be like them. We must not blend any thing else with this.</body></html>
