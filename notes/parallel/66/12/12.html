This is the cause of joy to the heavens, and to them that tabernacle (not "dwell") in them. The word is (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-15.htm" title="Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them.">Revelation 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-6.htm" title="And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.">Revelation 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.">Revelation 21:3</a>) "tabernacle." This allusion to the tabernacle where the glory of God and the mercy-seat were to be found, is not without force. The sacred imagery of the tabernacle of witness calls to mind the safe dwelling which the sanctuary of God afforded to those whose testimony was given in the wilderness of sorrow. Those who tabernacled in the secret place of the Most High could rejoice with joy unspeakable.<p><span class= "bld">Woe to</span> <span class= "bld">the inhabiters . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">Woe to the earth and the sea!</span> (the words "to the inhabiters of" are not found in the best MSS.) <span class= "ital">because the devil is gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing</span> (or, <span class= "ital">because he knoweth:</span> his knowledge that his season of power is short is the reason of his great wrath) <span class= "ital">that he hath </span>(<span class= "ital">but</span>)<span class= "ital"> a short season.</span> The painful consciousness of defeat has roused a deeper and more obstinate rage. Sin, which blunts the conscience, blinds the reason, and drives men madly to attempt the impossible, or to rouse<p>"the unconquerable will<p>And study of revenge, immortal hate,<p>And courage never to submit or yield."<p>The <span class= "ital">woe</span> to the sea and earth is simply a warning voice to all that, though the foe is overcome and death smitten, yet that he has power, quickened by defeat and fear, for a last struggle; and that therefore they need to be sober and vigilant against the adversary. His season is short. He may be active, sowing tares among the wheat and animating various hostile powers, such as the wild beasts of Revelation 13; but he has only a season: there is a limit to his power and the time of his power. "A little while "was the word our Lord used to denote His time of absence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-16.htm" title="A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.">John 16:16-22</a>):" Behold, He comes quickly!"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them;</span> <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">heavens</span> (Revised Version). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "that dwell," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, 26, 29, 30, 31, 98, Andreas, Vulgate, Primasius, Memphitie, Armenian. The Revisers have followed the <span class="accented">common reading of</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "tabernacled," which is found in the majority of manuscripts. Alford observes, "There is no sense of transitoriness in St. John's use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, rather one of repose and tranquillity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>)." <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is found in C. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-6.htm">Revelation 13:6</a> the abiding place of God is called his <span class="accented">tabernacle.</span> These are the words of the writer (see on ver. 10). The cause for this rejoicing has been given in ver. 9; the devil having been cast out, those in heaven enjoy absolute immunity from all harm which he can work. <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea!</span> <span class="accented">Woe for the earth and for the sea!</span> (Revised Version). A few cursives give <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to the dwellers." The influence of the devil works woe to the whole world - to the human inhabitants, to the animal and vegetable life of the earth which was cursed for man's sake (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time;</span> or, <span class="accented">came down</span> (aorist). "A short season" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) in which to exist in the world. His <span class="accented">wrath</span>, kindled by his ejectment from heaven, is the greater because of the comparative shortness of his reign on earth. This "short season" is the period of the world's existence from the advent of Satan till the final judgment. It is <span class="accented">short</span> in comparison with eternity, and it is frequently thus described in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-28.htm">Romans 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>, etc.). It is the "little time" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; the "little season" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>, during which Satan must be loosed. Here ends the digression descriptive of the struggle in heaven before the creation of the world, and the following verses take up and continue the narrative which was interrupted after ver. 6. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:12-17 The church and all her friends might well be called to praise God for deliverance from pagan persecution, though other troubles awaited her. The wilderness is a desolate place, and full of serpents and scorpions, uncomfortable and destitute of provisions; yet a place of safety, as well as where one might be alone. But being thus retired could not protect the woman. The flood of water is explained by many to mean the invasions of barbarians, by which the western empire was overwhelmed; for the heathen encouraged their attacks, in the hope of destroying Christianity. But ungodly men, for their worldly interests, protected the church amidst these tumults, and the overthrow of the empire did not help the cause of idolatry. Or, this may be meant of a flood of error, by which the church of God was in danger of being overwhelmed and carried away. The devil, defeated in his designs upon the church, turns his rage against persons and places. Being faithful to God and Christ, in doctrine, worship, and practice, exposes to the rage of Satan; and will do so till the last enemy shall be destroyed.</body></html>
