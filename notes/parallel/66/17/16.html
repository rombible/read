The woman in the days of the Evangelist was Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-18.htm" title="And the woman which you saw is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.">Revelation 17:18</a>), but great and resistless as her power seemed, it was doomed; the day would come when other kingdoms would rise who would hate her for her tyranny, envy her splendour, and covet her wealth. Then the great Babylon would fall, like Jezebel of old; the painted cheek, the pencilled eyebrow, and the amorous glance have lost their fascination; those who have pandered to her vices would turn against her, and cast her out to be trampled under foot. So did the Babylon of St. John's day fall--perishing in the blood that she had spilt, or left "childless and crownless in her voiceless woe."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast;</span> <span class="accented">and the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast.</span> There is no authority for the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of Erasmus except the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in bestia</span>, and, of course, the description given of the beast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, etc,). The two are spoken of separately, on account of the separate juris diction wielded according to vers. 32, 13. <span class="cmt_word">These shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire;</span> <span class="accented">and shall burn her utterly with fire</span> (Revised Version). These words describe the fate in store for the faithless portion of the Church. That world, to which she trusts, shall turn and rend her - a fitting sequel to her want of faith in the power of Christ. This is exactly the description given of the harlot in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-37.htm">Ezekiel 16:37</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-22.htm">Ezekiel 23:22</a>). "Eat her flesh" and "burn with fire" both describe similar results; possibly the one is thought of in connection with the symbol of "harlot," the other with the symbol of "city," with which the harlot is identical (see on ver. 5; but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-24.htm">Genesis 38:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>; cf. also the judgment upon the wicked rich in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>, "shall eat your flesh as it were fire"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:15-18 God so ruled the hearts of these kings, by his power over them, and by his providence, that they did those things, without intending it, which he purposed and foretold. They shall see their folly, and how they have been bewitched and enslaved by the harlot, and be made instruments in her destruction. She was that great city which reigned over the kings of the earth, when John had this vision; and every one knows Rome to be that city. Believers will be received to the glory of the Lord, when wicked men will be destroyed in a most awful manner; their joining together in sin, will be turned to hatred and rage, and they will eagerly assist in tormenting each other. But the Lord's portion is his people; his counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure, to his glory, and the happiness of all his servants.</body></html>
