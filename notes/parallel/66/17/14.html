This war between the Lamb and the powers of evil is that which extends throughout the history of the world (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>); it occupies the "one hour" of ver. 12, which is equivalent to the period of the world's existence. But the seer in this verse looks forward also to the termination of the conflict, the result of which, here briefly indicated, is soon to be narrated more fully. <span class="cmt_word">For he is Lord of lords, and King of kings.</span> This is the reason given to the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>) for obedience to God (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). Though the beast may exercise m this world dominion and power as "prince of this world," yet the Lamb is King still greater, to whom the beast must finally succumb. He is thus <span class="accented">King</span> above the kings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2, 10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</span> The Revised Version is more correct, <span class="accented">And they that are with him, called and chosen and faithful</span> [<span class="accented">shall also overcome</span>]. Another evidence of the lifelong nature of this war. Not only Christ wars and overcomes, but those associated with him are permitted to share in the battle and the victory. Christ's saints are <span class="accented">called</span> here to battle; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a> they are <span class="accented">called</span> to the marriage supper of the Lamb (cf. also the exhortation to <span class="accented">faithfulness</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>). The three epithets describe the progressive life of those who share Christ's victory They are <span class="accented">called</span> - as all men are - to serve him; having heard the call, they dedicate their lives to his service, and become his <span class="accented">chosen</span> servants; finally, having remained <span class="accented">faithful</span> to him, they share in his victory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-14 The beast on which the woman sat was, and is not, and yet is. It was a seat of idolatry and persecution, and is not; not in the ancient form, which was pagan: yet it is; it is truly the seat of idolatry and tyranny, though of another sort and form. It would deceive into stupid and blind submission all the inhabitants of the earth within its influence, except the remnant of the elect. This beast was seven heads, seven mountains, the seven hills on which Rome stands; and seven kings, seven sorts of government. Five were gone by when this prophecy was written; one was then in being; the other was yet to come. This beast, directed by the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatry again. It had ten horns, which are said to be ten kings who had as yet no kingdoms; they should not rise up till the Roman empire was broken; but should for a time be very zealous in her interest. Christ must reign till all enemies be put under his feet. The reason of the victory is, that he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has supreme dominion and power over all things; all the powers of earth and hell are subject to his control. His followers are called to this warfare, are fitted for it, and will be faithful in it.</body></html>
