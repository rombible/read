Attention is asked to the fuller explanation which follows. It needs true wisdom to behold many incidents of the world's history and not find stumbling-blocks in them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/73-2.htm" title="But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well near slipped.">Psalm 73:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-165.htm" title="Great peace have they which love your law: and nothing shall offend them.">Psalm 119:165</a>). <span class= "ital">The seven heads are seven mountains where the woman sitteth upon them.</span> The description seems to be drawn from Rome, the seven-hilled city. This keeps the reference to Rome before us, but at the same time the further explanation (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>) widens our thoughts, and shows us that the literalism on which the imagery is based is used to convey a broader symbolical meaning. <span class= "ital">The seven heads are seven mountains, &c.,</span> <span class= "ital">and they</span> (the seven heads; the words "There are seven kings" in the English version are confusing) <span class= "ital">are seven kings:</span> the woman rides on the seven-headed beast; even so Rome dwells on her seven hills, and so also the world-city, seen in vision, sits among the various empires which have risen, like great mountains, in the history of the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And here is the mind which hath wisdom.</span> Omit "and." Read, <span class="accented">Here is the mind</span> (or, <span class="accented">meaning</span>), etc. These words (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>) draw attention to the explanation which follows - or else that which precedes (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>). They also make it appear that the explanation which the angel offers of the "mystery" is not one to be understood without some difficulty. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. The diversity of opinions on the interpretation of this passage is mainly owing to the fact that writers are not consistent in their application of symbols and numbers; in one place interpreting figuratively, in another literally. We have repeatedly seen that the language of the Apocalypse and its numbers are symbolical. The seals are not literal seals, the Lamb is not a literal Lamb, the beast is not a literal beast, etc. So here, the <span class="accented">mountains</span> are not literal mountains. A mountain is a symbol of power (see on Revelation 8:8); <span class="accented">seven</span> is the number significant of universality (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). The plain meaning of the passage, therefore, is that the woman relies upon a visibly universal power. This is precisely the idea contained in ver. 3, which describes the faithless part of the Church (the harlot) trusting to the power of the world (the beast). Of course, the most prominent form of this world power in St. John's time was heathen Rome, hence some writers believe that "the seven-hilled city," Rome, is referred to here - either pagan or papal Rome. And, indeed, this may be a partial fulfilment of the vision; but it is not the whole signification. To understand <span class="accented">seven mountains</span> literally in this place renders it necessary to interpret forty-two weeks, etc., literally in another. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-14 The beast on which the woman sat was, and is not, and yet is. It was a seat of idolatry and persecution, and is not; not in the ancient form, which was pagan: yet it is; it is truly the seat of idolatry and tyranny, though of another sort and form. It would deceive into stupid and blind submission all the inhabitants of the earth within its influence, except the remnant of the elect. This beast was seven heads, seven mountains, the seven hills on which Rome stands; and seven kings, seven sorts of government. Five were gone by when this prophecy was written; one was then in being; the other was yet to come. This beast, directed by the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatry again. It had ten horns, which are said to be ten kings who had as yet no kingdoms; they should not rise up till the Roman empire was broken; but should for a time be very zealous in her interest. Christ must reign till all enemies be put under his feet. The reason of the victory is, that he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has supreme dominion and power over all things; all the powers of earth and hell are subject to his control. His followers are called to this warfare, are fitted for it, and will be faithful in it.</body></html>
