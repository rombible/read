Against Babylon the voices of the prophets were lifted up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-9.htm" title="And, behold, here comes a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he has broken to the ground.">Isaiah 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm" title="Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, said the LORD, which destroy all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.">Jeremiah 51:25</a>); she seemed to them the embodiment of splendid vice and resistless power; "the glory of kingdoms," "the golden city," "who exalted her throne above the stars of God," "who sat as a lady given to pleasures, and flattering herself that she would see no sorrow." In her greatness and her hostility to Jerusalem she became a type of later world-powers; and, in St. John's vision, Babylon, in her purple and her pomp, in her luxurious ness and her tyranny, takes her place. And it is explained in the vision that Babylon is no longer the literal Babylon, but the power which has taken her place of pride and empire. That power was Rome. Rome was in St. John's day just what Babylon had been in the days of the prophets--"the hammer of the whole earth," the "golden cup that made all the earth drunken" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm" title="How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!">Jeremiah 50:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-7.htm" title="Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.">Jeremiah 51:7</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-2.htm" title="With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.">Revelation 17:2</a> of this chapter). At the same time, the way in which the Evangelist transfers to the Rome of his day the prophetic language which earlier prophets applied to ancient Babylon (compare these chapters, Revelation 17, 18, with Isaiah 47, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/51-6.htm" title="Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.">Jeremiah 51:6-14</a>) ought to be sufficient to warn us against limited and local interpretations, even if the seven-headed wild beast did not show us that the world-power, like the moral principles of which Babylon and Rome were examples, is not confined to one age. If we remember this, we shall see that the Babylon of the Apocalypse, while, undoubtedly, Pagan Rome, cannot be limited to it. Is it, then, the question must be asked, Papal Rome? The answer is: In so far as Papal Rome has wielded tyrant power, turned persecutor, stood between the spirits of men and Christ, depraved men's consciences, withheld the truth, connived at viciousness, sought aggrandisement, and been a political engine rather than a witness for the righteous King, she has inherited the features of Babylon. The recognition of these features led Dante to apply this very passage in the Apocalypse to Rome under the rule of worldly and tyrant popes, when he exclaimed to the shade of Nicholas III. (<span class= "ital">Il compiuto</span>)<span class= "ital">:</span>--<p>"Of shepherds like to you the Evangelist<p>Was ware, when her who sits upon the waves<p>With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld:<p>She who with seven heads tower'd at her birth,<p>And from ten horns her proof of glory drew<p>Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.<p>Of gold and silver ye have made your god,<p>Differing wherein from the idolater,<p>But that he worships one, a hundred ye!"<p><span class= "ital">--Inferno, </span>Cant, xix., 109-117.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me;</span> <span class="accented">and spake with me, saying.</span> Omit "unto me." This and the following chapters (to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-21.htm">Revelation 19:21</a>) consist of visions which are really included under the seventh vial, but which, on account of their length and elaboration, may be considered apart from the other judgments of that vial. In the preceding chapters we have had placed before us a conspectus of three classes of ungodly people, and the three principles of evil in their abstract form, as represented by the world (the first beast), the flesh (the second beast), and the devil (the dragon). The personal final overthrow of the devil is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. and 18, are devoted to the description of the judgments of the two former - the world, in its character of the openly hostile persecutor of the Church of God; and the other portion of the ungodly who, while still professing Christianity, find excuses for conforming to the worship of the image of the beast. The first beast is, therefore, identical with Babylon, and represents, as we have seen, the openly hostile and persecuting world power of all ages, of which, in St. John's time, Rome was the foremost embodiment. The second beast is identical with the harlot, and represents faithless Christians, the apostate portion of the Church. The very <span class="accented">raison d'etre</span> of the Apocalypse is to deal with these two forms of evil; to declare the overthrow of the one, and to warn and, if possible, reclaim those under the influence of the other. In the latter case, the warning consists in setting forth the judgment in store for faithless Christians; and as this is the course pursued with the former also, the two merge into one, and indeed are declared to be one. The apostle in substance declares that, though there is a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> difference between the two forms of ungodliness, there is in reality no distinction to be made, but both are involved in one common final judgment. He thus twice solemnly asserts that the harlot is Babylon (vers. 5 and 18). The comments upon the following chapters will be based upon this hypothesis, the reasons for which will be brought out more clearly as we proceed. The opening words of this chapter leave no doubt that the visions which follow are connected with the vial judgments. The "one of the seven angels" may be the seventh angel, to whom it pertained to unfold the circumstances connected with the last judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment.</span> <span class="accented">Hither</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;</span>, without the verb, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>. Though this particular narration necessarily takes place after the account of the vials, yet we are not to understand that the events here related are subsequent to these related in the concluding verses of the previous chapter. Note the remarkable similarity between these words and these of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>, and the contrast between the bride, the wife of the Lamb, and the harlot who is connected with the beast. Wordsworth carries the comparison even to the form of words, thus - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The harlot and the beast.<br /><span class="greek">&#x397;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x397;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span><br />The bride and the Lamb. <span class="cmt_word">Of the great whore;</span> <span class="accented">harlot</span> (Revised Version). There seems no doubt that this figure describes the degenerate portion of the Church of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As we have already seen, this symbolism is made use of by St. John to portray the faithlessness of those who are professedly servants of God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>), and in this sense it is applied in the great majority of passages of Scripture where it occurs (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-3.htm">Hosea 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-7.htm">Micah 1:7</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-14.htm">Nahum 3:14</a> the term refers to Tyre and Nineveh respectively. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There is an intended contrast between the bride and the Lamb, and the harlot who allies herself with the beast (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> A contrast is also probably intended between the woman clothed with the sun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>.), bringing forth the man child, Christ Jesus the Saviour - the representation of the pure Church - and the harlot clothed in scarlet, the mother of harlots and abominations - the representation of the faithless part of the Church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Both the woman of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. and the harlot of this chapter reside in the wilderness, that is, this world (see on Revelation 12:14); indeed, they are to men sometimes indistinguishable (cf. the parable of the wheat and tares). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The faithful Church, the bride, is called a city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 9, 10</a>); so the faithless portion of the Church, the harlot, is identified with the city Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4, 5</a>). Other coincidences will be noted as we proceed. But it seems equally impossible to accept the view that this faithless portion of the Church refers to papal Rome, <span class="accented">and none other.</span> We must include all the faithless of God's Church in all time. If the fulfilment is to be limited at all, it seems more reasonable to suppose that the first reference of St. John was to the faithless members of the seven Churches to which he addresses the Apocalypse. But we are, no doubt, intended to see here a picture of the position of the unfaithful part of the Church wherever it exists, at any time, and which men are certainly not able always to specify and judge. On this point see Professor Milligan's 'Baird Lectures' for 1885, on "The Revelation of St. John." In lect. 5. he says, "But Babylon is not the Church of Rome in particular. Deeply, no doubt, that Church has sinned. ... Yet the interpretation is false .... Babylon cannot be Christian Rome; and nothing has been more injurious to the Protestant Churches than the impression that the two were identical, and that, by withdrawing from communion with the pope, they wholly freed themselves from alliance with the spiritual harlot. Babylon embraces much more than Rome, and illustrations of what she is lie nearer our own door. Wherever professedly Christian men have thought the world's favour better than its reproach; wherever they have esteemed its honours a more desirable possession than its shame; wherever they have courted ease rather than welcomed suffering, have loved self indulgence rather than self sacrifice, and have substituted covetousness in grasping for generosity in distributing what they had, - there the spirit of Babylon has been manifested. In short, we have in the great harlot city neither the Christian Church as a whole, nor the Romish Church in particular, but all who anywhere within the Church profess to be Christ's 'little flock' and are not, denying in their lives the main characteristic by which they ought to be distinguished - that they 'follow' Christ." (For the distinction between the harlot and Babylon, see above.) <span class="cmt_word">That sitteth upon many waters</span>. "The" is inserted in B and other manuscripts, probably on account of the reference in ver. 15, but is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, P, and others. This is the description of Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>, whence, doubtless, the expression is derived. In the place quoted, the sentence refers to the many canals of Babylon; but the interpretation of this passage is given in ver. 15, where the <span class="accented">waters</span> are stated to be "peoples." This fact sufficiently demonstrates that, though the imagery of the Apocalypse be taken from the Old Testament, it is not always safe to insist on an exactly similar interpretation; the symbols employed may be applied in an independent manner. That the harlot sits on many waters therefore shows us that the faithless portion of the Church is to be found distributed amongst "peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 Rome clearly appears to be meant in this chapter. Pagan Rome subdued and ruled with military power, not by art and flatteries. She left the nations in general to their ancient usages and worship. But it is well known that by crafty and politic management, with all kinds of deceit of unrighteousness, papal Rome has obtained and kept her rule over kings and nations. Here were allurements of worldly honour and riches, pomp and pride, suited to sensual and worldly minds. Prosperity, pomp, and splendour, feed the pride and lusts of the human heart, but are no security against the Divine vengeance. The golden cup represents the allurements, and delusions, by which this mystical Babylon has obtained and kept her influence, and seduced others to join her abominations. She is named, from her infamous practices, a mother of harlots; training them up to idolatry and all sorts of wickedness. She filled herself with the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus. She intoxicated herself with it; and it was so pleasant to her, that she never was satisfied. We cannot but wonder at the oceans of Christian blood shed by men called Christians; yet when we consider these prophecies, these awful deeds testify to the truth of the gospel. And let all beware of a splendid, gainful, or fashionable religion. Let us avoid the mysteries of iniquity, and study diligently the great mystery of godliness, that we may learn humility and gratitude from the example of Christ. The more we seek to resemble him, the less we shall be liable to be deceived by antichrist.</body></html>
