Now the wild beast carries the woman; for she draws her support from the great world-power. The scene is the wilderness. The contrast between the desolation around her and the splendour of her appearance is striking and suggestive. The woman clothed with the sun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-1.htm" title="And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars:">Revelation 12:1</a>), persecuted by the dragon, finds a home in the wilderness into which she is driven. She is persecuted, but not forsaken; she can joy in tribulation. The scarlet-clad woman, amid all her dazzling surroundings, is still in a wilderness. The runagates continue in scarceness. Sansjoy is the brother of Sansloy. The wild beast is scarlet in colour. The dragon was red (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a>); the woman is clothed in scarlet. Is it the emblem of lawlessness ending in violence? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm" title="Come now, and let us reason together, said the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.">Isaiah 1:18</a>). It has also a show of sovereignty.<p><span class= "bld">Full of names.</span>--<span class= "ital">Teeming with names, &c.</span>--The living creatures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a>) <span class= "ital">teemed</span> (the same word as here) with eyes, the tokens of ready obedience and true intelligence. The wild beast teems with tokens of lawlessness and self-sufficiency.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he carried me away in the spirit;</span> <span class="accented">and he carried</span>, etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a> and Revelation 21:10). In the latter reference the analogy is sufficiently close to lead us to believe that it is intended. <span class="cmt_word">Into the wilderness;</span> <span class="accented">a wilderness</span>, according to the Revised Version, which is the rendering of Wordsworth and others; but Alford strongly supports the Authorized Version rendering, notwithstanding the absence of the Greek article (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). Some commentators have thought that the "wilderness" signifies the desolation which is the lot of the harlot (see ver. 16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2, 19</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-26.htm">Jeremiah 51:26</a>). But we can hardly avoid the conclusion that the "wilderness" here is that spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6, 14</a>, which is symbolical of this world, particularly when we remember that the "wilderness" in both cases is the abode of a woman, who moreover is representative of the Church; though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. she represents the Church of God as a whole, persecuted by Satan, and in this place the woman is representative of the faithless part of the Church (see also below on "beast"). Vitringa, referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-35.htm">Ezekiel 20:35</a>, arrives at a similar conclusion; it is a "wilderness of the people." <span class="cmt_word">And I saw a woman.</span> There is no article, but this vision, occurring immediately after the words of ver. 1, "I will show thee... the great harlot," identifies this <span class="accented">woman</span> with the harlot of ver. 1. This woman represents the faithless portion of the Church (see on ver. 1); that part which, following after worldly things, has thereby rendered to the beast the love and honour due to God alone. This woman is not identical with the woman of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. The latter represents the faithful, the former the faithless, part of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Sit upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</span> Here again, as in "wilderness" (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), we have <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "beast," without the article; but the identity of this "beast" with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a> is established by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the same outward characteristics of names of blasphemy, seven heads and ten horns; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> its connection with "kings," etc. (vers. 12-14 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19, 20</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> its connection with the "false prophet" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. and Revelation 19:20); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> its connection with the harlot - the one representing the world power, the other the faithless, worldly portion of the Church. That the <span class="accented">woman sits upon the beast</span> denotes, not that she exercises control and guidance over it (as Alford), for comp. ver. 16, but rather that the <span class="accented">woman</span> relies upon the <span class="accented">beast</span> for support and safety; thus presenting an accurate description of those who prefer to trust to the power and influence of the world rather than to God. <span class="accented">Scarlet</span> (whether the colour of the beast itself or of its trappings is immaterial) may signify either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the worldly pre-eminence and power of which it is the sign, and for which the woman allies herself with the beast; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the blood-stained persecution of which the beast is the author. The first interpretation coincides best with the words which immediately follow; the second one agrees with the description in ver. 6 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>. (On the "names of blasphemy," as signifying opposition to and rivalry with God, see on Revelation 13:1.) The <span class="accented">seven heads</span> denote universality of (earthly) dominion, and the <span class="accented">ten horns</span> denote plenitude of power (see on Revelation 13:1). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 Rome clearly appears to be meant in this chapter. Pagan Rome subdued and ruled with military power, not by art and flatteries. She left the nations in general to their ancient usages and worship. But it is well known that by crafty and politic management, with all kinds of deceit of unrighteousness, papal Rome has obtained and kept her rule over kings and nations. Here were allurements of worldly honour and riches, pomp and pride, suited to sensual and worldly minds. Prosperity, pomp, and splendour, feed the pride and lusts of the human heart, but are no security against the Divine vengeance. The golden cup represents the allurements, and delusions, by which this mystical Babylon has obtained and kept her influence, and seduced others to join her abominations. She is named, from her infamous practices, a mother of harlots; training them up to idolatry and all sorts of wickedness. She filled herself with the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus. She intoxicated herself with it; and it was so pleasant to her, that she never was satisfied. We cannot but wonder at the oceans of Christian blood shed by men called Christians; yet when we consider these prophecies, these awful deeds testify to the truth of the gospel. And let all beware of a splendid, gainful, or fashionable religion. Let us avoid the mysteries of iniquity, and study diligently the great mystery of godliness, that we may learn humility and gratitude from the example of Christ. The more we seek to resemble him, the less we shall be liable to be deceived by antichrist.</body></html>
