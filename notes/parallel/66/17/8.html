"And to go" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B. P, Vulgate, and almost all cursives; while <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "he goeth," is found in A, 12, Arethas, Irenaeus. The latter part of this passage is related again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>. <span class="accented">The beast</span>, as we have seen is the world power - Satan in his character of "prince of this world." Three stages are marked out in the existence of this world power: first, it <span class="accented">was</span>; second, it <span class="accented">is not</span> now; thirdly, it reappears, to be cast into perdition. The first period describes the condition of things before the sacrifice of Christ. Then it was that Satan ruled supreme in the world; that the power of the world - <span class="accented">the beast - was.</span> But Christ overcame the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); henceforth to all true believers there is "peace," although they may "have tribulation" in the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); for the faithful Christian the power of the world - <span class="accented">the beast - is not.</span> Yet, though for the true servant of God there is a sense in which it may be said that this power has no existence, it nevertheless exists in the abyss, that is, in its natural abiding place in the world, among the worldly minded, and thus may cause "tribulation" to the faithful. A further downfall is, therefore, prepared for it - that which will take place at the last day, when it "will ascend from the abyss to go into perdition." This nonexistence, contemporaneously with existence and subsequent reappearance, is exactly what is described in the wound healed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a>; see also the remainder of this verse). The period, therefore, embraced in these words is that of the whole existence of this world. It coincides with the period referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a> and 17, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>. Throughout the Apocalypse the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, translated "bottomless pit" (Authorized Version) and "abyss" (Revised Version), is used to describe the dwelling place of Satan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1, 2, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1, 3</a>) while working in the world. "Perdition" is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> as the "lake of fire burning with brimstone." <span class="cmt_word">And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is;</span> <span class="accented">whose name hath not been written upon the book</span>... <span class="accented">beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall be present.</span> The last words show exactly what is meant in the first part of the verse (which see). The first words are a repetition of words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a> (which see). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:7-14 The beast on which the woman sat was, and is not, and yet is. It was a seat of idolatry and persecution, and is not; not in the ancient form, which was pagan: yet it is; it is truly the seat of idolatry and tyranny, though of another sort and form. It would deceive into stupid and blind submission all the inhabitants of the earth within its influence, except the remnant of the elect. This beast was seven heads, seven mountains, the seven hills on which Rome stands; and seven kings, seven sorts of government. Five were gone by when this prophecy was written; one was then in being; the other was yet to come. This beast, directed by the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatry again. It had ten horns, which are said to be ten kings who had as yet no kingdoms; they should not rise up till the Roman empire was broken; but should for a time be very zealous in her interest. Christ must reign till all enemies be put under his feet. The reason of the victory is, that he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has supreme dominion and power over all things; all the powers of earth and hell are subject to his control. His followers are called to this warfare, are fitted for it, and will be faithful in it.</body></html>
