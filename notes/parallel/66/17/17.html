In these enterprises they act unitedly; there is given to them to make "one mind." But they are only carrying out the righteous will of God; God wills that the harlot shall fall; and even in their war upon the Lamb, they are but preparing for the crisis when the foes of the righteous King shall fall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-19.htm" title="And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.">Revelation 19:19</a>).

"His mind" is thought by Bengel, De Wette, and Dusterdieck to signify the beast's mind. Others understand God's mind. In either ease the general sense is plain. While the world power is apparently performing the will of the beast, God is working above all; only by his permission can anything be done (cf. the "it was given" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>.). The "words of God" are his denunciations against those who trust to the world (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-37.htm">Ezekiel 16:37</a>, quoted on ver. 16). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:15-18 God so ruled the hearts of these kings, by his power over them, and by his providence, that they did those things, without intending it, which he purposed and foretold. They shall see their folly, and how they have been bewitched and enslaved by the harlot, and be made instruments in her destruction. She was that great city which reigned over the kings of the earth, when John had this vision; and every one knows Rome to be that city. Believers will be received to the glory of the Lord, when wicked men will be destroyed in a most awful manner; their joining together in sin, will be turned to hatred and rage, and they will eagerly assist in tormenting each other. But the Lord's portion is his people; his counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure, to his glory, and the happiness of all his servants.</body></html>
