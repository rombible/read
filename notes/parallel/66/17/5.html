Others, in smaller spheres, will follow her example; but she is the origin and type of all.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints.</span>--It is said later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-24.htm" title="And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain on the earth.">Revelation 18:24</a>) that in her was found the blood of prophets, and saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth. The cruel spirit of persecution marked old Pagan Rome. She was drunk with their blood. It is not literally true that "all the blood shed on the earth" would be found in Rome, either Pagan or Papal; but it is spiritually true. Just as all the blood from righteous Abel to Zacharias was required of Jerusalem, so also of Babylon; for the spirit is the same spirit of hatred of holiness and love of worldliness. To slay one is to slay all, as to be guilty in one point of the Law is to be guilty of all; for it is not to mere acts, but also to the spirit and drift of men's conduct, that the Scriptures look. It is the Babylon spirit, whether dominant in Rome or in London, that kills the good. Wherever the spirit of worldliness (in its widest sense) is to be found, there is the spirit at enmity with God and good, and there is the Babylon which has slain the saints.<p><span class= "bld">And when I saw her, I</span> <span class= "bld">wondered . . .</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And I wondered when I saw her with great wonder</span> (not "admiration" in our modern sense). Why did St. John wonder? Was it at the splendour or the blasphemous names? Hardly these; for he was familiar with the former in descriptions of Babylon given by the prophets, and with the latter from his own vision in Revelation 13. The wonder probably rose from the strange alliance of the woman with the wild beast. It was not wonderful to see the vision of a wild beast or monster dealing out death and slaughter, but to see a woman allied with the monster and drunken with the blood of the holy provoked astonishment. The woman, too, was a harlot. The prophets had spoken of Israel and Judah as harlots, where they had allied themselves with the world and its dark idolatries (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm" title="How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm" title="For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will not transgress; when on every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-15.htm" title="But you did trust in your own beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and poured out your fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.">Ezekiel 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm" title="For their mother has played the harlot: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.">Hosea 2:5</a>). Did he read in the form of the vision the hint that in the lapse of years the Church of Christ, like Israel of old, might fall from her high calling and become the ally of the world-power? The hint of it slumbered in the vision.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Wherefore didst thou wonder?</span> The angel explains the mystery or hidden meaning. In doing so he identifies the wild beast which carries the woman with the wild beast of Revelation 13. In that chapter the wild beast was seen wounded to death; the same thought is expressed in this chapter. <span class= "ital">The wild beast was and is not</span> It has received its death wound: the dying and risen Lord has given the death-blow to the world-power, as He has cast down Satan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm" title="And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.">Revelation 12:9</a>), put limits to his power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm" title="And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,">Revelation 20:2</a>), and destroyed him that had the power of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>). In the victory of Christ the wild beast <span class= "ital">that was </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that had in successive ages been seen in the great world-powers) is slain, or, as the angel expresses it, <span class= "ital">is</span> <span class= "ital">not.</span> But though he is not, though he is to be reckoned as doomed, yet he will show signs of vitality: he will rise into temporary power. <span class= "ital">He shall come up out of the abyss.</span> But the march of his power is only a march to the grave. He <span class= "ital">goes to destruction.</span> Yet this transient revival and apparent recovery from its death-wound will be viewed (as was said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-3.htm" title="And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.">Revelation 13:3</a> : "all the earth wondered after the wild beast") as a marvel by those whose [??] are not heaven-taught, and whose minds are set upon earthly things. <span class= "ital">They that dwell upon the earth shall wonder, whose name is not written on the book of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the wild beast that he was, and is not, and shall be present </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>shall come again).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And upon her forehead was a name written.</span> Omit "was." <span class="greek">&#x1f4c;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "name," is dependent upon <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "having," in ver. 4. This practice was customary with harlots (Juv., 'Sat.,' 6:123; Seneca, 'Controv.,' 1:2). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a> and Revelation 7:3 the faithful members of God's Church have his Name in their foreheads; here the faithless ones, represented by the harlot, exhibit a spurious imitation. As God's Name marked the former as his, so the name Babylon, etc., marks the latter as belonging to the world (see on Revelation 16:19; 17:5; 18:2). The <span class="accented">name</span> consists of the words following, to the end of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</span> The word "MYSTERY" may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> part of the name, standing coordinately with "BABYLON" (Alford, Bleek, Hengstenberg, Vitringa, Wordsworth); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a description of the following title, being thus in apposition with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "name" (Auberlin, De Wette, Dusterdieck, Ebrard); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> an adverb used in the same sense as in the last case (Stuart). Whichever view be taken, there can be no doubt that the purpose is to draw attention to the fact which is contained in the following words - a fact which might otherwise be exceedingly difficult to receive. For the rest of the verso asserts that the harlot is Babylon; that is, that the worldly portion of the Church, though nominally Christian, is in reality identical with the world, which is openly antagonistic to God. Indeed, the latter portion of the verse goes even further than this. This faithless (though outwardly Christian) portion of Christ's Church is the <span class="accented">mother</span>, that is, the cause of the existence of unfaithfulness to God. So true is it that the professing Christian who is worldly minded does more to cause in others disobedience and unfaithfulness to God, than he who openly declares himself in opposition to God, and even persecutes the faithful; cf. the words to the Church in Laodicea, "I would thou went cold or hot" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15</a>). (On "ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH," see on ver. 4.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 Rome clearly appears to be meant in this chapter. Pagan Rome subdued and ruled with military power, not by art and flatteries. She left the nations in general to their ancient usages and worship. But it is well known that by crafty and politic management, with all kinds of deceit of unrighteousness, papal Rome has obtained and kept her rule over kings and nations. Here were allurements of worldly honour and riches, pomp and pride, suited to sensual and worldly minds. Prosperity, pomp, and splendour, feed the pride and lusts of the human heart, but are no security against the Divine vengeance. The golden cup represents the allurements, and delusions, by which this mystical Babylon has obtained and kept her influence, and seduced others to join her abominations. She is named, from her infamous practices, a mother of harlots; training them up to idolatry and all sorts of wickedness. She filled herself with the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus. She intoxicated herself with it; and it was so pleasant to her, that she never was satisfied. We cannot but wonder at the oceans of Christian blood shed by men called Christians; yet when we consider these prophecies, these awful deeds testify to the truth of the gospel. And let all beware of a splendid, gainful, or fashionable religion. Let us avoid the mysteries of iniquity, and study diligently the great mystery of godliness, that we may learn humility and gratitude from the example of Christ. The more we seek to resemble him, the less we shall be liable to be deceived by antichrist.</body></html>
