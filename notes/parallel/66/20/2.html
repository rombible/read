This fact opposes the interpretation which makes "the thousand years" yet in the future. When, then, did this binding take place? Only one answer can be given. It was when Christ bruised the serpent's head by his act of redemption. Thus, "Christ was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>); "Now shall the prince of this world be cast out." (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>); "The prince of this world hath been judged" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>). Satan is the strong man bound (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-26.htm">Matthew 12:26, 29</a>). Next, what is meant by "for a thousand years"? The best interpretation seems to be that this phrase expresses a quality, and does not express a period of time. That such a method of employing numbers is usual in the Apocalypse we have frequently seen (see on Revelation 1:4, "seven;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, "ten," etc.). Here, therefore, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4</a>, "one thousand" signifies "completeness." Satan is bound "for a thousand years;" that is, Satan is completely bound. In Ezekiel (from which the following part of the vision is certainly derived) a similar use is made of the terms "seven years" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-9.htm">Ezekiel 39:9</a>) and "seven months" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-12.htm">Ezekiel 39:12</a>). But, again, in what sense can Satan be said to have been "completely" bound by our Lord's work of redemption? The answer is - In relation to the godly. The purpose of this sentence is that which is one great purpose of the whole book, viz. to encourage the struggling Christian. Thus this sentence assures Christians that, for them, Satan has been completely bound, and they need not despair nor fear his might (cf. "loosed," <span class="accented">infra</span>). The chapter thus describes, not a millennium of the saints, but the overthrow of Satan. Before the picture of the war and the overthrow, the saints are invited to behold the complete security of those who have not worshipped the beast nor his image; just as the vision of Christ victorious introduced the seal visions. <span class="cmt_word">And shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled;</span> <span class="accented">and shut</span> [it] and <span class="accented">sealed</span> [it] <span class="accented">over him</span>, etc. It is possible that there is here a reference to the death and burial of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-66.htm">Matthew 27:66</a>). Satan "met in reality that fate which he was able, in a shadowy and temporary form, to inflict on Jesus - he was bound and shut up in the abyss, and the abyss was sealed over him" (Milligan. Cf. also the word "abyss," <span class="accented">supra</span>). Satan was thus bound "that he might deceive the nations no more," etc.; that is, Satan, in his character of the deceiver (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>) of the world, is thus limited in his power by the binding which has been described. <span class="accented">The nations</span>; in the sense of the world, not the ungodly world. <span class="cmt_word">And after that he must be loosed a little season</span>. Omit "and." "A little time" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is the exact phrase used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>, where it certainly means the period of this world's existence. Such also is its meaning here. "He must be loosed" signifies that Satan is, in regard to the ungodly, allowed to work his will during this period. The thousand years' binding, and the loosing for a little time, describe two events which occur contemporaneously. While the godly need have no fear, because even in this world Satan's power as regards them is completely limited by Christ's act of redemption, yet in another sense, as regards the ungodly, Satan is loosed and obtains power over them. The chief difficulty in this interpretation lies in the words, "after this." But it must be remembered that the "thousand years" do not express a period of time, but the quality of completeness. Therefore the loosing of Satan must not be supposed to take place in a period subsequent to the period of the binding. The seer wishes to describe the devil in a twofold character, subordinating the second to the first. He thus says, "By Christ's redeeming work Satan is bound and fettered in regard to you faithful Christians; but there is also a second subordinate fact to remember, that at the same time he is powerful in his natural sphere, among his own adherents." The binding of Satan in one direction being immediately followed by a display of power in another, and the former fact being expressed by the chronological symbolism of being bound for a thousand years, it is part of this chronological symbolism to express the second fact as taking place <span class="accented">after</span> the first, though a subordination of the secondary to the primary effect is really what is intended to be conveyed (see Milligan, quoted above). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-3 Here is a vision, showing by a figure the restraints laid on Satan himself. Christ, with Almighty power, will keep the devil from deceiving mankind as he has hitherto done. He never wants power and instruments to break the power of Satan. Christ shuts by his power, and seals by his authority. The church shall have a time of peace and prosperity, but all her trials are not yet over.</body></html>
