The nations deceived and led astray are designated as Gog and Magog. The names are derived from Ezekiel (Ezekiel 38, 39). In rabbinical books the names were used to describe the nations who would rise against the reign of the Messiah. The names are to be understood figuratively. No particular nation could be well spoken of as "the nations in the four corners of the earth." The origin of the figure is not difficult. In Ezekiel, Gog is called the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal; or, adopting another rendering, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. Magog is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm" title="The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.">Genesis 10:2</a> as one of the sons of Japheth. The name is there associated with Gomer, Madai, and Meshech. Gomer is thought to correspond with the Cimmerians, Madai with the Medes, and Meshech with the Muscovites. Mr. Smith, in his history of Assurbanipal from cuneiform inscriptions, thinks that a certain chief of the Saka (Scythians), named Gaagi, is the same as Gog. The sons of this Gaagi are mentioned in connection with Birighudri, a chief of Madai (Medes). Josephus also identifies Magog with the Scythians. The remembrance of the Scythian invasion lingered long in the minds of Asiatic nations; and the names of those northern nations were adopted as representative of the great and undefined enemies who would in after ages assail the Messiah's kingdom, or wage unprovoked war against the true Israel of God. Ezekiel's language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-17.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Are you he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring you against them?">Ezekiel 38:17</a> seems to imply as much. The Evangelist here accepts the names employed by the earlier prophet. Gog and Magog stand for the great hosts of the nations, and their leaders, who would break forth into uncalled-for hostility against the people of the Lord. It must be remembered that the imagery is derived from the history of Israel. Jerusalem, the beloved city of the true Israel of God, looks out upon her foes. They are Babylon, Egypt, or they may come from the far northern regions, the abode of Gog and Magog, whence the wild and relentless invaders had poured upon the land. Gog and Magog are thus used as typical names. Under the auspices of such, the great gathering of turbulent and reckless enemies of the faith would take place. The hosts of the foes of Jerusalem are described as innumerable as the sand of the sea. This great concourse of countless hosts is moved by hostility to the faith of Christ. The nations, thus multitudinous, have been restrained during the millennial reign. Evil and unbelief have been held in check, but they have not been extinguished. The millennial reign is clearly, therefore, not a period in which the rule of Christ is universally and sincerely accepted. There are powers at work which compete for human affections and interests; but the general acceptance of Christian principles keeps the evil forces in abeyance, and the gracious strength of God limits the power of the archenemy. But when the restraints are removed, the long-suppressed evil breaks forth, and the reluctantly submissive nations are gathered together to <span class= "ital">the war</span>--not to battle, as in our version, but to the war--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to the war which has been before spoken of in Revelation 16, 19. All the restraints which Christ and Christian teaching had supplied to the world are gradually removed. The Euphrates is dried, the Devil is loosed, the unclean spirits have gone forth, the last phase of the long war between good and evil, between Christ and Belial, has been entered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog;</span> <span class="accented">four corners.</span> The signification of "Gog and Magog" (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) shows in what sense "the nations" is used. It is in the limited sense of the ungodly of the world, not in the wider sense in which the expression is used (without any qualifying clause) in ver. 3. <span class="accented">Magog</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> is mentioned among the sons of Japheth who were the ancestors of the northern nations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a> and Ezekiel 39:2). Hence the name <span class="accented">Magog</span> is used to denote the northern tribes, whose invasion of Palestine and adjoining parts took place about <span class="date">B.C. 630-600</span>. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39.htm">Ezekiel 39</a>, it seems that Gog was originally a leader among these tribes; and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-17.htm">Ezekiel 38:17</a> it seems that Ezekiel took these names to be symbolical of all the foes of the people of God. Jewish tradition makes use of these names to indicate those nations who were expected to war against Jerusalem in the last days, and to be overthrown by the Messiah. Hence the employment of the terms here by St. John as denoting the ungodly people of the world, amongst whom Satan still exercises his power, though that power is limited to these, and he is completely bound as regards true believers. <span class="cmt_word">To gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea;</span> <span class="accented">to the war</span>; the article points definitely to the war of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a> and Revelation 16:14. It is a prolonged <span class="accented">war</span>, not a <span class="accented">battle</span>, because lasting throughout life. The vastness of the hosts of Gog and Magog is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-9.htm">Ezekiel 38:9, 16</a>. This is in conformity with our Lord's teaching: "Many are called, but few are chosen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-14.htm">Matthew 22:14</a>; cf. also Revelation 7:14). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:7-10 While this world lasts, Satan's power in it will not be wholly destroyed, though it may be limited and lessened. No sooner is Satan let loose, than he again begins deceiving the nations, and stirring them up to make war with the saints and servants of God. It would be well if the servants and ministers of Christ were as active and persevering in doing good, as his enemies in doing mischief. God will fight this last and decisive battle for his people, that the victory may be complete, and the glory be to himself.</body></html>
