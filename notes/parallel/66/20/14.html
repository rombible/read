We then read, not "This is the second death"--as though the reference were to what went before--but, <span class= "ital">This is the second death, the lake of fire.</span> The last verse then follows, <span class= "ital">And if any was not found written in the book</span> (or, <span class= "ital">roll</span>)<span class= "ital"> of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.</span> Thus, three times in these two short verses, like a refrain at the close of each clause, we have the terrible words "the lake of fire." Into this lake of fire Death and Hades are thrown. It is clearly figurative language, implying that Death, the last enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm" title="The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.">1Corinthians 15:26</a>) is destroyed, together with Hades, who was personified as Death's escort (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.">Revelation 6:8</a>). So we read in the next chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm" title="And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.">Revelation 21:4</a>) "there shall be no more death." The lake of fire into which Death is thrown is the second death! We have read of this before in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.">Revelation 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm" title="Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.">Revelation 20:6</a>). It is a death of which the first death--the physical death, now destroyed--was but a faint figure. It is a condition which needs no coarse exaggeration, or vulgar literalisation of the prophetic imagery, to heighten the horror of. Very awful is that spiritual death, which knows not and loves not God, and from which Christ has come to arouse us; more awful must be that second death, in which the spirit, no longer the sinning victim of hereditary evil, has become the victim of habitual choice of wrong, loving darkness rather than light, and choosing alienation rather than reconciliation--the husks of the swine rather than the Father's house. Of the full meaning of the words in their true and <span class= "ital">future force</span> we can have little conception. It is enough for us to remember two things: they are figurative, but they are figurative of <span class= "ital">something.</span><p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire;</span> <span class="accented">death and Hades</span> (see on ver. 13). <span class="accented">Lake of fire</span> (see on ver. 10). This is described in accordance with St. Paul's teaching. "The last enemy that shall be abolished is death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>, Revised Version). <span class="accented">Death and Hades</span>, though in reality abstractions, are here personified. <span class="cmt_word">This is the second death.</span> Add [even] <span class="accented">the lake of fire.</span> St. John has not used the phrase, "the first death," but he has alluded to the fact. The first death is the actual death of the body, and which is the natural result of that spiritually dead state into which, since the Fall, man is horn, and which is therefore, as it were, his normal state. In a similar manner, the first resurrection is the risen spiritual life of conversion; while the second resurrection is the resurrection of all men, and the bestowal of eternal life upon the just. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:11-15 After the events just foretold, the end will speedily come; and there is no mention of any thing else, before the appearing of Christ to judge the world. This will be the great day: the Judge, the Lord Jesus Christ, will then put on majesty and terror. The persons to be judged are the dead, small and great; young and old, low and high, poor and rich. None are so mean, but they have some talents to account for; and none so great, as to avoid having to account for them. Not only those alive at the coming of Christ, but all the dead. There is a book of remembrance both for good and bad: and the book of the sinner's conscience, though formerly secret, will then be opened. Every man will recollect all his past actions, though he had long forgotten many of them. Another book shall be opened, the book of the Scriptures, the rule of life; it represents the Lord's knowledge of his people, and his declaring their repentance, faith, and good works; showing the blessings of the new covenant. By their works men shall be justified or condemned; he will try their principles by their practices. Those justified and acquitted by the gospel, shall be justified and acquitted by the Judge, and shall enter into eternal life, having nothing more to fear from death, or hell, or wicked men; for these are all destroyed together. This is the second death; it is the final separation of sinners from God. Let it be our great concern to see whether our Bibles justify or condemn us now; for Christ will judge the secrets of all men according to the gospel. Who shall dwell with devouring flames?</body></html>
