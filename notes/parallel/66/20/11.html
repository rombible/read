It is a white throne, in token of the purity of the judgment which follows. He who sits upon it is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. It is asked, Who is He that is seated here? Throughout the book God is called "Him that sitteth upon the throne" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm" title="And he that sat was to look on like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like to an emerald.">Revelation 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm" title="And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.">Revelation 5:1</a>); but we must not understand this as excluding the Son of God, who sits with His Father on His throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a>), and who, as Son of Man, declared that He would sit upon the throne of His glory and divide "all the nations" as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31-32</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm" title="And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:">Revelation 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15-18</a>). At the face of Him who sits upon the throne the heaven and earth flee. Hengstenberg interprets this of the putting out of the way "all of the irrational creation which had been pressed into the service of sin." Gebhardt interprets it of "the <span class= "ital">destruction</span> of the whole <span class= "ital">present</span> visible <span class= "ital">world."</span> A comparison, however, of the imagery employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/6-12.htm" title="And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, see, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;">Revelation 6:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19-20</a>, should make us cautious of asserting that any great physical catastrophe is described here. Doubtless revolution must precede renewal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.">Revelation 21:1</a>); but it is never safe to ground our expectations of the nature of such changes upon language which is confessedly poetical in form. Some physical revolutions do in all probability await our earth, but the eye of the prophet looks more to the moral and spiritual regeneration of the world--more to the spiritual well-being of mankind, than to any physical changes which may synchronise with the culmination of the world's moral history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw a great white throne.</span> <span class="accented">And I saw</span>; introducing a new phase of the vision (el. ver. 1, etc.). A <span class="accented">throne</span> is seen as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>.2; it is <span class="accented">great</span>, perhaps, by comparison with those mentioned in ver. 4; <span class="accented">white</span>, because this is the colour of purity and all heavenly virtues (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.</span> The true reading, "before the throne," in the following verse makes it clear that God the Judge is here intended. Perhaps from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a> we must infer that God the Son is meant. The destruction of the world is complete - "no place is found for them;" they are annihilated. Such an event is nearly always portrayed in the description of the last judgment in the Apocalypse and in the New Testament generally (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-20.htm">Revelation 16:20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:11-15 After the events just foretold, the end will speedily come; and there is no mention of any thing else, before the appearing of Christ to judge the world. This will be the great day: the Judge, the Lord Jesus Christ, will then put on majesty and terror. The persons to be judged are the dead, small and great; young and old, low and high, poor and rich. None are so mean, but they have some talents to account for; and none so great, as to avoid having to account for them. Not only those alive at the coming of Christ, but all the dead. There is a book of remembrance both for good and bad: and the book of the sinner's conscience, though formerly secret, will then be opened. Every man will recollect all his past actions, though he had long forgotten many of them. Another book shall be opened, the book of the Scriptures, the rule of life; it represents the Lord's knowledge of his people, and his declaring their repentance, faith, and good works; showing the blessings of the new covenant. By their works men shall be justified or condemned; he will try their principles by their practices. Those justified and acquitted by the gospel, shall be justified and acquitted by the Judge, and shall enter into eternal life, having nothing more to fear from death, or hell, or wicked men; for these are all destroyed together. This is the second death; it is the final separation of sinners from God. Let it be our great concern to see whether our Bibles justify or condemn us now; for Christ will judge the secrets of all men according to the gospel. Who shall dwell with devouring flames?</body></html>
