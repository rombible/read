There is a prominence given to the <span class= "ital">thrones, </span>because the thought of the reign of the saints is uppermost in the mind of the seer. The thrones are seen, and those who sat on them. It has been asked, "By whom are the thrones occupied?" The answer is supplied in the latter part of the verse. Those who are in the latter part said to reign with Christ are clearly those who sit upon the thrones which first caught the prophet's eye; these are all the real servants of God. They appear before the seer in two great classes:--First, the martyrs who have been faithful unto death; for he speaks first of seeing <span class= "ital">the souls of those who have been beheaded</span> (strictly, "slain with the axe," but clearly the special class of beheaded martyrs is to be taken as representing all), <span class= "ital">because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God.</span> The number of the martyrs is now complete (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>); these form the first class mentioned. Secondly, those who have been faithful in life occupy these thrones. The prophet sees these, even <span class= "ital">whosoever did not worship</span> (during life) <span class= "ital">the wild beast, nor yet his image, and did not receive the mark</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-10.htm" title="He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.">Revelation 13:10</a>) <span class= "ital">on their forehead and upon their hand.</span> The triumph and sovereignty, whatever they be, are shared by all the faithful. These things are stated as constituting their privileges. They lived, whereas the rest of the dead lived not; they reigned, and judgment was given them. This last has been felt to be a difficulty. What sort of judgment is intended? The passage in Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-22.htm" title="Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.">Daniel 7:22</a>) is clearly suggestive of the present one. The phrase (judgment was given) is not there to be understood as meaning that right was done them (see Note in <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary</span> on Daniel), neither must it be so understood here. Judicial powers are given to the saints as to those who occupy thrones; "the chief power in governing" (Gebhardt) is given them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?">1Corinthians 6:2-3</a>); they reign, they judge, they live; the true and full powers of life are seen to be theirs. And is not this the case always? Who, next to Him who knows the secrets of our hearts, exercises judicial powers over men? Do not those whose lives, as we read them, rebuke our own? Truly, those who lived for God, and refused the mark of earthliness, reign and judge us in our worldliness and weakness. This is their sovereign honour here, besides the glad reign in the unseen world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.</span> This describes the position of Christians in this life. They sit upon thrones; that is, they reign with Christ. Judgment is given unto them; that is, by their conduct in the world the world is judged and condemned. St. John continually thus describes the Christian's position; and such a picture is specially applicable for his purpose here, which is to portray the glory of the Christian calling, and the certainty of the Christian's hope. The redeemed have been made kings, and reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>). So also St. Paul says we are "blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the Word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands.</span> This is a special reference to the martyrs made with the object mentioned above, viz. that of encouraging Christians in their warfare. The class here described forms part of the whole body of Christians alluded to in the first part of the verse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a>). In the same way the <span class="accented">souls</span> referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a> are those existing during the period of this world, which we have here understood to be denoted indirectly by the "thousand years." <span class="cmt_word">And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</span> "The thousand years" adopted in the Textus Receptus, is found in B and others, but omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, and others. "They lived and reigned with Christ" in complete and perfect assurance, as in ver. 2, and for the reason given in ver. 2, viz. that, Satan was bound completely. This living and reigning must not be limited to the period after the death of the martyrs (though it is doubtless true in this sense also), notwithstanding the fact that St. John sees them here after their death. It is as though he would say, "You Christians sit upon thrones and reign with Christ; yea, even those who suffered shameful deaths shared this perfect safety and exaltation, though to the eyes of the world they were so afflicted and degraded." <span class="accented">They lived</span> is described in ver. 5 as the "first resurrection." This can only be referred to that first awakening from sin to the glorious life of the gospel, which St. John elsewhere describes in a similar manner. "He that heareth my Word... hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>); "We have passed from death unto life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:4-6 Here is an account of the reign of the saints, for the same space of time as Satan is bound. Those who suffer with Christ, shall reign with him in his spiritual and heavenly kingdom, in conformity to him in his wisdom, righteousness, and holiness: this is called the first resurrection, with which none but those who serve Christ, and suffer for him, shall be favoured. The happiness of these servants of God is declared. None can be blessed but those that are holy; and all that are holy shall be blessed. We know something thing of what the first death is, and it is very awful; but we know not what this second death is. It must be much more dreadful; it is the death of the soul, eternal separation from God. May we never know what it is: those who have been made partakers of a spiritual resurrection, are saved from the power of the second death. We may expect that a thousand years will follow the destruction of the antichristian, idolatrous, persecuting powers, during which pure Christianity, in doctrine, worship, and holiness, will be made known over all the earth. By the all-powerful working of the Holy Spirit, fallen man will be new-created; and faith and holiness will as certainly prevail, as unbelief and unholiness now do. We may easily perceive what a variety of dreadful pains, diseases, and other calamities would cease, if all men were true and consistent Christians. All the evils of public and private contests would be ended, and happiness of every kind largely increased. Every man would try to lighten suffering, instead of adding to the sorrows around him. It is our duty to pray for the promised glorious days, and to do every thing in our public and private stations which can prepare for them.</body></html>
