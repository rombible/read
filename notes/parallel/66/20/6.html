The blessing on those who have part or share in the first resurrection has this definite feature. On these the second death has not power (or authority). The second death stands in contrast with the first resurrection. The second death is not the mere physical dying; it is rather that more awful death which lies outside the region of the things seen and temporal. Whatever it means, and whatever the conditions which surround it, it is spiritual rather than physical. It is not the life of the body which protects the life of the spirit; it is the living and believing in God which protects from the second death; according to Christ's word of such, "they shall never die" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-26.htm" title="And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?">John 11:26</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:">John 10:27-28</a>). Blessed, too, are such in being priests and kings (they shall reign). Theirs is the priesthood of life who have offered themselves a living sacrifice to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>). The kingship of life is theirs, who have overcome the world-powers in the word of God and in the blood of the Lamb; these truly reign. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years;</span> <span class="accented">over these the second death hath no authority.</span> The first words describe the state of those who have part in the spiritual resurrection with Christ (see on ver. 5). The second clause gives to the oppressed Christian the culminating reason for patience and perseverance. The "second death" is the spiritual death of the lake of fire (ver. 14). <span class="accented">Priests of God</span>, etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>). <span class="accented">A thousand years</span>; in complete and everlasting security (see on ver. 2, et <span class="accented">seq.</span>). We may in this place briefly indicate some of the other interpretations which have been given to this reign cf. the saints for a thousand years, or, as it is generally styled, the millennium. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The literal interpretation of a future reign on earth of Christ with his saints for a thousand years. According to this view, there is to be a first resurrection of the dead (either of the holy dead or of all the dead), then the period of a thousand years, during which Satan will be bound, and the saints will reign; then finally the ultimate punishment of Satan - the casting into the lake of fire. Some limit the locality of this reign to a particular spot on the earth (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jerusalem), beyond which live the ungodly. The objections to this theory are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Amongst its advocates almost every detail is a matter of dispute. Some place the millennium in the future, others in the past. Of these latter some specify the first thousand years of the Christian age, others the thousand years from the time of Constantine. "The length of the period, the number and class of the believers who shall be partakers of its glory, the condition in which they are to live, the work in which they are to be engaged, the relation in which the exalted Redeemer is to stand to them," are all subjects for disagreement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The carnal nature of such a resurrection is at variance with the general teaching of the Bible, and unlike the spiritual nature which our Lord himself assumed after his resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> If the saints receive a glorified body for that period, it is impossible to conceive of them as living in the world in its present state, and a large part of which is inhabited by the ungodly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> It is impossible satisfactorily to conceive what relations could exist between the saints in such a case and the ungodly. If Satan is bound during this period so that he can deceive the nations no more, whence comes the evil which exists among the ungodly portion of the world? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> There is no other example of a literal use of numbers in the whole of the Apocalypse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> The teaching of the Bible elsewhere not only negatively fails to support this view, but is in positive opposition to it, in such points as a continuance of evil after Christ's second coming; the existence of an interval between his coming and the judgment instead of a sudden coming to judgment (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>, "I will raise him up at the last day"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The spiritual interpretation, which makes the thousand years expressive of the whole Christian age. This seems to a certain extent true, since what the thousand years signifies does have its effect during this time in the reign of the saints. But it seems inexact, since it makes the thousand years symbolical of a length of time, instead of a quality attached to an action. What is meant is not that Christ bound Satan during the period of the Christian age (though, as we have seen, there is a sense in which he is so bound as regards believers), for, on the contrary, he goes about like a roaring lion; but that he bound and overthrew him completely for all Christians by his redeeming work. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:4-6 Here is an account of the reign of the saints, for the same space of time as Satan is bound. Those who suffer with Christ, shall reign with him in his spiritual and heavenly kingdom, in conformity to him in his wisdom, righteousness, and holiness: this is called the first resurrection, with which none but those who serve Christ, and suffer for him, shall be favoured. The happiness of these servants of God is declared. None can be blessed but those that are holy; and all that are holy shall be blessed. We know something thing of what the first death is, and it is very awful; but we know not what this second death is. It must be much more dreadful; it is the death of the soul, eternal separation from God. May we never know what it is: those who have been made partakers of a spiritual resurrection, are saved from the power of the second death. We may expect that a thousand years will follow the destruction of the antichristian, idolatrous, persecuting powers, during which pure Christianity, in doctrine, worship, and holiness, will be made known over all the earth. By the all-powerful working of the Holy Spirit, fallen man will be new-created; and faith and holiness will as certainly prevail, as unbelief and unholiness now do. We may easily perceive what a variety of dreadful pains, diseases, and other calamities would cease, if all men were true and consistent Christians. All the evils of public and private contests would be ended, and happiness of every kind largely increased. Every man would try to lighten suffering, instead of adding to the sorrows around him. It is our duty to pray for the promised glorious days, and to do every thing in our public and private stations which can prepare for them.</body></html>
