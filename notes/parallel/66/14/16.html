There are two gatherings described in this place: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the harvest of the earth by the Son of man; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the gathering of the vintage by the angel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the whole, it seems probable that the first refers to the selection by Christ of the faithful at the end of the world, while the secured describes the ingathering of the wicked for punishment immediately afterwards. This agrees with the general tenor of the whole chapter, viz, a portrayal of the opposite fates in store for the faithful and the wicked. The description thus corresponds with the account of the end of the world given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>, with which chapter this one has so much in common (see on the first verses of the present chapter). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. the saints are first selected and sealed, before the wicked meet their doom. Thus, also, the judgment is described by our Lord in his parables of the wheat and the tares, and the sheep and the goats. This accounts also for the first gathering being presided over by the Son of man, while the second is conducted by an angel. The punishment in connection with the vintage seems to distinguish it from the first harvest. This also corresponds to the announcements of the former angels, who first preach the everlasting gospel, and afterwards denounce those who serve the beast (vers. 6-11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:14-20 Warnings and judgments not having produced reformation, the sins of the nations are filled up, and they become ripe for judgments, represented by a harvest, an emblem which is used to signify the gathering of the righteous, when ripe for heaven, by the mercy of God. The harvest time is when the corn is ripe; when the believers are ripe for heaven, then the wheat of the earth shall be gathered into Christ's garner. And by a vintage. The enemies of Christ and his church are not destroyed, till by their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he will spare them no longer. The wine-press is the wrath of God, some terrible calamity, probably the sword, shedding the blood of the wicked. The patience of God towards sinners, is the greatest miracle in the world; but, though lasting, it will not be everlasting; and ripeness in sin is a sure proof of judgment at hand.</body></html>
