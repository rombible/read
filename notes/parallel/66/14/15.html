The sickle was put in: the earth was reaped.<p><span class= "bld">THE VINTAGE.</span><p>There must be some difference between the vintage and the harvest. There is an autumn gladness about the harvest: there are tokens of judgment in the vintage. It is not the sharp sickle alone which is required: the winepress, the winepress of God's wrath, is called into use. An angel from the Temple calls to the Son of man to reap the harvest: an angel from the altar calls to an angel from the Temple to gather in the vintage. The vintage symbolises a harvest of judgment; do not the words respecting Babylon (the wine of the wrath of her fornication, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a>) come to the mind and confirm this? The angel rises from the altar, beneath which the murdered saints had cried, "How long?" and proclaims, "The vintage, the hour of vengeance, has come!" And it is not without significance that the angel to whom this cry is addressed comes forth out of the Temple, the safe sanctuary of God's faithful ones, as one who has witnessed their secret sorrows and their sufferings, and is fitted "to recompense tribulation to the troublers of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;">2Thessalonians 1:6</a>).<p>(17) <span class= "bld">And another angel . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And another angel, . . . having himself also</span> (as well as the Son of man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14</a>) <span class= "ital">a sharp sickle.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - A<span class="cmt_word">nd another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud;</span> <span class="accented">another angel</span>; in addition to those already mentioned, not implying that he who sat on the cloud was an angel. <span class="accented">Out of the temple</span>, or <span class="accented">shrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); the inner sanctuary of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>). The angel acts as the messenger of the will of God to Christ in his capacity of Son of man, because the command is one concerning the times and seasons which the Father hath kept in his own power (Alford).

The harvest time is when the corn is ripe; when the believers are ripe for heaven, then the wheat of the earth shall be gathered into Christ's garner. And by a vintage. The enemies of Christ and his church are not destroyed, till by their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he will spare them no longer. The wine-press is the wrath of God, some terrible calamity, probably the sword, shedding the blood of the wicked. The patience of God towards sinners, is the greatest miracle in the world; but, though lasting, it will not be everlasting; and ripeness in sin is a sure proof of judgment at hand.</body></html>
