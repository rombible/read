There are to be seen the Lamb, set as King upon the holy hill of Zion, and with Him the sealed ones, His faithful soldiers and servants.

Having described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. and 13.) the trinity of enemies with which Christ and his people contend, the vision now passes on to depict the blessedness in store for the faithful Christian, and, on the other hand, the final fate of the dragon and his adherents. We are thus once more led to the final judgment. And just as in the former vision, after the assurance of the salvation of the faithful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>.), came the denunciation of woe for the ungodly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8.htm">Revelation 8-11:14</a>), leading once more to a picture of the saved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15-19</a>), so here we have the assured blessedness of the faithful portrayed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1-13</a>), followed by the judgments upon the ungodly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14 - 18:24</a>), and leading on once more to a picture of the saints in glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Zion;</span> <span class="accented">and behold, the Lamb standing on the Mount Zion</span>, as in the Revised Version.

The appropriateness of the position is seen <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in its strength (cf. the position of the beast, rising from the sea, perhaps standing on the sand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-1.htm">Psalm 87:1, 2</a>, "His foundation is in the holy mountains.

Here, as there, the hundred and forty-four thousand are those "redeemed from the earth" (ver. 3). The number denotes a large and perfect number; a multitude of which the total is complete (see on Revelation 7:4). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. the sealing in the forehead is described.

Christ is with his church, and in the midst of her in all her troubles, therefore she is not consumed. His presence secures perseverance. His people appear honourably. They have the name of God written in their foreheads; they make a bold and open profession of their faith in God and Christ, and this is followed by suitable actings. There were persons in the darkest times, who ventured and laid down their lives for the worship and truth of the gospel of Christ. They kept themselves clean from the wicked abominations of the followers of antichrist. Their hearts were right with God; and they were freely pardoned in Christ; he is glorified in them, and they in him. May it be our prayer, our endeavour, our ambition, to be found in this honourable company. Those who are really sanctified and justified are meant here, for no hypocrite, however plausible, can be accounted to be without fault before God.</body></html>
