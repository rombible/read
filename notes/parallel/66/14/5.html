They had not suffered themselves by self deceit (the second beast) to be beguiled into worship of the first beast - the world. Alford very appropriately refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1, 2</a>, "Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart." <span class="cmt_word">For they are without fault before the throne of God;</span> <span class="accented">they are without blemish.</span> The following phrase is omitted by nearly every authority. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "without blemish," reminds us of the "Lamb without blemish" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). Thus again they receive appropriate reward. While on earth they kept themselves undefiled; now they are, like the Lamb, free from blemish (see on ver. 4). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-5 Mount Sion is the gospel church. Christ is with his church, and in the midst of her in all her troubles, therefore she is not consumed. His presence secures perseverance. His people appear honourably. They have the name of God written in their foreheads; they make a bold and open profession of their faith in God and Christ, and this is followed by suitable actings. There were persons in the darkest times, who ventured and laid down their lives for the worship and truth of the gospel of Christ. They kept themselves clean from the wicked abominations of the followers of antichrist. Their hearts were right with God; and they were freely pardoned in Christ; he is glorified in them, and they in him. May it be our prayer, our endeavour, our ambition, to be found in this honourable company. Those who are really sanctified and justified are meant here, for no hypocrite, however plausible, can be accounted to be without fault before God.</body></html>
