And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came forth blood out of the winepress as far as the bridles of the horses, from a thousand six hundred furlongs</span> (stadii). The outflow of the blood of the grapes pressed reached over a distance of sixteen hundred stadii. The treading of the winepress was a figure representing vengeance; the red juice of the grape strongly suggested the shedding of blood. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/63-2.htm" title="Why are you red in your apparel, and your garments like him that treads in the winefat?">Isaiah 63:2-4</a>.) The winepresses stood usually outside the city: it is so represented here, not without an allusion to those who fall under the weight of this judgment because they have refused the defence of the true city and sanctuary. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/132-17.htm" title="There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.">Psalm 132:17-18</a>.) The distance (sixteen hundred stadii), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>four multiplied into itself and then multiplied by a hundred, is symbolical (such seems the most probable meaning) of a judgment complete and full, and reaching to all corners of the earth--"the whole world, of which Satan is called the prince, is judged, and condemned, and punished" (Dr. Currey). In the vintage and harvest is a piercing discrimination between the faithful fruit-bearing children of the King and the cowardly or selfish, whose hearts are for self and not for Christ, but who yield themselves servants to sin.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth.</span> This angel is described in quite a different manner from "him who sat on the cloud" (ver. 16). <span class="cmt_word">And cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God;</span> <span class="accented">into the wine press, the great</span> [winepress], etc. The feminine substantive has agreeing with it a masculine adjective. It is doubtful whether we ought to see in this anything more than a mere slip of grammar. Possibly the word is of either gender. It is connected with the festival of Bacchus. Wordsworth, however, accounts for the masculine form of the adjective by supposing that the writer wishes to give a stronger force to the word, and to emphasize the terrible nature of the wrath of God. We have the same image in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, and it seems derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58.htm">Isaiah 58</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>. Destruction by an enemy is alluded to as the gathering of grapes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>. The text itself explains the signification of the figure. There seems also some reference in the language to those who "drink of the wine of the wrath of her [Babylon's] fornication" (ver. 8). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:14-20 Warnings and judgments not having produced reformation, the sins of the nations are filled up, and they become ripe for judgments, represented by a harvest, an emblem which is used to signify the gathering of the righteous, when ripe for heaven, by the mercy of God. The harvest time is when the corn is ripe; when the believers are ripe for heaven, then the wheat of the earth shall be gathered into Christ's garner. And by a vintage. The enemies of Christ and his church are not destroyed, till by their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he will spare them no longer. The wine-press is the wrath of God, some terrible calamity, probably the sword, shedding the blood of the wicked. The patience of God towards sinners, is the greatest miracle in the world; but, though lasting, it will not be everlasting; and ripeness in sin is a sure proof of judgment at hand.</body></html>
