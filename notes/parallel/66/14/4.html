Diminutive from aren; a lambkin.</span><br /><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4, 5) <span class= "bld">These are they . . .</span>--The characteristics of the servants of the Lamb are given in this verse and the following. The first is <span class= "ital">purity</span>: they are virgins. The expression can hardly be limited to the unmarried, as the 144,000 represent the wide society of the choice ones of God. They are those whose hearts have been made as the hearts of little children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/18-1.htm" title="At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?">Matthew 18:1-4</a>), who have that purity of heart which Christ declared to be blessed, and which St. James declared to be the first mark of heavenly wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">James 3:17</a>). The next is <span class= "ital">implicit obedience:</span> they follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. Some, indeed, take this to be a kind of heavenly reward: they shall be the nearer companions of the Lamb. But it is better to take it as describing their complete consecration to Christ. They are those who are with Christ, who have tasted the cup that their Lord tasted, and have taken up their cross and followed Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-27.htm" title="And whoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24-26</a>). It is well to weigh these words; it is in the "wheresoever" that we may test the reality of our Christian life. Here lies the cross that Christ bids us take up. Here is the echo of Christ's words, "Whosoever forsaketh not all he hath cannot be My disciple." The third mark is <span class= "ital">separation, </span>or unworldliness: they were purchased from among men, as a firstfruit to God and to the Lamb. They were a chosen generation, a peculiar people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a>), as the Israel of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The fourth feature is <span class= "ital">utter truthfulness:</span> in their mouth no guile or no falsehood. (Comp. Psalms 14 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/32-1.htm" title="Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.">Deuteronomy 32:1-2</a>.) The verse emphatically ends with "They are blameless." The words "before the throne of God" must be omitted. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>.)<p>We have seen the servants of God; we have marked their character; we are now to see the weapon which is to be employed in the conflict against the enemies of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.</span> There is little doubt that these words are intended in a spiritual sense. In the Old Testament the employment of the figure of adultery and fornication to denote spiritual unfaithfulness is common (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-9.htm">Jeremiah 3:9</a>, etc.). St. John elsewhere in the Apocalypse makes use of the same symbolism (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>," That woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5, 6</a>). Similarly, also, St. John pictures the faithful Church as the bride adorned for her Husband the Lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7, 8</a>). So also St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>), "I espoused you as a chaste virgin to one Husband, Christ." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "virgins," is a word equally applicable to men or women. This verse, therefore, seems to describe those who are free from spiritual impurity and unfaithfulness; those who have not worshipped the beast and his image. Alford, however, thinks the words should be understood literally. <span class="cmt_word">These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.</span> These words describe the great source of the bliss of the redeemed, viz. that they are continually in the presence of Christ. This is their reward for following him on earth; but the words must not be taken as referring to the earthly course of the saints (as Bengel, De Wette, Hengstenberg, and others). <span class="cmt_word">These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">these were purchased from among men, the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.</span> Some have erroneously concluded that a reference is made to a portion of the redeemed to whom special honour is conceded; or to some who attain to glory before the rest. <span class="accented">The firstfruits</span> were the best of their kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>), selected from the rest, and consecrated to the service of God. So the redeemed are the best of their kind; they who have proved themselves faithful to God, who voluntarily separated themselves from the world, and consecrated themselves to the service of God while in the world, and who are thus afterwards separated by him and consecrated to his service forever. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-5 Mount Sion is the gospel church. Christ is with his church, and in the midst of her in all her troubles, therefore she is not consumed. His presence secures perseverance. His people appear honourably. They have the name of God written in their foreheads; they make a bold and open profession of their faith in God and Christ, and this is followed by suitable actings. There were persons in the darkest times, who ventured and laid down their lives for the worship and truth of the gospel of Christ. They kept themselves clean from the wicked abominations of the followers of antichrist. Their hearts were right with God; and they were freely pardoned in Christ; he is glorified in them, and they in him. May it be our prayer, our endeavour, our ambition, to be found in this honourable company. Those who are really sanctified and justified are meant here, for no hypocrite, however plausible, can be accounted to be without fault before God.</body></html>
