Sin, which is first embraced as a delight, becomes soon an inexorable tyrant, by an awful retribution compelling men along the routine of the evil habits which they loathe while they long for, and long for even while they loathe them: there is a destiny of unrest in all sin. "The wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest." It is well that solemn words like these should be read by the light of the most certain of all truths--the power sin has of stamping its indelible features upon the human character, and giving to habit the force of a destiny.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever.</span> Compare the wording of the passages quoted above on ver. 10, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-9.htm">Isaiah 34:9, 10</a>, "The smoke thereof shall go up forever." This statement of the eternity of punishment is also in agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-26.htm">Luke 16:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-44.htm">Mark 9:44</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</span> "No rest," in contrast with the blessed rest of the saints (ver. 13). Wordsworth says, "<span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is a stronger expression than 'those who worship the beast;' it means those whose distinguishing characteristic is that they <span class="accented">are worshipping</span> the beast, and persist in worshipping him, even to the end. This characteristic is so strongly marked that they are here represented as keeping it even after their death." (On the "mark," see on Revelation 13:16-18.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:6-13 The progress of the Reformation appears to be here set forth. The four proclamations are plain in their meaning; that all Christians may be encouraged, in the time of trial, to be faithful to their Lord. The gospel is the great means whereby men are brought to fear God, and to give glory to him. The preaching of the everlasting gospel shakes the foundations of antichrist in the world, and hastens its downfal. If any persist in being subject to the beast, and in promoting his cause, they must expect to be for ever miserable in soul and body. The believer is to venture or suffer any thing in obeying the commandments of God, and professing the faith of Jesus. May God bestow this patience upon us. Observe the description of those that are and shall be blessed: such as die in the Lord; die in the cause of Christ, in a state of union with Christ; such as are found in Christ when death comes. They rest from all sin, temptation, sorrow, and persecution; for there the wicked cease from troubling, there the weary are at rest. Their works follow them: do not go before as their title, or purchase, but follow them as proofs of their having lived and died in the Lord: the remembrance of them will be pleasant, and the reward far above all their services and sufferings. This is made sure by the testimony of the Spirit, witnessing with their spirits, and the written word.</body></html>
