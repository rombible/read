The idea of this and the following verses is to portray the certainty of coming judgment. As a preliminary to this, the gospel is proclaimed to the whole world, in accordance with our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>. The <span class="accented">gospel</span> is <span class="accented">eternal</span> in its unalterable nature (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a>), and in contrast to the power of the beast, which is set for destruction (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>). The fourfold enumeration shows the universal nature of the proclamation of the gospel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, etc.) in reference to the world. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:6-13 The progress of the Reformation appears to be here set forth. The four proclamations are plain in their meaning; that all Christians may be encouraged, in the time of trial, to be faithful to their Lord. The gospel is the great means whereby men are brought to fear God, and to give glory to him. The preaching of the everlasting gospel shakes the foundations of antichrist in the world, and hastens its downfal. If any persist in being subject to the beast, and in promoting his cause, they must expect to be for ever miserable in soul and body. The believer is to venture or suffer any thing in obeying the commandments of God, and professing the faith of Jesus. May God bestow this patience upon us. Observe the description of those that are and shall be blessed: such as die in the Lord; die in the cause of Christ, in a state of union with Christ; such as are found in Christ when death comes. They rest from all sin, temptation, sorrow, and persecution; for there the wicked cease from troubling, there the weary are at rest. Their works follow them: do not go before as their title, or purchase, but follow them as proofs of their having lived and died in the Lord: the remembrance of them will be pleasant, and the reward far above all their services and sufferings. This is made sure by the testimony of the Spirit, witnessing with their spirits, and the written word.</body></html>
