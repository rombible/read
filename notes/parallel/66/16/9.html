(On the meaning of the first clause, see on ver. 8.) This is the first mention in the vials of men blaspheming. As with Pharaoh and the Egyptians, the judgments of God, instead of awakening them to repentance, only serve to harden their hearts. This again occurs under the fifth and seventh vials. So also in the sixth trumpet, we are told, men repented not - a statement also made in the subsequent part of this verse. As before pointed out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>), the two things are identical; non repentance, continuance in the service of the dragon, is blasphemy against God; though we generally reserve the name "blasphemy" for the open avowal of infidelity to God. <span class="cmt_word">Which hath power over these plagues.</span> This is what is implied in the words of ver. 8, "it was given to it?' In this visitation men distinctly recognize the hand of God. <span class="cmt_word">And they repented not to give him glory.</span> <span class="accented">Vide supra</span>, on the "blasphemy;" and contrast with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a> - another example of the sense in which these vials are the "last plagues" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:8-11 The heart of man is so desperately wicked, that the most severe miseries never will bring any to repent, without the special grace of God. Hell itself is filled with blasphemies; and those are ignorant of the history of human nature, of the Bible, and of their own hearts, who do not know that the more men suffer, and the more plainly they see the hand of God in their sufferings, the more furiously they often rage against him. Let sinners now seek repentance from Christ, and the grace of the Holy Spirit, or they will have the anguish and horror of an unhumbled, impenitent, and desperate heart; thus adding to their guilt and misery through all eternity. Darkness is opposed to wisdom and knowledge, and forebodes the confusion and folly of the idolaters and followers of the beast. It is opposed to pleasure and joy, and signifies anguish and vexation of spirit.</body></html>
