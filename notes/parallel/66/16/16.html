It is the high table-land surrounded by hills which was the great battle-field of the Holy Land. There the fortunes of dynasties and kingdoms have been decided; there the cause of liberty has triumphed; there kings fought and fell; there Gideon and Barak were victorious; there Ahaziah and Josiah were slain. The old battle-ground becomes the symbol of the decisive struggle. It is raised in meaning: it is a type, not a locality. The war of principles, the war of morals, the war of fashion culminates in an Armageddon. The progress of the spiritual struggle in individual men must lead in the same way to a mountain of decision, where the long-wavering heart must take sides, and the set of the character be determined. "There is no waving of banners and no prancing of horses' hoofs; the warfare is spiritual, so that there is in sight neither camp nor foe." It is that conflict which emerges out of various opinions and diverse principles: "the religious tendencies of the times" are (as we have been reminded) powers marshalling themselves for the battle of Armageddon. We must not look for great and startling signs: the kingdom and the conflict of the kingdom is within and around us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/17-20.htm" title="And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:">Luke 17:20-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon;</span> or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they gathered</span>; that is, the "spirits" of ver. 14, of which this is a continuation, the same verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> being repeated. By the employment of the Hebrew term, attention is called to the symbolical nature of the name. Similar cases occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a> and elsewhere in St. John's writings (see on Revelation 9:11). The correct reading, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">Har-Magedon</span>, signifies "Mountain of Megiddo;" the Authorized Version, '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">Armageddon</span>, "City of Megiddo." <span class="accented">Mount Megiddo</span> possibly refers to Carmel, at the foot of which lay the Plain of Megiddo, which was well known to every Jew as a gathering place for hostile hosts and as the scene of many battles. It is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a> as a type of woe, on account of the overthrow and death of Josiah having taken place there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>). Ahaziah also died there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>); and there also the Canaanitish kings were overthrown (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>). The name is, therefore, indicative of battle and slaughter, and intimates the complete overthrow in store for the dragon and the kings of the earth, which is described later on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:12-16 This probably shows the destruction of the Turkish power, and of idolatry, and that a way will be made for the return of the Jews. Or, take it for Rome, as mystical Babylon, the name of Babylon being put for Rome, which was meant, but was not then to be directly named. When Rome is destroyed, her river and merchandise must suffer with her. And perhaps a way will be opened for the eastern nations to come into the church of Christ. The great dragon will collect all his forces, to make one desperate struggle before all be lost. God warns of this great trial, to engage his people to prepare for it. These will be times of great temptation; therefore Christ, by his apostle, calls on his professed servants to expect his sudden coming, and to watch that they might not be put to shame, as apostates or hypocrites. However Christians differ, as to their views of the times and seasons of events yet to be brought to pass, on this one point all are agreed, Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, will suddenly come again to judge the world. To those living near to Christ, it is an object of joyful hope and expectation, and delay is not desired by them.</body></html>
