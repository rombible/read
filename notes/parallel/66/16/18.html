The three evil spirits endeavoured to unite all powers in one grand assault, but there is no natural cohesion among those whose only bond is hatred of good. The first convulsion shakes them to pieces, and the cities of the nations fall. Every subordinate power in which the earthly element was mingled (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/2-41.htm" title="And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, for as much as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.">Daniel 2:41-44</a>) is overthrown in the earthquake, even as every tree which the "Heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-13.htm" title="But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.">Matthew 15:13</a>); and great Babylon was remembered before God, &c. The features of the overthrow of Babylon are described more fully later on (Revelation 17, 18), where the various aspects of evil in the great metropolis of the world-power are dealt with (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/18-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.">Revelation 18:1-3</a>).

The church triumphant in heaven saw it and rejoiced; the church in conflict on earth saw it and became triumphant. God remembered the great and wicked city; though for some time he seemed to have forgotten her idolatry and cruelty. All that was most secure was carried away by the ruin. Men blasphemed: the greatest judgments that can befal men, will not bring to repentance without the grace of God. To be hardened against God, by his righteous judgments, is a certain token of sure and utter destruction.</body></html>
