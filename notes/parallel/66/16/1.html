The voice is then said to come from the throne; it seems likely that the voice of the first verse is the same--the divine voice from the throne itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a great voice.</span> Characteristic of all the heavenly utterances (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7, 9</a>, etc.).

Here is a succession of terrible judgments of Providence; and there seems to be an allusion to several of the plagues of Egypt. The sins were alike, and so were the punishments. The vials refer to the seven trumpets, which represented the rise of antichrist; and the fall of the enemies of the church shall bear some resemblance to their rise. All things throughout their earth, their air, their sea, their rivers, their cities, all are condemned to ruin, all accursed for the wickedness of that people. No wonder that angels, who witness or execute the Divine vengeance on the obstinate haters of God, of Christ, and of holiness, praise his justice and truth; and adore his awful judgments, when he brings upon cruel persecutors the tortures they made his saints and prophets suffer.</body></html>
