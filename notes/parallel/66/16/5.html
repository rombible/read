The world-power and its worshippers have driven away goodness and faith, the elements of the higher life of man; they have slain the just and the righteous, who were the salt of the earth; they have rejected Christ, who is the life of men; how can they reap anything but decay and death? They slay the righteous; the death of righteousness leaves them nothing but the lifeless blood behind; they can no longer drink moral life from the good; there is but the legacy of death. "Blood of saints and prophets did they pour out; and blood didst Thou give them to drink."<p>(5) <span class= "bld">And I heard the angel of the waters . . .</span>--That is, the angel who was set over the waters, or the angel who is, on the heavenly side, representative of the waters. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus A: On the Angels.</span>) The angel acknowledges God's righteousness. <span class= "ital">Thou art righteous</span> . . . <span class= "ital">because Thou didst judge these things</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>because of the righteous law which these judgments manifested.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the angel of the waters say.</span> The angels, throughout this book, are represented as having individual offices to fulfil. Here we have a reference to the angel whose duty it is to control the rivers, just as, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>, another angel is represented as having authority over fire. This verse and the following one are anticipations of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a>, which is a commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, which latter is an elaboration of the judgments here described. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus;</span> <span class="accented">righteous art thou, which art and which wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge</span> (Revised Version). There is scarcely any authority for inserting "O Lord," or "and shalt be" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>). The angel, as having authority over the waters, and, as it were, a commission to see that they do their duty for men, acknowledges the justice of the sentence which makes them into an instrument for, and type of, man's destruction. Though there is no authority for inserting "and shalt be," the idea is, no doubt, to express the eternal nature of God. The same expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a> (Revised Version) in almost exactly parallel connection; so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17, 18</a>. <span class="accented">Thou hast judged thus</span> refers to the judgment of the third vial, possibly to all the first three, Note the marginal reading of the Revised Version (supported by Alford), which disconnects this verse from the succeeding one. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-7 We are to pray that the will of God may be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Here is a succession of terrible judgments of Providence; and there seems to be an allusion to several of the plagues of Egypt. The sins were alike, and so were the punishments. The vials refer to the seven trumpets, which represented the rise of antichrist; and the fall of the enemies of the church shall bear some resemblance to their rise. All things throughout their earth, their air, their sea, their rivers, their cities, all are condemned to ruin, all accursed for the wickedness of that people. No wonder that angels, who witness or execute the Divine vengeance on the obstinate haters of God, of Christ, and of holiness, praise his justice and truth; and adore his awful judgments, when he brings upon cruel persecutors the tortures they made his saints and prophets suffer.</body></html>
