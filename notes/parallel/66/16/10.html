The result of the principles on which it has been based begin to show themselves: first, moral disease in individuals; then a corrupt tone of national morals spreading into the higher orders of society; then the fierce pride of vaunted light which scorches. Where these are, disorganisation is not far off; evil goes out a murderer and comes home a suicide. The retribution comes home; the throne of the world-power, the very head and centre of its authority, is smitten.<p><span class= "bld">And his kingdom was full of darkness.</span>--<span class= "ital">And his kingdom was darkened.</span> We have the counterpart of the Egyptian plague (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/10-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.">Exodus 10:21-23</a>); there was a typical force in that ancient plague: the kingdom which boasted itself so full of light becomes darkened. When men shut out the higher light, the smoke of their own candles will soon obscure the whole heaven. When moral evil is linked with intellectual light, the moral evil will be found the stronger; for we cannot have a sunbeam without the sun. "Take heed," said Christ, "that the light that is in thee be not darkness." There is a light that is darkness; the progress of evil bringing about its own retribution proves this conclusively.<p>(10, 11) But even the failure of their own light does not work repentance: <span class= "ital">they gnawed their tongues from their pain.</span> Here is remorse and suffering. They are "unto themselves" (as the Book of Wisdom describes the Egyptians) "more grievous than the darkness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/17-21.htm" title="Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness.">Wisdom Of Solomon 17:21</a>); but there is no softening or humbling of themselves, no turning to God. They still love what God hates, and hate what He loves, for they blasphemed God, &c., <span class= "ital">and repented not of their works.</span> Such is the wretched state of the world-power in the day when retributive evil overtakes it--darkness, pain, and inability to repent. Is it not a picture of the ultimate state of all sin? It is not a vast world-power alone which exhibits pain and confusion like this. It is to be seen over and over again in men and nations. The power of evil comes home and robs men of their accustomed guides. They are brought into darkness and trouble; the throne where the master-power of worldliness sat is cast down; the evil passion which was the unifying power of their life is deprived of the field of its power; then follows exasperation, anger at defeat, readiness to accuse others, but no blame of self, no repentance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast.</span> Omit "angel" as before (see on ver. 8). <span class="accented">The throne of the beast.</span> That throne which had been given to him by the dragon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>), and which here typifies the centre and source of his power. While this <span class="accented">throne</span> may aptly refer to the Roman empire in St. John's time, its position varies at different times; wherever the world power is worshipped, there the beast has his throne. <span class="cmt_word">And his kingdom was full of darkness;</span> <span class="accented">was darkened.</span> Another allusion to the plagues of Egypt. The darkness is a type of the spiritual darkness which prevails among the subjects of the beast, and which they themselves frequently realize in the course of their career. The fear of the future sometimes arouses their misgivings, and then there is no light or hope in their hearts. And they gnawed their tongues for rain. The pain arising from the darkness of their minds; the misgivings as to their future (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>); or perhaps also on account of their sufferings under the former plagues, to which this is an addition. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:8-11 The heart of man is so desperately wicked, that the most severe miseries never will bring any to repent, without the special grace of God. Hell itself is filled with blasphemies; and those are ignorant of the history of human nature, of the Bible, and of their own hearts, who do not know that the more men suffer, and the more plainly they see the hand of God in their sufferings, the more furiously they often rage against him. Let sinners now seek repentance from Christ, and the grace of the Holy Spirit, or they will have the anguish and horror of an unhumbled, impenitent, and desperate heart; thus adding to their guilt and misery through all eternity. Darkness is opposed to wisdom and knowledge, and forebodes the confusion and folly of the idolaters and followers of the beast. It is opposed to pleasure and joy, and signifies anguish and vexation of spirit.</body></html>
