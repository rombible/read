But we may also call to mind the great defeat of the enemies of Israel at Beth-horon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/10-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;">Joshua 10:1-11</a>), when "the Lord cast down great stones from heaven." Such an overthrow awaits every confederacy that sets itself in array against the kingdom of the righteous King. The discomfiture and the plague works no repentance; the men blaspheme God because of the hail, <span class= "ital">for great is its plague exceedingly.</span> The proud, hard spirit which still hates the good remains: thus is sin its own worst penalty. As an illustration of this hard, unsubdued spirit, we may call to mind Capaneus, in Dante's <span class= "ital">Inferno, </span>and the words in which Virgil addresses him:--<p>"Thou art more punished, in that this thy pride<p>Lives yet unquenched; no torment save thy rage<p>Were to thy fury pain proportioned full.<p>The unrepentant state of those upon whom the vials are poured is to be contrasted with the different result of the earthquake in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm" title="And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.">Revelation 11:13</a>, when men gave glory to the God of heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent</span>; <span class="accented">cometh down upon</span>, the present tense, rendering the description more graphic. Commentators usually quote 'Diodorus Siculus' (19:45), who mentions. as something marvellous, hailstones of a mina in weight; the mina being one-sixtieth of a talent; and also the account of Josephus, who speaks of stones a talent in weight being thrown by machines at the siege of Jerusalem (see Wetstein, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>). "The men," though not pointing to any particular group of men who have been definitely mentioned, nevertheless necessarily refers to the wicked, were are the object of this punishment. "Hail" is frequently mentioned as a judgment of God and is added here to heighten the general effect of the description (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9.htm">Exodus 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-17.htm">Haggai 2:17</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great;</span> <span class="accented">is exceeding great</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). As in ver. 9, men repent not. Like Pharaoh, their hearts are hardened. These words end the general description of the vial judgments, but the events alludes to under the seventh vial are elaborated and particularized in the chapters which follow; the whole concluding at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:17-21 The seventh and last angel poured forth his vial, and the downfal of Babylon was finished. The church triumphant in heaven saw it and rejoiced; the church in conflict on earth saw it and became triumphant. God remembered the great and wicked city; though for some time he seemed to have forgotten her idolatry and cruelty. All that was most secure was carried away by the ruin. Men blasphemed: the greatest judgments that can befal men, will not bring to repentance without the grace of God. To be hardened against God, by his righteous judgments, is a certain token of sure and utter destruction.</body></html>
