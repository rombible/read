This title is only mentioned here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>, where, however, some repented. (On the word "blaspheme," see on ver. 9.) In spite, therefore, of their plagues, and perhaps as a consequence of their spiritual darkness, they still own the supremacy of the beast and deny God; just as Pharaoh hardened his heart. Compare the previous verses for an account of their <span class="accented">pains and their sores</span>; the allusion to which shows plainly that these plagues are not necessarily consecutive in time. <span class="cmt_word">And repented not of their deeds</span> (see on ver. 9). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:8-11 The heart of man is so desperately wicked, that the most severe miseries never will bring any to repent, without the special grace of God. Hell itself is filled with blasphemies; and those are ignorant of the history of human nature, of the Bible, and of their own hearts, who do not know that the more men suffer, and the more plainly they see the hand of God in their sufferings, the more furiously they often rage against him. Let sinners now seek repentance from Christ, and the grace of the Holy Spirit, or they will have the anguish and horror of an unhumbled, impenitent, and desperate heart; thus adding to their guilt and misery through all eternity. Darkness is opposed to wisdom and knowledge, and forebodes the confusion and folly of the idolaters and followers of the beast. It is opposed to pleasure and joy, and signifies anguish and vexation of spirit.</body></html>
