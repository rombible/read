The angel which receives the command departs and pours forth his vial upon the earth. All the vials are poured forth "into the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-1.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God on the earth.">Revelation 16:1</a>) generally; the first angel pours his vial forth upon the earth, that is, the dry land. <span class= "ital">And there came an evil and painful sore upon the men </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>upon that part of the human race) <span class= "ital">who, </span>&c. The plague falls on those who carry the mark of the beast, and who worship it. Like the plagues of Egypt, <span class= "ital">they</span> are directed against those who aid the oppressor. The plague here described resembles the sixth of the Egyptian plagues, the plague of boils (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/9-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.">Exodus 9:8-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm" title="The LORD will smite you with the botch of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>). Egypt is one type of the world-power; and the plagues are used as types also, and are not to be understood literally. The plague of the "evil sore" denotes some throbbing and hateful sore, perhaps spiritual or mental, which distracts attention and disturbs the personal serenity and self-complacency of the worshippers of the world-power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;</span> <span class="accented">his bowl into</span>, etc. (Revised Version). (On "vial," see on Revelation 5:8.) The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, "into," distinguishes the first three vials from the last four, which have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "upon," and some writers make this the basis for classifying the vials into groups of three and four; but it seems better to divide into groups of four and three (see on ver. 1, and preliminary remarks on the trumpet visions). And there fell; <span class="accented">and it became</span> (Revised Version). Compare the phraseology of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-10.htm">Exodus 9:10</a>. A noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. The counterpart of the sixth plague of Egypt. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "sore," used here, is the same used in LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9.htm">Exodus 9</a>. It is impossible to say with certainty what (if any) particular judgment upon the ungodly is intended to be signified by St. John in this plague. From amongst the numerous interpretations which have been given to illustrate this passage, we may mention that of Andreas, who sees in it a reference to the "ulcer" (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of conscience. Or it may be that the writer has in contemplation that bodily disease which is the inevitable outcome of sin, and which often afflicts men in this world as the direct result of their misdoings; though, of course, it cannot always be asserted to be a consequence of a man's own personal misdoings. (On the latter part of the verse, see on Revelation 13.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-7 We are to pray that the will of God may be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Here is a succession of terrible judgments of Providence; and there seems to be an allusion to several of the plagues of Egypt. The sins were alike, and so were the punishments. The vials refer to the seven trumpets, which represented the rise of antichrist; and the fall of the enemies of the church shall bear some resemblance to their rise. All things throughout their earth, their air, their sea, their rivers, their cities, all are condemned to ruin, all accursed for the wickedness of that people. No wonder that angels, who witness or execute the Divine vengeance on the obstinate haters of God, of Christ, and of holiness, praise his justice and truth; and adore his awful judgments, when he brings upon cruel persecutors the tortures they made his saints and prophets suffer.</body></html>
