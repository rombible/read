And men </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>those who were worshippers of the wild beast) <span class= "ital">were scorched</span> . . . <span class= "ital">and did not repent to give him glory.</span> The sun, the great source of light and warmth, whose beams call forth the flowers of the earth, becomes a power to blast, not to bless. This is another example of the way in which the things full of beneficence are turned into powers of sorrow to those who follow evil. Not only the pleasant gifts and influences, which, like streams, were made to gladden men, grow corrupt, but the very source of light and knowledge becomes a power to destroy. We may contrast this influence of the sun with the beneficent beams of the Sun of Righteousness. Christ rose as the light and sun upon the world, because He diffused the knowledge which gave life to men; but here we have a light and sun which scorches. There is a knowledge which withers while it illumines; there is a teaching which does not warm the heart, but dries both heart and conscience, and brings but pain. The result, painful as it is, does not work repentance. Suffering, without grace and humility, does not bless men; they grow angry; the fire hardens instead of purifying. The whole series of these judgments illustrate the awful truth that there is a stage in personal life, and in national and world life also, in which suffering loses its remedial force, because the character has become set, and even an occasional desire after higher things is no longer felt.<p>"When we in our viciousness<p>Grow hard, the wise gods seal our eyes,<p>In our own slime drop our clear judgments,<p>Make us adore our errors, and thus<p>We strut to our destruction."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "angel," is omitted in nearly all manuscripts, though, of course, it is understood. For the first time we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "upon," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. "into" (see on ver. 2). Another part of creation is visited, thus completing the visitation of the fourfold division of the universe - the earth, the sea, the rivers, the heavens - as foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And power was given unto him to scorch men with fire</span>. "And it was given to it" is more probable than "to him;" the angels do not directly punish, but indirectly by pouring out the vials. This form of words expresses the permissory nature of the evil which is wrought; nothing can be done but by the will of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5, 7, 14</a>). Bengel, Hengstenberg, and others consider that the permission to scorch men is given to the angel. <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">men</span> (with the article); perhaps referring to those mentioned in ver. 2. who had the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped his image, and who are the object of all the vial plagues. Though differing in form from the fourth trumpet, where the sun was darkened, yet the judgment is similar, though here of a more intense nature. In both cases, those objects which are given to men for their good are converted into instruments of punishment. We may, perhaps, see here an allusion to the heat of men's passions and vices, by which physically as well as morally they are destroyed; and which are also an emblem of the pains of hell as pictured in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16.htm">Luke 16</a>. It has been noticed as a coincidence that the objects of creation which are the subjects of the judgments of the fourth trumpet and fourth vial, were created on the fourth day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:8-11 The heart of man is so desperately wicked, that the most severe miseries never will bring any to repent, without the special grace of God. Hell itself is filled with blasphemies; and those are ignorant of the history of human nature, of the Bible, and of their own hearts, who do not know that the more men suffer, and the more plainly they see the hand of God in their sufferings, the more furiously they often rage against him. Let sinners now seek repentance from Christ, and the grace of the Holy Spirit, or they will have the anguish and horror of an unhumbled, impenitent, and desperate heart; thus adding to their guilt and misery through all eternity. Darkness is opposed to wisdom and knowledge, and forebodes the confusion and folly of the idolaters and followers of the beast. It is opposed to pleasure and joy, and signifies anguish and vexation of spirit.</body></html>
