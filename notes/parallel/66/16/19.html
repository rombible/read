These are the only passages in the Apocalypse where this title is found; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>, "great" is not the true reading. <span class="cmt_word">Was divided into three parts.</span> The signification of this clause is somewhat uncertain. The idea is probably that of total destruction, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>, where a similar description is applied to Jerusalem. Possibly there is a reference to the trinity of evil mentioned in ver. 13. <span class="cmt_word">And the cities of the nations fell.</span> <span class="accented">The nations</span> signifies the ungodly, who stand in the same relation to the godly as the Gentiles to God's chosen people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>, etc.). This sentence declares the fall of every lesser form of evil, together with the greater typical form symbolized by" the great city." <span class="cmt_word">And great Babylon came in remembrance before God;</span> <span class="accented">and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God</span> (Revised Ver-tion). Cf. the title of "great city" (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). Cf. also the similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-31.htm">Acts 10:31</a>. This clause, together with the following one, taken in conjunction with the preceding and succeeding verses, must be referred to the great judgment day. <span class="cmt_word">To give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</span> This is the beginning of the fulfilment of the doom predicted by the angel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>. The judgment is more elaborately described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:17-21 The seventh and last angel poured forth his vial, and the downfal of Babylon was finished. The church triumphant in heaven saw it and rejoiced; the church in conflict on earth saw it and became triumphant. God remembered the great and wicked city; though for some time he seemed to have forgotten her idolatry and cruelty. All that was most secure was carried away by the ruin. Men blasphemed: the greatest judgments that can befal men, will not bring to repentance without the grace of God. To be hardened against God, by his righteous judgments, is a certain token of sure and utter destruction.</body></html>
