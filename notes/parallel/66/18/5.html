(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-9.htm" title="But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage that reaches up to heaven.">2Chronicles 28:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-6.htm" title="And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens.">Ezra 9:6</a>.) The idea is more than that of the cry of sin reaching heaven, as in the case of Sodom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/18-20.htm" title="And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;">Genesis 18:20-21</a>); the sins themselves, many and imperial, have touched the face of heaven. God hath remembered her. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>). Sometimes the oppressed have thought that God had forgotten the voice of the enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/74-10.htm" title="O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme your name for ever?">Psalm 74:10-23</a>); but the long-suffering of the Lord is salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8-18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</span> That is, the accumulation of sin is so great as to reach up to the heaven. Exactly the description of the judgment of Babylon given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>, "Forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies." The last part of the verse is a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 The downfal and destruction of the mystical Babylon are determined in the counsels of God. Another angel comes from heaven. This seems to be Christ himself, coming to destroy his enemies, and to shed abroad the light of his gospel through all nations. The wickedness of this Babylon was very great; she had forsaken the true God, and set up idols, and had drawn all sorts of men into spiritual adultery, and by her wealth and luxury kept them in her interest. The spiritual merchandise, by which multitudes have wickedly lived in wealth, by the sins and follies of mankind, seems principally intended. Fair warning is given to all that expect mercy from God, that they should not only come out of this Babylon, but assist in her destruction. God may have a people even in Babylon. But God's people shall be called out of Babylon, and called effectually, while those that partake with wicked men in their sins, must receive of their plagues.</body></html>
