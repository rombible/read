It is the outcry of those who call to mind, with pain, a glory that was great, but now is gone. It is not to be taken as meaning "what city has suffered as she has?" but rather is it the recollection of her former splendour--"how great she was." This lingering of the mind over delights now vanished is one subtle element of misery. So the hapless Francesca thought--<p>"There is no greater woe,<p>Than to remember days of happiness<p>Amid affliction." <span class= "ital">Inf.</span> v. 121-3.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in one hour so great riches is come to nought;</span> <span class="accented">because</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented">in one hour was made desolate that so great wealth.</span> This is given as the reason of the "Woe, woe!" of ver. 16, and is to be connected with the preceding clauses.

The kings of the earth, whom she flattered into idolatry, allowing them to be tyrannical over their subjects, while obedient to her; and the merchants, those who trafficked for her indulgences, pardons, and honours; these mourn. Babylon's friends partook her sinful pleasures and profits, but are not willing to share her plagues. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly spirit, and that sorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they do not lament for the anger of God, but for the loss of outward comforts. The magnificence and riches of the ungodly will avail them nothing, but will render the vengeance harder to be borne. The spiritual merchandise is here alluded to, when not only slaves, but the souls of men, are mentioned as articles of commerce, to the destroying the souls of millions. Nor has this been peculiar to the Roman antichrist, and only her guilt. But let prosperous traders learn, with all their gains, to get the unsearchable riches of Christ; otherwise; even in this life, they may have to mourn that riches make to themselves wings and fly away, and that all the fruits their souls lusted after, are departed from them. Death, at any rate, will soon end their commerce, and all the riches of the ungodly will be exchanged, not only for the coffin and the worm, but for the fire that cannot be quenched.</body></html>
