The merchants stand like the kings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-10.htm" title="Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is your judgment come.">Revelation 18:10</a>) afar off, because of the fear of her torment, saying, "Woe! woe! (or, alas! alas!) the great city, because in one hour so great wealth was desolated." The words of this lamentation are parallel to the lament of the kings, the only difference is characteristic--they bewail the sudden decay of the <span class= "ital">wealth.</span> On the fine linen and purple, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm" title="The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,">Revelation 18:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-19.htm" title="There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:">Luke 16:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her</span> (cf. ver. 11), <span class="cmt_word">shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment.</span> The future tense is now used (see on ver. 9); cf. ver. 10, where the same thing is related of' the kings. <span class="cmt_word">Weeping and wailing</span> (cf. ver. 9, where, however, we have <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "wail," instead of, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "mourn:" cf. also ver. 11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:9-19 The mourners had shared Babylon's sensual pleasures, and gained by her wealth and trade. The kings of the earth, whom she flattered into idolatry, allowing them to be tyrannical over their subjects, while obedient to her; and the merchants, those who trafficked for her indulgences, pardons, and honours; these mourn. Babylon's friends partook her sinful pleasures and profits, but are not willing to share her plagues. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly spirit, and that sorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they do not lament for the anger of God, but for the loss of outward comforts. The magnificence and riches of the ungodly will avail them nothing, but will render the vengeance harder to be borne. The spiritual merchandise is here alluded to, when not only slaves, but the souls of men, are mentioned as articles of commerce, to the destroying the souls of millions. Nor has this been peculiar to the Roman antichrist, and only her guilt. But let prosperous traders learn, with all their gains, to get the unsearchable riches of Christ; otherwise; even in this life, they may have to mourn that riches make to themselves wings and fly away, and that all the fruits their souls lusted after, are departed from them. Death, at any rate, will soon end their commerce, and all the riches of the ungodly will be exchanged, not only for the coffin and the worm, but for the fire that cannot be quenched.</body></html>
