Jeremiah enjoined Seraiah to bind the prophetic roll to a great stone, and cast them together into the Euphrates. The meaning of the act was explained--"Thus shall Babylon sink and shall not rise," &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/51-63.htm" title="And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of Euphrates:">Jeremiah 51:63-64</a>). The great dead mass, sinking helplessly by the law of its own weight, signified a fall past recovery. So Pharaoh and his host sank like lead in the mighty waters. It is the doom Christ foreshadowed as awaiting those who caused His children to fall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-6.htm" title="But whoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.">Matthew 18:6</a>). The mighty angel, strong to lift the ponderous stone, throws it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence (or, <span class= "ital">with a bound</span>) shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown, and shall not be found any more. At one bound, without a single resting-stage in its downward career, without chance or power of recovery, the vast world-city would fall. She who sat as a queen upon many waters, sinks as a stone in the mighty waters. She will not be found any more. The words "any more," or "no more," are repeated in these verses no less than six times, like a funeral knell over the departed greatness which is described.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a mighty angel took up a stone like a groat millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying;</span> <span class="accented">add one strong angel</span> (cf. the "mighty voice" in ver. 2; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1</a>, and elsewhere). The adjective, of course, refers to the mightiness of the deed wrought (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-61.htm">Jeremiah 51:61-64</a>, "Thou shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates; and thou shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise," etc.). The <span class="accented">sea</span> may be typical of the nations of the earth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thus with violence shall that groat city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all;</span> <span class="accented">Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down</span>, etc. (Revised Version). Alford translates "with a rush;" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is peculiar to this passage. The complete nature of this extinction is indicated by the frequency of the words, "no more at all," in vers. 21-23. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:20-24 That which is matter of rejoicing to the servants of God on earth, is matter of rejoicing to the angels in heaven. The apostles, who are honoured and daily worshipped at Rome in an idolatrous manner, will rejoice in her fall. The fall of Babylon was an act of God's justice. And because it was a final ruin, this enemy should never molest them any more; of this they were assured by a sign. Let us take warning from the things which brought others to destruction, and let us set our affections on things above, when we consider the changeable nature of earthly things.</body></html>
