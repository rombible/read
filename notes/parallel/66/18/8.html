She thought herself strong; she forgot the strength of the Almighty. Her plagues are four-fold, as though from every quarter her trouble came: "death for her scorn of the prospect of widowhood; mourning, for her inordinate revelling; famine, for her abundance;" and fire, the punishment of her fornication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm" title="And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-9.htm" title="And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profanes her father: she shall be burnt with fire.">Leviticus 21:9</a>). (Comp. the series of contrasts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/3-24.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.">Isaiah 3:24-26</a>.)<p>THE LAMENT OF THE KINGS (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/18-9.htm" title="And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall mourn her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,">Revelation 18:9-10</a>).--(Their words of lament are given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-10.htm" title="Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is your judgment come.">Revelation 18:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine.</span> This is the retribution for her boasting in ver. 7 (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>, "These two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day," etc.). Alford says, "<span class="accented">death</span>, for her scorn of the prospect of widowhood; <span class="accented">mourning</span>, for her inordinate revelling; <span class="accented">famine</span>, for her abundance" (cf. ver. 3). The description is not to be taken literally, but is typical of a sudden and overwhelming reverse, viz. that which will occur at the last judgment day (cf. the words of our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-42</a>). Some writers see here an allusion to the second, third, and fourth seals (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And she shall he utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</span> <span class="accented">Who judged her</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, and others. This is the fulfilment of the predicted punishment of the harlot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a>). The last clause replies, as it were, to the boast in ver. 7, "I sit as a queen," etc. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 The downfal and destruction of the mystical Babylon are determined in the counsels of God. Another angel comes from heaven. This seems to be Christ himself, coming to destroy his enemies, and to shed abroad the light of his gospel through all nations. The wickedness of this Babylon was very great; she had forsaken the true God, and set up idols, and had drawn all sorts of men into spiritual adultery, and by her wealth and luxury kept them in her interest. The spiritual merchandise, by which multitudes have wickedly lived in wealth, by the sins and follies of mankind, seems principally intended. Fair warning is given to all that expect mercy from God, that they should not only come out of this Babylon, but assist in her destruction. God may have a people even in Babylon. But God's people shall be called out of Babylon, and called effectually, while those that partake with wicked men in their sins, must receive of their plagues.</body></html>
