It is referred to as a perfume in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-17.htm">Proverbs 7:17</a>. <span class="accented">Amomon</span>, which is emitted in the Textus Receptus, is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, C. P, etc. It is rendered in the Revised Version by <span class="accented">"spice."</span> Its use was similar to that of <span class="accented">cinnamon.</span> Its seeds are used under the name <span class="accented">"cardamoms." <span class="cmt_word"></span>And wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat.</span> These form the fourth class (see on ver. 12; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves;</span> <span class="accented">and cattle</span>, etc. The word rendered "slaves" is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "bodies," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e. slaves.</span> At the word "horses" the nouns are again placed in the genitive (see on ver. 12). These form the fifth class (see on ver. 12). "Chariots," <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;</span>, is not the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-9.htm">Revelation 9:9</a>. It is a word probably of Gaulish origin. <span class="cmt_word">And souls of men.</span> The accusative again. Not in the ordinary acceptation of the word "souls," but rather "lives of men," as the Revised Version margin; that is, "living men." It is probable that the two expressions, "bodies" (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) and "souls of men," refer to two classes of slaves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:9-19 The mourners had shared Babylon's sensual pleasures, and gained by her wealth and trade. The kings of the earth, whom she flattered into idolatry, allowing them to be tyrannical over their subjects, while obedient to her; and the merchants, those who trafficked for her indulgences, pardons, and honours; these mourn. Babylon's friends partook her sinful pleasures and profits, but are not willing to share her plagues. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly spirit, and that sorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they do not lament for the anger of God, but for the loss of outward comforts. The magnificence and riches of the ungodly will avail them nothing, but will render the vengeance harder to be borne. The spiritual merchandise is here alluded to, when not only slaves, but the souls of men, are mentioned as articles of commerce, to the destroying the souls of millions. Nor has this been peculiar to the Roman antichrist, and only her guilt. But let prosperous traders learn, with all their gains, to get the unsearchable riches of Christ; otherwise; even in this life, they may have to mourn that riches make to themselves wings and fly away, and that all the fruits their souls lusted after, are departed from them. Death, at any rate, will soon end their commerce, and all the riches of the ungodly will be exchanged, not only for the coffin and the worm, but for the fire that cannot be quenched.</body></html>
