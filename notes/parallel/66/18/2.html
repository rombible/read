The great city of the world looks fair and glorious in their eyes, and even the godly are dazzled by her beauty; but when the light of heaven shines, her fall is seen to be inevitable, for she is seen to be hateful; her palaces are seen to be prisons, her highest wisdom little more than low cunning, her most exalted intelligence base-born, her sweetest songs discordant cries; the evil spirit, welcomed back, has come in seven-fold power; for the dry places afford no rest to those who still love sin and the pleasures of sin. The description in this verse is drawn largely from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21-22</a>; it is a picture of desolation and degradation, but it has its moral counterpart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying;</span> <span class="accented">and he cried with a strong voice, saying.</span> This "strong voice" is characteristic of the heavenly utterances (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen.</span> The event, though future, is described as past, being predetermined in the counsels of God.

The three phrases express the same idea, viz. the loathsome and hateful state to which Babylon is reduced. The language is derived from the prophets (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:39; 51:37). <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">hold</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>, "a strong place"); the natural and fitting stronghold of the devils, rather than a place to which they are involuntarily confined. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 The downfal and destruction of the mystical Babylon are determined in the counsels of God. Another angel comes from heaven. This seems to be Christ himself, coming to destroy his enemies, and to shed abroad the light of his gospel through all nations. The wickedness of this Babylon was very great; she had forsaken the true God, and set up idols, and had drawn all sorts of men into spiritual adultery, and by her wealth and luxury kept them in her interest. The spiritual merchandise, by which multitudes have wickedly lived in wealth, by the sins and follies of mankind, seems principally intended. Fair warning is given to all that expect mercy from God, that they should not only come out of this Babylon, but assist in her destruction. God may have a people even in Babylon. But God's people shall be called out of Babylon, and called effectually, while those that partake with wicked men in their sins, must receive of their plagues.</body></html>
