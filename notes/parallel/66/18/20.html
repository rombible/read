All saintly souls, whose affections have been towards righteousness and the righteous King, can rejoice; for the wealth of holiness is imperishable. and the fall of Babylon is the removal of one vast hindrance to holiness. It has been argued that the verse represents the Apostles to be in heaven, and from this it has been inferred that the twelve must have all died before the Apocalypse was written, and, if so, St. John was not the writer. The verse, however, has no reference whatever to the question: it is not meant to state who have passed into heaven and who have not: it is simply a summons to all who have fought on the side of their Lord to rejoice at the removal of one of the great obstacles to the manifestation of Christ's kingdom. Thus do all holy men, whether on earth or heaven, joy when any giant evil is swept away.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice over her, thou heaven.</span> These words are best understood as being uttered by the writer, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a> (see on Revelation 12:10). <span class="cmt_word">And ye holy apostles and prophets;</span> <span class="accented">and ye saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets</span>, is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, P, etc., and adopted by the Revisers. The Authorized Version reading is found in C, 1, 17. Not only the heavenly inhabitants are to rejoice, but also those on earth who have been persecuted by her, as mentioned in ver. 24. The time is again described which has been already referred to in former parts of the book, and especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>. Some authors have held this verse to prove that the writer of the Apocalypse was not the <span class="accented">Apostle</span> John; either because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> he speaks as if he were not an <span class="accented">apostle</span>, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because they assume that all the <span class="accented">apostles</span> are here referred to, and that they are in heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no ground for either presumption: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> A rhapsodical utterance of this nature cannot be interpreted literally; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the word "apostles" cannot be limited to the twelve; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as Dusterdieck justly observes, one might as well argue that the writer was not <span class="accented">a prophet.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By the "prophets "are primarily intended, perhaps, the Christian prophets (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>); but if Babylon is typical of the hostile world power, and the harlot of the faithless, worldly portion of God's Church, as we have seen them to be, the words are applicable to the Church of God in all ages. <span class="cmt_word">For God hath avenged you on her;</span> <span class="accented">for God hath judged your judgment on her.</span> The answer to the prayer of the martyrs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>. The words, "your judgment," probably mean "that judgment which is her due for her treatment of you," as in the Authorized Version. Hengstenberg gives "the doom which she pronounced upon you." Wordsworth, laying stress upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, "out of," makes the words mean, "He has taken your cause out of her hands into his own." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:20-24 That which is matter of rejoicing to the servants of God on earth, is matter of rejoicing to the angels in heaven. The apostles, who are honoured and daily worshipped at Rome in an idolatrous manner, will rejoice in her fall. The fall of Babylon was an act of God's justice. And because it was a final ruin, this enemy should never molest them any more; of this they were assured by a sign. Let us take warning from the things which brought others to destruction, and let us set our affections on things above, when we consider the changeable nature of earthly things.</body></html>
