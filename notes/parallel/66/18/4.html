It is not necessary to say whose voice it is; that it is a voice of divine love giving warning is enough. The coming forth is not to be understood of a bodily exodus from Rome. It is rather the warning which is so needful in every corrupt state of society, to have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; to practise that separation from the spirit of the world which is essential lest we should be entangled in the meshes of its sinful habits. This duty of separation may sometimes lead to a literal exodus, and even under the pressure of overwhelming necessity to secession from a world-corrupted church; but the jeopardy lies in attachment to the world-spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.">1John 2:15</a>). The parallel warnings in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-6.htm" title="Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.">Jeremiah 51:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-45.htm" title="My people, go you out of the middle of her, and deliver you every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.">Jeremiah 51:45</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/2-6.htm" title="Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, said the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, said the LORD.">Zechariah 2:6-7</a>, should be read; but the story of Lot in Sodom best illustrates the spirit of the passage (Genesis 19), for it is participation in sin which is to be primarily guarded against.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying.</span> Probably the voice of another angel in succession to the one mentioned in ver. 1. Another angel takes up the theme, because the message is now directly addressed to Christians. <span class="cmt_word">Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</span> The angel says, "my people," because he is representing God. These words, resembling <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52.htm">Isaiah 52</a>:l; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>; and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a> (cf. also ver. 8), 45, recall also the warning of our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-16.htm">Matthew 24:16</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>, "I cannot do anything till thou be come thither"). Since the harlot, who is identical with Babylon, is representative of the faithless part of the Church of God, these words form a direct warning to Christians. The departure which is commanded is not necessarily a literal, visible one; but the command implies a dissociation from, and condemnation of, the works of Babylon. Lot's wife literally departed from Sodom, but was overtaken with punishment, because her heart was not dissevered from the wickedness of the city. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 The downfal and destruction of the mystical Babylon are determined in the counsels of God. Another angel comes from heaven. This seems to be Christ himself, coming to destroy his enemies, and to shed abroad the light of his gospel through all nations. The wickedness of this Babylon was very great; she had forsaken the true God, and set up idols, and had drawn all sorts of men into spiritual adultery, and by her wealth and luxury kept them in her interest. The spiritual merchandise, by which multitudes have wickedly lived in wealth, by the sins and follies of mankind, seems principally intended. Fair warning is given to all that expect mercy from God, that they should not only come out of this Babylon, but assist in her destruction. God may have a people even in Babylon. But God's people shall be called out of Babylon, and called effectually, while those that partake with wicked men in their sins, must receive of their plagues.</body></html>
