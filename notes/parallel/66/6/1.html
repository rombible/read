They are found in some MSS. and omitted in others: the authority for their omission and for their retention is about equally divided. Under these circumstances we may fairly be guided by the context. To whom is the summons addressed? Who is bidden to come? If it was taken to be addressed to the seer, we can understand why some copyist should add the words "and see." But are they addressed to the seer? It seems difficult to see the purpose of such a command. He was near already. He had seen the Lamb opening the seal. There was no object in his drawing near. Are the words, then, addressed, as Alford supposes, to Christ? It is difficult to believe that the living creature would thus cry to the Lamb, who was opening the scroll. The simplest way of answering the question is to ask another: Who did come in obedience to the voice? There is but one answer--the horseman. The living beings cry "Come," and their cry is responded to by the appearance of the several riders. What is the spiritual meaning of this? The living beings represent, as we have seen, animated nature--that nature and creation of God which groans and travails in pain, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. These summon the emblems of war and pestilence to come on the scene, for these things must needs be, and through these lies the way for the final coming of God's Christ, for whom creation longs. They bid the pains and troubles come, because they recognise them as the precursors of creation's true King. Thus their voice has in it an undertone which sighs for the advent of the Prince of Peace, who is <span class= "ital">to come.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw</span>. A new departure in the series of visions is marked (see on Revelation 4:1). We have here the commencement of the Revelation proper, to which the first five chapters have formed an introduction (cf. Tabular analysis). The vision of the <span class="accented">seals</span>, which, although related first, exhibits events concurrent with those symbolized by the <span class="accented">trumpets</span> and <span class="accented">vials</span>, is contained chiefly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a> is occupied with an account of an episodal character, similar to that which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-11:14</a> after the sixth trumpet; and the vision is completed by the opening of the seventh seal, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-1.htm">Revelation 8:1</a>. The opening of the first seal pictures the triumph of Christ and his Church, for the comfort and hopeful assurance of those to whom St. John was writing, and for the edification of struggling Christians of all time. To this theme, touched upon here proleptically, the apostle returns at the conclusion of the <span class="accented">trumpets</span>; the first six of which bear a general likeness to the last six of the <span class="accented">seals.<span class="cmt_word"></span> When the Lamb opened one of the seals;</span> <span class="accented">one of the seven seals</span> (Revised Version). The insertion of "seven" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>) is supported by A, B, C, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, and others; Vulgate, De Dieu's Syriac, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius, Victorinus, AEthiopic. (On the <span class="accented">right</span> of the Lamb to open the <span class="accented">seals</span>, see on Revelation 5.) <span class="cmt_word">And I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts;</span> <span class="accented">the voice of thunder</span>... <span class="accented">four living creatures</span> (Revised Version). (For the <span class="accented">four living beings</span>, see on Revelation 4:6.) Here each living being invites attention to the revelation of the future of that creation of which they are all representative. The <span class="accented">thunder</span> is the usual accompaniment of a special revelation of the Divine will, and indicative of the majesty of him whose will is declared (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a> and Revelation 14:2; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>). Nothing in the text warrants us in particularizing the four living creatures in these four invitations uttered by them, though many writers have endeavoured to do so. Thus, adopting the order in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>, they have supposed that the first voice was uttered by the lion, since the revelation of the first seal is distinguished by the prophecy of victory. The sacrificial nature of the second living being - the steer - is thought to be connected with the slaughter predicted under the second seal by the vision of war and persecution. The man is considered typical of the heresy which it is believed the third seal predicts, and especially of the false opinions concerning the Incarnation; while the eagle is regarded as a symbol of resurrection and the harbinger of the final victory of the just over the death and Hades of the fourth seal. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Come and see.</span> The Revised Version omits "and see." The Textus Receptus, without any apparent authority, reads <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>, "Come and see." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Come," simply, is read in A, C, P, fourteen cursives, several versions, two manuscripts of Andreas, etc.; while <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, "Come and behold," is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, thirty-four cursives, various versions (including the Coptic), two manuscripts of Andreas, etc.; and the Syriac omits <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "Come." The authorities are thus very evenly balanced; but the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, even if not warranted, seems to indicate that the sentence was generally considered to be addressed to St. John; and was intended as an invitation to him to witness the appearances which accompanied the breaking of the seals. Alford contends that the cry, "Come," is addressed, on behalf of creation, to the Lord Jesus, and is a petition to him to speedily bring these things to pass, that his own advent may follow. In support of this, Alford remarks that there is no example of the use by St. John of <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the sense of "Come and see," "Come hither," without <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, or some qualifying particle; but, on the contrary, it is exactly the expression used of our Lord's advent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17, 20</a>, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come," etc. Though there is much reason in this contention, yet, on the whole, the weight of evidence, as stated above, makes it probable that the sentence is addressed to St. John. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Christ, the Lamb, opens the first seal: observe what appeared. A rider on a white horse. By the going forth of this white horse, a time of peace, or the early progress of the Christian religion, seems to be intended; its going forth in purity, at the time when its heavenly Founder sent his apostles to teach all nations, adding, Lo! I am with you alway, even to the end of the world. The Divine religion goes out crowned, having the Divine favour resting upon it, armed spiritually against its foes, and destined to be victorious in the end. On opening the second seal, a red horse appeared; this signifies desolating judgments. The sword of war and persecution is a dreadful judgment; it takes away peace from the earth, one of the greatest blessings; and men who should love one another, and help one another, are set upon killing one another. Such scenes also followed the pure age of early Christianity, when, neglectful of charity and the bond of peace, the Christian leaders, divided among themselves, appealed to the sword, and entangled themselves in guilt. On opening the third seal, a black horse appeared; a colour denoting mourning and woe, darkness and ignorance. He that sat on it had a yoke in his hand. Attempts were made to put a yoke of superstitious observances on the disciples. As the stream of Christianity flowed further from its pure fountain, it became more and more corrupt. During the progress of this black horse, the necessaries of life should be at excessive prices, and the more costly things should not be hurt. According to prophetic language, these articles signified that food of religious knowledge, by which the souls of men are sustained unto everlasting life; such we are invited to buy, Isa 55:1. But when the dark clouds of ignorance and superstition, denoted by the black horse, spread over the Christian world, the knowledge and practice of true religion became scarce. When a people loathe their spiritual food, God may justly deprive them of their daily bread. The famine of bread is a terrible judgment; but the famine of the word is more so. Upon opening the fourth seal, another horse appeared, of a pale colour. The rider was Death, the king of terrors. The attendants, or followers of this king of terrors, hell, a state of eternal misery to all who die in their sins; and in times of general destruction, multitudes go down unprepared into the pit. The period of the fourth seal is one of great slaughter and devastation, destroying whatever may tend to make life happy, making ravages on the spiritual lives of men. Thus the mystery of iniquity was completed, and its power extended both over the lives and consciences of men. The exact times of these four seals cannot be ascertained, for the changes were gradual. God gave them power, that is, those instruments of his anger, or those judgments: all public calamities are at his command; they only go forth when God sends them, and no further than he permits.</body></html>
