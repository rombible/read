They are robes of righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm" title="And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.">Revelation 19:8</a>); they are robes of honour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>), for those who wear them are like God, seeing Him as He is, reflecting His image; they are acknowledged to be His, as they have acknowledged Him to be their God. Persecuted on earth, they are honoured in heaven. There is also a sense in which a white robe is given to them in the eyes of men: those whose names have been cast out as evil have been honoured by a repentant posterity with the robe of tardy praise; after-generations garnish the sepulchres of the righteous whom their fathers slew. The excommunicated in one age are often the canonised of the next, for the dull world learns slowly, and its purest honours are posthumous. But however this may be, for the suffering saints there is the heavenly robe and the heavenly rest.<p><span class= "bld">It was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow- servants also and their brethren, that should be killed </span>(better, <span class= "ital">who are to be slain)</span> <span class= "bld">as they were, should be fulfilled </span>(or, <span class= "ital">shall have fulfilled their course).</span>--They are to "rest." This does not mean that they are to cease their cry for vengeance, for the saints have never cried for this; but they are to rest, as the souls of the faithful after they are delivered from the burden of the flesh, in joy and felicity. But this rest is yet a waiting for a little while till fellow-servants and fellow-sufferers have achieved their work also. To every disciple a work is given in service and suffering, and till these have borne their witness and fulfilled their course (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7-8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-25.htm" title="And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think you that I am?

The vision has recalled the past sufferings of the martyrs and their present expectation of the final consummation of their hopes, which is to be not yet. The other side is now to be shown; though they have not yet reached their final bliss, they have received the <span class="accented">white robe</span>, they are free from possibility of defilement, the victory is won, and they have <span class="accented">rest.</span> Comfort and encouragement are thus afforded to those still struggling in the world, who have not as yet attained to the white robe of perfect righteousness. And it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>. seems to determine the exact signification <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, viz. "rest in peace," "rest from their labours," rather than specifically "cease from uttering this cry" (ver. 10), as explained by De Wette and others. <span class="accented">For a little time</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); that is, till the second coming of Christ, for the time which is to intervene before that event is frequently spoken of as a <span class="accented">little time</span> (see on Revelation 1:1; 20:3; 12:12; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6, 7</a>, "Yet once a little time, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, the sea and the dry land, and all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come"). The time of the world is <span class="accented">little</span> in comparison with eternity. This <span class="accented">little time</span> is depicted and set forth under the six seals; it comes to an end at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>, and merges into eternity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-1.htm">Revelation 8:1</a>. Some expositors (of the historical school) understand a <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to be a definite, arbitrary number; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Bengel considers it to be 1111 1/9 years (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' p. 485). <span class="cmt_word">Until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</span> R, B, P, read <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "shall have fulfilled" [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> their course]; A, C, read <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "should be completed." "Their fellow servants also and their brethren" may not denote two separate bodies, notwithstanding that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> occurs twice, but, as Alford remarks, it may point out the same persons viewed in two aspects - first, the Christians needed to proceed with and finish Christ's work as his servants; second, the same ones needed to complete the number of his family. But it seems more likely that reference is intended to two classes of Christians - first, <span class="accented">their fellow servants</span>, that is, all Christians, who may, however, not suffer martyrdom; and, second, <span class="accented">their brethren</span>, the martyrs, who, like them, should yet be killed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:9-11 The sight the apostle beheld at the opening the fifth seal was very affecting. He saw the souls of the martyrs under the altar; at the foot of the altar in heaven, at the feet of Christ. Persecutors can only kill the body; after that there is no more they can do; the soul lives. God has provided a good place in the better world, for those who are faithful unto death. It is not their own death, but the sacrifice of Christ, that gives them entrance into heaven. The cause in which they suffered, was for the word of God; the best any man can lay down his life for; faith in God's word, and the unshaken confession of that faith. They commit their cause to Him to whom vengeance belongs. The Lord is the comforter of his afflicted servants, and precious is their blood in his sight. As the measure of the sin of persecutors is filling up, so is the number of the persecuted, martyred servants of Christ. When this is fulfilled, God will send tribulation to those who trouble them, and unbroken happiness and rest to those that are troubled.</body></html>
