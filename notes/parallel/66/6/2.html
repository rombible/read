All commentators seem to be agreed that this rider represents victory. The emblems --the crown and white horse--are obviously those of victory. The crown <span class= "ital">(stephanos)</span> is the crown of triumph. The horses used in Roman triumphs were white. On the white horse of triumph the crowned rider goes forth conquering, and that he might conquer. But who or what is here represented? Some take it to be a mere emblem of conquest, or victory, as the next rider represents war. There is then a harmony of interpretation: the horsemen reveal to the seer that the after-history will be marked by conquests, wars, famines, pestilences. The description, however, seems to demand something more: the expression, "that he might conquer," carries our thoughts beyond a mere transient conqueror. The vision, moreover, was surely designed to convey an assured happy feeling to the mind of the seer. No picture of mere Roman conquests or world-victory would have conveyed this. Is not the vision the reflex of the hopes of early Christian thought? It is the symbol of Christian victory. It was thus their hopes saw Christ: though ascended He went forth in spiritual power conquering. They were right in their faith, and wrong in their expectation. Right in their faith: He went forth conquering, and He would conquer. Wrong in their expectation: the visions of war, famine, death must intervene. It was through these that the conqueror would be proved more than conqueror. It is, perhaps, significant of this intervening period of trouble and suffering that the rider is armed with a <span class= "ital">bow.</span> The arrows of His judgments (war, famine) would be sharp among those who refused the sword of His word. For those who will not turn He hath bent His bow and made it ready. His arrows are ordained against the persecutors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw.</span> The usual introduction to a new vision, or a special feature of a vision (see on Revelation 4:1). <span class="cmt_word">And behold a white horse.</span> The whole vision appears to be founded on that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-12</a>. <span class="accented">White</span> is always typical in the Revelation of heavenly things (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>, "His hairs were white;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>, "a white stone;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>, and Revelation 7:9, 13, "white garments;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>, "white cloud;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11, 14</a>, "white horses;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>, "white throne"), and indeed in the whole of the New Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>), the only exceptions being <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-36.htm">Matthew 5:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>. The <span class="accented">horse</span>, throughout the Old Testament, is emblematic of war. Among the Romans a <span class="accented">white horse</span> was the symbol of victory. <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat on him.</span> On a consideration of the whole of the visions attending the opening of the seals, it seems best to interpret this vision as a symbolic representation of the abstract idea of the Church as a victorious body. In a similar way the following appearances are typical of war, famine, and death. Some interpret the rider to mean Christ himself a sense not materially different from that given above, since by the victory of Christ the Church collectively and Christians individually are enabled to triumph; and in his body, the Church, Christ triumphs. This appearance is repeated, with additions, at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>. The revelation thus begins and closes with an assurance of victory. God's end is attained in a mysterious way. Many trials and afflictions are to trouble the earth, but through all God is working to bring his Church triumphantly through the struggle. And what is true of the Church as a whole is true of each individual soul. Those to whom St. John wrote could not understand, as many now do not understand, for what purpose God permitted them to suffer. For such St. John's message is intended to be a support; not, indeed, by removing present troubles, but by declaring the final victory of those who endure to the end. Thus, then, as a preparation for the woes to be revealed, and as an encouragement after disclosing the prospect of prolonged trial, the vision of the Church triumphant is vouchsafed, both at the beginning and the end of the Revelation. Bisping and others understand the vision ass personification of war; Bengel and Reuss consider that it means conquest, or a particular conqueror (Vespasian and Trajan being denominated), just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a> and Jeremiah 32:36 the King of Babylon is connected with war, famine, and pestilence. Elliott, with others, interpret the rider as meaning the Roman empire, just as the ram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3</a>) signified the Persian, and the goat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-5.htm">Daniel 8:5</a>) the Grecian empires. Todd sees in this appearance a particular aspect of Christ's second coming. Victorinus, following <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a> in his exposition of the <span class="accented">seals</span>, sees in the first <span class="accented">seal</span> the Word of the Lord, which is like an arrow (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). Andreas sees in the first <span class="accented">seal</span> a vision of the Church's triumph over Satan in apostolic times; and similarly, in the second, the martyrdom of Christians in the age immediately following. Bode believes the <span class="accented">seals</span> to foreshadow the future history of the Church. Wordsworth, after St. Augustine, expounds the first <span class="accented">seal</span> as the advent of Christ and the Gospel, and the following ones as depicting subsequent troubles of the Church, which are specified. <span class="cmt_word">Had a bow.</span> The <span class="accented">bow</span> and arrows are used as signs of power by Old Testament writers. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a> we have, "When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8, 9</a>, "Thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation; thy bow was made quite naked;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>, "Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies." The general idea of the vision is perhaps taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7-12</a> and 6. <span class="cmt_word">And a crown was given unto him,</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>, quoted above, we have a parallel passage, "Make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the Man whose name is The Branch." The <span class="accented">crown</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> - the crown of life, the crown of victory. <span class="cmt_word">And he went forth conquering, and to conquer;</span> <span class="accented">came forth conquering, and that he may conquer.</span> This is the key to the whole vision. Only of Christ and his kingdom can it be said that it is to conquer. All earthly empires are more or less temporary in character; only of Christ's kingdom shall there be no end. A strife there must be between the powers of earth and the powers of heaven; the gospel did not inaugurate a reign of earthly peace, but the end is not doubtful; Christ and his Church <span class="accented">came forth conquering, and that</span> they <span class="accented">may conquer</span> finally, whatever earthly trials may intervene. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Christ, the Lamb, opens the first seal: observe what appeared. A rider on a white horse. By the going forth of this white horse, a time of peace, or the early progress of the Christian religion, seems to be intended; its going forth in purity, at the time when its heavenly Founder sent his apostles to teach all nations, adding, Lo! I am with you alway, even to the end of the world. The Divine religion goes out crowned, having the Divine favour resting upon it, armed spiritually against its foes, and destined to be victorious in the end. On opening the second seal, a red horse appeared; this signifies desolating judgments. The sword of war and persecution is a dreadful judgment; it takes away peace from the earth, one of the greatest blessings; and men who should love one another, and help one another, are set upon killing one another. Such scenes also followed the pure age of early Christianity, when, neglectful of charity and the bond of peace, the Christian leaders, divided among themselves, appealed to the sword, and entangled themselves in guilt. On opening the third seal, a black horse appeared; a colour denoting mourning and woe, darkness and ignorance. He that sat on it had a yoke in his hand. Attempts were made to put a yoke of superstitious observances on the disciples. As the stream of Christianity flowed further from its pure fountain, it became more and more corrupt. During the progress of this black horse, the necessaries of life should be at excessive prices, and the more costly things should not be hurt. According to prophetic language, these articles signified that food of religious knowledge, by which the souls of men are sustained unto everlasting life; such we are invited to buy, Isa 55:1. But when the dark clouds of ignorance and superstition, denoted by the black horse, spread over the Christian world, the knowledge and practice of true religion became scarce. When a people loathe their spiritual food, God may justly deprive them of their daily bread. The famine of bread is a terrible judgment; but the famine of the word is more so. Upon opening the fourth seal, another horse appeared, of a pale colour. The rider was Death, the king of terrors. The attendants, or followers of this king of terrors, hell, a state of eternal misery to all who die in their sins; and in times of general destruction, multitudes go down unprepared into the pit. The period of the fourth seal is one of great slaughter and devastation, destroying whatever may tend to make life happy, making ravages on the spiritual lives of men. Thus the mystery of iniquity was completed, and its power extended both over the lives and consciences of men. The exact times of these four seals cannot be ascertained, for the changes were gradual. God gave them power, that is, those instruments of his anger, or those judgments: all public calamities are at his command; they only go forth when God sends them, and no further than he permits.</body></html>
