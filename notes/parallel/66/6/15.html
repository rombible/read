In the list of the great ones here we may notice the descending order--kings, magnates or statesmen, generals, rich men, strong men, bond and free men. The terror strikes into every class: monarchs and their advisers, the statesmen and diplomatists, the commanders of troops, the merchant princes, the men of ability, as well as the obscurer orders of society. Neither royalty, nor rank, nor force of arms, nor opulence, nor talent, nor strength, either of intellect or frame, avail in that crisis; neither does insignificance escape in that day when God brings to light the hidden things. The tests of God are spiritual, as the weapons of God's war are not carnal. Men who have relied upon wealth, rank, or power, have prepared themselves against one form of trial, but find themselves unarmed in the day of spiritual testing. Like Macbeth, they are unable to fight with the unexpected shape which haunts them. They would rather meet the bodily foe, "who would dare them to the desert with a sword."<p>Thus in the final day of judgment the revealing of the spiritual order of all life will confound men whose minds have been blinded by their entire absorption in world-splendours and world-powers. Nor is it merely the unveiling of the forgotten spiritual order which will confound them. The advent is of a Person. It is more than the manifestation of the kingdom of Him who all this while had been King on His throne, and whom they had forgotten--it is the revealing of God's Son from heaven. It is not without significance that He is described as the Lamb. In that day of His wrath, it is not as a Judge who has laid aside the tokens of His humiliation and suffering: it is as the Lamb. He whom they now shrink from is He who came meek as a lamb, gentle, pure, and suffering on their behalf. He whom they now behold with dismay is He whom they treated with neglect, and whose love they spurned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the earth</span>. The first of the seven classes mentioned. The enumeration is again all extensive, embracing all classes, and men of every degree of social distinction. Bishop Newton is probably not correct in seeing an allusion to particular kings. <span class="cmt_word">And the great men;</span> <span class="accented">princes</span> (Revised Version). <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> are the grandees, the courtiers, as distinguished from those who are governors and hold military command, and who are subsequently mentioned as the "chief captains." <span class="cmt_word">And the rich men, and the chief captains</span>. The Revised Version reverses the order, and places "chief captains" first. The chief captains (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are those holding military rank (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-21.htm">Mark 6:21</a>, "Herod made a supper to his lords, high captains," etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18.htm">John 18</a>, "The captain and officers took Jesus;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-31.htm">Acts 21:31</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>, "The chief captain of the band "). <span class="cmt_word">And the mighty men.</span> Probably those possessing great bodily strength. <span class="cmt_word">And every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains.</span> "Every" is omitted before "free man" by A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Andreas, and Arethas. <span class="accented">The dens</span>; in Revised Version <span class="accented">caves</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, "And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth"). Again, as in vers. 12-14, the enumeration is sevenfold; thus denoting the universality and completeness of the extent of the judgment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-17 When the sixth seal was opened, there was a great earthquake. The foundations of churches and states would be terribly shaken. Such bold figurative descriptions of great changes abound in the prophecies of Scripture; for these events are emblems, and declare the end of the world and the day of judgment. Dread and terror would seize on all sorts of men. Neither grandeur, riches, valour, nor strength, can support men at that time. They would be glad to be no more seen; yea, to have no longer any being. Though Christ be a Lamb, he can be angry, and the wrath of the Lamb is exceedingly dreadful; for if the Redeemer himself, who appeases the wrath of God, be our enemy, where shall we find a friend to plead for us? As men have their day of opportunity, and their seasons of grace, so God has his day of righteous wrath. It seems that the overthrow of the paganism of the Roman empire is here meant. The idolaters are described as hiding themselves in their dens and secret caves, and vainly seeking to escape ruin. In such a day, when the signs of the times show those who believe in God's word, that the King of kings is approaching, Christians are called to a decided course, and to a bold confession of Christ and his truth before their fellowmen. Whatever they may have to endure, the short contempt of man is to be borne, rather than that shame which is everlasting.</body></html>
