The same word is used of the green grass in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-39.htm">Mark 6:39</a>, and of the vegetation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>; but, applied to man, it is generally connected with terror, disease, or death. The Greek poets use it as an epithet of fear, and Thucydides thus describes the colour of persons affected by the plague. <span class="cmt_word">And his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.</span> The preposition differs from that used in the preceding verses: it is here <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>,"above," not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "upon." <span class="accented">And he who was sitting above him, his name</span> [was] <span class="accented">Death.</span> Here we have it plainly stated that the vision is a personification of Death - death in general, death in any and every way, as indicated in the latter part of the verse. This supports the view taken of the first three visions of the seals (see on ver. 2). <span class="accented">Hades</span> follows with <span class="accented">Death</span>, not as a separate infliction, but as the necessary complement of Death in the completion of the vision, swallowing up and guarding, as it were, those seized by the latter. <span class="accented">Death</span> is personified in a similar way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, "Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;" and <span class="accented">Hades</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>, "Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming." The two are also conjoined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>, "The keys of hell and of death;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13, 14</a>, "Death and hell delivered up the dead." Hades cannot signify the place of torment, as Hengstenberg thinks, since these trials are to be inflicted on Christians, not on the wicked merely. Nor is it consonant with the context to suppose (as Ebrard) that <span class="accented">Hades</span> signifies "the dwellers in Hades." <span class="cmt_word">And power was given unto them.</span> The reading "them" is supported by A, C, [P], <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, n 17, 49 (1.40 e sil) Andreas; while B and the Vulgate read <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f7a;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "him." The context shows that both are intended. <span class="cmt_word">Over the fourth part of the earth.</span> There is a general consensus of opinion that this expression betokens a part of mankind. Why the <span class="accented">fourth</span> part is selected is difficult to say. Alford suggests that a reference is intended to the four first seals, each one of which embraces in its action a portion of mankind. But the first seal can hardly be interpreted in this way. Probably the intention is to denote that a part of mankind must be afflicted in this particular way, though no definite proportion is signified. In other words, the second, third, and fourth seals depict troubles which Christians and all mankind will have to undergo; some being afflicted more especially in one way, others in another. The troubles mentioned are not an exhaustive catalogue, but are typical of all sorrows; the selection being probably prompted by the Old Testament passages quoted below, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-13.htm">2 Samuel 24:13</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>. "The fourth part" is an expression found only in this passage. Zullig agrees with Alford in the explanation given above; Hengstenberg, and somewhat similarly Volkmar, think it denotes the partial character of this judgment. Elliott, with very little reason, follows the Vulgate reading, "over the four parts of the earth;" Isaac Williams also thinks the judgment is universal, since that is the idea that the number <span class="accented">four</span> signifies, which, however, is a different thing from a <span class="accented">fourth part. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</span> The passage is another example of the influence of the prophecy of Ezekiel upon the composition of the Apocalypse. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a> the "four sore judgments" are "the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence? This indicates the signification of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> in this place; viz. death by pestilence, not, as in the preceding passage, death in any form (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-26</a>, where the judgments threatened are the sword, <span class="accented">pestilence</span>, and famine. Cf. also the alternative punishments of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-13.htm">2 Samuel 24:13</a>); also 2 Esdras 15:5 <span class="bible_ref">4 Esdr. 15:5</span>, "the sword, and hunger, and death, and destruction"). The wild <span class="accented">beasts of the earth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is very probably a reference to the death of many Christians in the pagan amphitheatres; though the meaning is not necessarily restricted to this form of death. Those to whom the Apocalypse was first addressed would irresistibly be reminded of our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7, 13</a>, "Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places... But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." It is as though St. John echoed the words of our Lord, "These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>); and would say, "I am commissioned to relate these visions of the present and future trials of all in the world, which, however, have been already foretold you by our blessed Lord himself." While, therefore, this passage may be understood literally, since doubtless the Church has suffered all these afflictions at different times, in different members of her body, yet we must understand these four typical judgments to be representative of trouble in all its forms; the fourfold character pointing to its universal nature (see on Revelation 5:9). This has led many writers to see in these inflictions trials of a spiritual nature - a view which may well be included in the proper application, but must not be pressed to the exclusion of any other more literal interpretation. We may thus sum up the results of our investigation of these eight verses. They relate the circumstances attending the opening of the first four seals, and doubtless typify various phases of the trials which are permitted by God to afflict Christians on earth in common with all mankind. Each of the four visions is preceded by the invitation of one of the four living beings, which are representative of creation; and a second feature common to these four visions is the appearance of a rider as the personification of the idea set forth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The visions open with a personification of <span class="accented">Christianity</span>, and an assurance of the ultimate victory which it will gain over the powers of the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Then appears a vision of <span class="accented">war</span>, as one of the typical troubles of mankind, which will ultimately be overcome by the triumph of Christianity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Next follows <span class="accented">famine</span> with all its attendant evils, though it is not permitted to extend to the extremity of the extirpation of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Fourthly comes death in every form - a trial of which every one feels the weight at some time. These four do not picture consecutive events; they may be successive or concurrent; the first is certainly being fulfilled side by side with the others. We may, therefore, be able to point to a particular period or event as a fulfilment of any one of these, but we cannot assign definite times to each as <span class="accented">the</span> complete and ultimate fulfilment, since the trials which are signified must extend to the end of time. <span class="accented">And</span>, in conclusion, while the first application was doubtless intended for the support of the Christians of St. John's age in their temporal difficulties, we must consider the visions equally intended to console Christians of every age, and even to portray the spiritual conflict, destitution, and apostasy which must and will continually arise while the Church remains in part in the world. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Christ, the Lamb, opens the first seal: observe what appeared. A rider on a white horse. By the going forth of this white horse, a time of peace, or the early progress of the Christian religion, seems to be intended; its going forth in purity, at the time when its heavenly Founder sent his apostles to teach all nations, adding, Lo! I am with you alway, even to the end of the world. The Divine religion goes out crowned, having the Divine favour resting upon it, armed spiritually against its foes, and destined to be victorious in the end. On opening the second seal, a red horse appeared; this signifies desolating judgments. The sword of war and persecution is a dreadful judgment; it takes away peace from the earth, one of the greatest blessings; and men who should love one another, and help one another, are set upon killing one another. Such scenes also followed the pure age of early Christianity, when, neglectful of charity and the bond of peace, the Christian leaders, divided among themselves, appealed to the sword, and entangled themselves in guilt. On opening the third seal, a black horse appeared; a colour denoting mourning and woe, darkness and ignorance. He that sat on it had a yoke in his hand. Attempts were made to put a yoke of superstitious observances on the disciples. As the stream of Christianity flowed further from its pure fountain, it became more and more corrupt. During the progress of this black horse, the necessaries of life should be at excessive prices, and the more costly things should not be hurt. According to prophetic language, these articles signified that food of religious knowledge, by which the souls of men are sustained unto everlasting life; such we are invited to buy, Isa 55:1. But when the dark clouds of ignorance and superstition, denoted by the black horse, spread over the Christian world, the knowledge and practice of true religion became scarce. When a people loathe their spiritual food, God may justly deprive them of their daily bread. The famine of bread is a terrible judgment; but the famine of the word is more so. Upon opening the fourth seal, another horse appeared, of a pale colour. The rider was Death, the king of terrors. The attendants, or followers of this king of terrors, hell, a state of eternal misery to all who die in their sins; and in times of general destruction, multitudes go down unprepared into the pit. The period of the fourth seal is one of great slaughter and devastation, destroying whatever may tend to make life happy, making ravages on the spiritual lives of men. Thus the mystery of iniquity was completed, and its power extended both over the lives and consciences of men. The exact times of these four seals cannot be ascertained, for the changes were gradual. God gave them power, that is, those instruments of his anger, or those judgments: all public calamities are at his command; they only go forth when God sends them, and no further than he permits.</body></html>
