The scroll</span> - the parchment book or roll, which is spread out to read, and, when read, roiled up and put away. The passage is apparently founded upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. "The host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll," etc. <span class="cmt_word">And every mountain and island were moved out of their places</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>, "Every mountain and hill shall be made low;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-23.htm">Jeremiah 3:23</a>, "Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains"). The enumeration of <span class="accented">seven</span> objects in vers. 12-14 seems to denote the all extending nature of God's judgment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-17 When the sixth seal was opened, there was a great earthquake. The foundations of churches and states would be terribly shaken. Such bold figurative descriptions of great changes abound in the prophecies of Scripture; for these events are emblems, and declare the end of the world and the day of judgment. Dread and terror would seize on all sorts of men. Neither grandeur, riches, valour, nor strength, can support men at that time. They would be glad to be no more seen; yea, to have no longer any being. Though Christ be a Lamb, he can be angry, and the wrath of the Lamb is exceedingly dreadful; for if the Redeemer himself, who appeases the wrath of God, be our enemy, where shall we find a friend to plead for us? As men have their day of opportunity, and their seasons of grace, so God has his day of righteous wrath. It seems that the overthrow of the paganism of the Roman empire is here meant. The idolaters are described as hiding themselves in their dens and secret caves, and vainly seeking to escape ruin. In such a day, when the signs of the times show those who believe in God's word, that the King of kings is approaching, Christians are called to a decided course, and to a bold confession of Christ and his truth before their fellowmen. Whatever they may have to endure, the short contempt of man is to be borne, rather than that shame which is everlasting.</body></html>
