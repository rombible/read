"Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm" title="Ask of me, and I shall give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.">Psalm 2:8</a>). It is the kingdom--not, as in the English version, "the kingdoms"--of the world which has become Christ's possession. The contest is not for the kingdoms, the separate nationalities: the varying political systems might exist, as far as mere organisation is concerned, under the rule of Christ; the contest is for the kingdom of the world. Satan was willing to surrender the kingdoms of the world to our Lord on condition of a homage which would have left him still in possession of the kingdom of the world. But now the close of the contest is the overthrow of the kingdom of evil, the establishment of the kingdom of good: that is, of God; <span class= "ital">and He shall reign for ever and ever.</span> Dean Alford pointed out that our familiarity with the "Hallelujah Chorus" tempted us to put an emphasis on the word <span class= "ital">He </span>which is not sanctioned by the Greek; it is the <span class= "ital">reign</span> of the Lord which is the prominent thought. The reign is unto the ages of ages. Surely this means <span class= "ital">always. </span>We are not told whose voices sing this chorus; it is just the tumultuous sound of heavenly voices, growing into natural and irresistible chorus as the trumpet heralds the approach of the glorious end.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying</span>. The participle "saying" is masculine, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, in A, B; the feminine, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, P. Though the latter would be more correct, grammatically, yet irregular construction in such cases is not uncommon in the Apocalypse. The <span class="accented">voices</span> were possibly those of the angels rejoicing in the triumph of the kingdom of God. Or perhaps they proceeded from the four living beings, since the elders are next mentioned (ver. 17) as offering the praises of the redeemed Church which they represent. At the opening of the seventh seal there was silence in heaven; here, at the sound of the seventh angel's trumpet, <span class="accented">voices</span> are heard "in heaven," but there is silence as to the fate of the wicked, with whom the trumpet visions have been chiefly concerned. In the revelation of the fate in store for the Church, as well as in that of the doom awarded to the ungodly, the visions stop short of describing circumstances connected with the life after the judgment day. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdoms of this world are become</span> the kingdoms <span class="cmt_word">of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in the singular, is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, and versions, and is adopted by the Revised Version. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the plural, is read in two cursives. We can understand the first part of this verse by referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>. God's power and authority is established by the final overthrow of Satan. It naturally follows the account, in vers. 12, 13, of the vindication of God's witnesses, and of the glory rendered by the rest of mankind. With God the Father is associated Christ, by whose means the overthrow of the devil is effected, and by whom his servants overcome (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>). This is the final victory; henceforth "he shall reign forever and ever." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:14-19 Before the sounding of the seventh and last trumpet, there is the usual demand of attention. The saints and angels in heaven know the right of our God and Saviour to rule over all the world. But the nations met God's wrath with their own anger. It was a time in which he was beginning to reward his people's faithful services, and sufferings; and their enemies fretted against God, and so increased their guilt, and hastened their destruction. By the opening the temple of God in heaven, may be meant, that there was a more free communication between heaven and earth; prayer and praises more freely and frequently going up, graces and blessings plentifully coming down. But it rather seems to refer to the church of God on earth. In the reign of antichrist, God's law was laid aside, and made void by traditions and decrees; the Scriptures were locked up from the people, but now they are brought to the view of all. This, like the ark, is a token of the presence of God returned to his people, and his favour toward them in Jesus Christ, as the Propitiation for their sins. The great blessing of the Reformation was attended with very awful providences; as by terrible things in righteousness God answered the prayers presented in his holy temple now opened.</body></html>
