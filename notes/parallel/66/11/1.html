The whole transaction is impersonal. The reed, like a measuring rod, is given him, and at the same time the command is given to arise and measure the Temple, and the altar, and them that worship in the Temple. Here, again, we find the basis of the vision in the Old Testament. Ezekiel was brought, in vision, to a high mountain, and saw a man with a line of flax (for measuring long distances) and a measuring line (for shorter distances). But, more probably, the vision of Zechariah was in the seer's mind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/2-1.htm" title="I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.">Zechariah 2:1-2</a>), for the vision there of the man with the measuring rod to measure Jerusalem is followed, in the fourth chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/4-1.htm" title="And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.">Zechariah 4:1-6</a>), by the vision of the two olive-trees, which are distinctly identified with the two witnesses in the present chapter (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-3.htm" title="And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.">Revelation 11:3-4</a>). The Temple, altar, and worshippers are to be measured. The measuring implies the protecting of, or the token of a resolve to protect, a portion of the sacred enclosure from desecration. The measuring, like the sealing of Revelation 7, is a sign of preservation during impending dangers. To understand what is thus measured out for protection we must remember that there are two Greek words which are rendered Temple: the one (<span class= "ital">hieron</span>) signifies "the whole compass of the sacred enclosure, including the outer courts, porches, porticoes, and other buildings subordinated to the Temple itself;" the other (<span class= "ital">naos)</span> is the Temple itself, the house of God, the Holy and Holy of Holies. When it is said that Christ taught the people in the Temple, the first of these words is used; and it may be supposed that in one of the porches or courts of the sanctuary our Lord carried on His teaching. But when Zacharias is described as going into the Temple, the word is the second (<span class= "ital">naos</span>), for he went into the Temple proper, and left the people in the outer court, or court where the brazen altar stood. It is the second of these words which is used here: the Temple proper, the <span class= "ital">naos,</span> the house of God, is measured, together with the altar. <span class= "ital">We</span> are not told which altar is intended. It is at least too hasty to say that it must be the altar of incense, as this alone was in the Temple proper; for the explicit direction to measure the altar sounds like an extension of the measured area, and may perhaps mean that some portion of the court reserved for Israel is to be included in the measurement. The next verse, however, seems to imply that every spot outside the Temple proper was given up to the Gentiles, and was not to be measured. It is perhaps wisest, therefore, not to settle too definitely. The gist of the measurement is the preservation of the true, invisible Church, the Church within the Church; and everything necessary to the worship--Temple, altar, worshippers--all are reserved. There will always be the real and the conventional--the true and the formal Christian; always those who profess and call themselves Christians, and those who hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life. These last are the called and chosen and faithful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm" title="These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.">Revelation 17:14</a>), the sealed who dwell in the secret place of the Most High, and find therefore their safe lodging in the night of danger under the shadow of the Almighty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm" title="He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.">Psalm 91:1</a>; comp, also the whole Psalm, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-4.htm" title="These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.">Revelation 11:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-9.htm" title="And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.">Revelation 11:9-13</a>;.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was given me a reed like unto a rod.</span> We are not told by whom the <span class="accented">reed</span> is given, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. the angel has the reed, and so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>, upon which the incident seems founded (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>; and cf. the reference to the outer court in ver. 17). The reed is "like a rod;" that is, like to a <span class="accented">staff.</span> It is for a measuring line, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And the angel stood, saying.</span> Omit all except "saying," as in the Revised Version. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is used absolutely, not as qualifying <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "reed," as Andreas (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-6.htm">Revelation 19:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Rise, and measure the temple of God;</span> rather, <span class="accented">rouse and measure</span>, etc. The imperative verb does not imply anything as to the previous position of St. John. "The temple" is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the shrine or dwelling place of God (as in ver. 19; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>), the inner temple, as distinguished from the <span class="accented">outer court</span> next mentioned. It scarcely seems possible to doubt that <span class="accented">the temple</span> is here figuratively used of the faithful portion of the Church of Christ. The word is plainly thus used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> and Revelation 7:15; and is frequently found with this signification in St. Paul's writings, which were probably known to St. John. Dusterdieck and others think that St. John refers literally to the temple at Jerusalem, and to the earthly Jerusalem. But, if so, this portion of the Apocalypse stands self condemned as a prediction which was falsified within a year or two of its enunciation; for in ver. 13 it is expressly stated that the tenth part of the city fell. And nowhere else in the book do Jerusalem and the temple signify the earthly places. The object of the measurement is generally thought to be to set apart or mark off that which is measured from that which is felt without; but opinions vary as to why the temple is thus set apart, some thinking that it is the literal temple which is given over to destruction, others believing that the measuring is a token of the preservation of the Church of God. But may not the command have been given to St. John in order to direct his attention to the size of the Church of God? This is the common meaning of the expression throughout the Bible; it is so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-5</a>, a passage upon which this is possibly founded; and it is so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15</a>. Moreover, there seems a good explanation of the reason why such an incident, thus explained, should occur here. The six trumpets have spoken of the large portions of mankind against whom they were directed; the sixth has declared that men did nevertheless not repent. The seventh trumpet is about to announce yet more terrible woe for the worldly; and, previous to this, a brief but vivid description is given of the oppression to be suffered by the Church - a description inserted here in order to lead up to, and demonstrate the absolute necessity for, the terrible final judgment. Among the ungodly are even some who are nominally members of the Church, who are typified by the <span class="accented">outer court.</span> No one could be more conscious that only a portion of the Church - "the elect" - was to be saved than the writer of the Epistles to the seven Churches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1-3</a>.). Might not the seer and his hearers be inclined to ask, "Who, then, can be saved? Are there any who escape when so much is said about the punishment in store for men?" In answer to such questions, the seer is bidden to remember, what is apt to be forgotten in the dejection caused by the contemplation of the huge amount of wickedness which undoubtedly exists in the world, viz. the large number of good men who form God's staple. It is to be noticed, also, that no mention is made of the command being actually carried out. It is as if the uttering of the command were sufficient to direct the attention of St. John to the fact which was to be conveyed to him, and that, therefore, the necessity for carrying out the injunction existed no longer. It therefore seems probable that "the temple" must be interpreted symbolically. It is the dwelling place of God, the place in which he is worshipped; that is, the multitude of true believers, or the faithful Church. St. John is bidden to measure it, in order to sustain the faith and hope of himself and his hearers. It is placed in antithesis to the <span class="accented">outer court</span>, the faithless portion of the visible Church of God, which is given over to the Gentiles - the type of all that is worldly. <span class="cmt_word">And the altar, and them that worship therein.</span> The altar of incense alone stood within the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; but this may be only an accessory detail in the general description, and not to be pressed to a particular interpretation. "Them that worship therein" directs our thoughts to the individual members of the one body which collectively is "the temple." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1,2 This prophetical passage about measuring the temple seems to refer to Ezekiel's vision. The design of this measuring seems to be the preservation of the church in times of public danger; or for its trial, or for its reformation. The worshippers must be measured; whether they make God's glory their end, and his word their rule, in all their acts of worship. Those in the outer court, worship in a false manner, or with dissembling hearts, and will be found among his enemies. God will have a temple and an altar in the world, till the end of time. He looks strictly to his temple. The holy city, the visible church, is trodden under foot; is filled with idolaters, infidels, and hypocrites. But the desolations of the church are limited, and she shall be delivered out of all her troubles.</body></html>
