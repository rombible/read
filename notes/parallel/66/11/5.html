These have power to shut the heaven that the rain may not moisten</span> (the earth) <span class= "ital">during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they will.</span> Again the Old Testament basis becomes evident; the histories of Elijah and Moses supply the illustration. The fire devouring their foes seems to allude to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-10.htm" title="And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.">2Kings 1:10</a>; like Elijah, they can close the heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1Kings 17:1</a>); like Moses, they can turn water into blood and summon down every plague (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-20.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.">Exodus 7:20</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.). </span>These last characteristics remind us of the spirit and power of Moses and Elias, but we must not forget what has gone before: the witnesses are like olive trees and lights. In them is concentrated grace, light, and power; their witness recalls the great features of various Old Testament teachers and leaders; they display the light of truth, and men may not oppose or injure them with impunity; they wield a power which it is not safe to provoke. As from the mouths of the great Sixth Trumpet host there went forth fire and smoke and brimstone to kill the third part of mankind, so out of the mouths of these witnesses there goes forth a purer, but mightier flame. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-8.htm" title="There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.">Psalm 18:8</a>.) We may compare the sword out of the mouth of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>), and the promise to Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-14.htm" title="Why thus said the LORD God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.">Jeremiah 5:14</a>), "Behold I will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood, and it shall devour them." The word which is like a sword to lay bare man to himself may become a consuming fire to those who resist or oppose it. The witnesses for God are thus armed with a spiritual might; for that word which, when accepted and lived by, brings peace, when rejected causes pain and danger. Thus often do the things which might have been for men's peace become an occasion for falling; the stone which, used and built into the life, becomes a precious corner-stone and immovable foundation, grinds to powder those upon whom it falls. Thus is it with these witnesses: they come to witness for principles which go to make the world a Paradise once more. The world, which casts away their words, will find them come back with scorching force; just as the breath of God gives life and beauty to the world, and power to men's hearts and lives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm" title="You send forth your spirit, they are created: and you renew the face of the earth.">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-22.htm" title="And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:">John 20:22</a>), yet with that same breath of His lips does He slay the wicked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>). Some have thought that there will be a time when witnesses for God will be raised up who will work literal wonders such as these. It is not for us to say that this will not be the case: all prophecy may take a sharper and clearer meaning as the times of the end draw near; but, meanwhile, it is needful for us to remember that the very power of truth is such that, when rejected, it can and does avenge itself by shutting heaven over our head, and making all the fresh rivulets of life's purest pleasures loathsome as blood to the sensualised and perverted heart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies;</span> <span class="accented">if any one willeth to hurt them</span>, etc. Most probably a reference to the act of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10</a>). Perhaps there is a double reference in the <span class="accented">fire proceeding out of their mouth</span>; it is the <span class="accented">fire</span> of their witness, which refines and purifies and convinces some; it is also the fire of condemnation, which follows those who reject the testimony. The figure is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>, "I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-5.htm">Hosea 6:5</a>; Ecclus. 48:1). <span class="cmt_word">And if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed;</span> <span class="accented">any one shall will</span> (future) is read in the Revised Version, and is supported by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, 38; <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, (present) is found in B, C, P, Andreas, Arethas. "In this manner;" that is, by <span class="accented">fire</span>. Such, throughout the Scriptures, is the form under which the final judgment of those who reject God's message is shadowed forth. The description is not more opposed to a general interpretation than it is to an individual interpretation of the two witnesses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:3-13 In the time of treading down, God kept his faithful witnesses to attest the truth of his word and worship, and the excellence of his ways, The number of these witnesses is small, yet enough. They prophesy in sackcloth. It shows their afflicted, persecuted state, and deep sorrow for the abominations against which they protested. They are supported during their great and hard work, till it is done. When they had prophesied in sackcloth the greatest part of 1260 years, antichrist, the great instrument of the devil, would war against them, with force and violence for a time. Determined rebels against the light rejoice, as on some happy event, when they can silence, drive to a distance, or destroy the faithful servants of Christ, whose doctrine and conduct torment them. It does not appear that the term is yet expired, and the witnesses are not a present exposed to endure such terrible outward sufferings as in former times; but such things may again happen, and there is abundant cause to prophesy in sackcloth, on account of the state of religion. The depressed state of real Christianity may relate only to the western church. The Spirit of life from God, quickens dead souls, and shall quicken the dead bodies of his people, and his dying interest in the world. The revival of God's work and witnesses, will strike terror into the souls of his enemies. Where there is guilt, there is fear; and a persecuting spirit, though cruel, is a cowardly spirit. It will be no small part of the punishment of persecutors, both in this world, and at the great day, that they see the faithful servants of God honoured and advanced. The Lord's witnesses must not be weary of suffering and service, nor hastily grasp at the reward; but must stay till their Master calls them. The consequence of their being thus exalted was a mighty shock and convulsion in the antichristian empire. Events alone can show the meaning of this. But whenever God's work and witnesses revive, the devil's work and witnesses fall before him. And that the slaying of the witnesses is future, appears to be probable.</body></html>
