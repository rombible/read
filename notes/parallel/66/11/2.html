A strong word is used; the words "leave out" are far too weak. He is not only not to measure it, but he is, in a sort, to pass it over, as though reckoned profane. The reason of this is that it was given to the Gentiles. Our Lord had said that Jerusalem should be trodden down of the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.">Luke 21:24</a>); the sacred seer catches the thought and the deeper significance. There is a treading down worse than that of the conqueror. It is the treading under of sacred things when the beast-power, or the world-power in men, tramples, like the swine, the pearls of grace under their feet, and turns fiercely upon those who gave them. Such an experience must the Church of Christ undergo. The shrine shall be safe, but the spirit of the nations, though nominally Christian, will be the spirit of Gentilism, worldliness, and even of violence. In the outer court of Church life there will be "the ebbing and flowing mass," who "sit in the way of knowledge," who "stand idle in the market-place," who have no oil in their lamps, and who indirectly pave the way for utter worldliness and practical heathenism. But there is a limit to this desecration: forty and two months it is to last. The same length of time is expressed in different forms throughout the book. Sometimes we have twelve hundred and sixty days, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm" title="And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.">Revelation 11:3</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-6.htm" title="And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days.">Revelation 12:6</a>; at another time forty-two months, as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm" title="And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given to him to continue forty and two months.">Revelation 13:5</a>. A similar period seems to be meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm" title="And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.">Revelation 12:14</a>, where a time, times, and half a time is probably a way of expressing three years and a half; all three forms describe periods of the same length--not, of course, necessarily the same period. The idea is taken from Daniel, who uses such and similar expressions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-11.htm" title="And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.">Daniel 12:11</a>). This incorporation of the expressions used by Daniel is one of those hints which remind us that the laws and principles of God's government are the same in all ages: so that the principles which receive illustration in one set of historical events are likely to receive similar illustrations in after times; and that the prophecies of one era may contain seeds of fulfilments which spring to fruit in more than one age. Thus the words of Daniel were not exhausted in the age of Antiochus, nor the visions of the Apocalypse in the overthrow of any one nation or the corruptions of any one Church. So much may this constantly-recurring period of three years and a half, or forty-two months, or twelve hundred and sixty days, teach us. It is not needful, then, to take the period as an exact literal period. It is true that there have been some remarkable historical periods of this length, which various schools of interpreters have pointed out as the fulfilment of these prophecies; but there have been also remarkable blunders on the part of those who, forgetful of Christ's own warning, have tried to predict the year when certain prophecies will receive their accomplishments. It is true, also, that the future may bring us further light, and enable us to understand these descriptions of time better; but for the present, the period of forty and two months, the equivalent of three years and a half (the half of seven, the complete and divine number), is the symbol of a period limited in length, and under the control of Him who holds the seven stars and lives through the ages. It is the pilgrimage period of the Church, the period of the world's power, during which it seems to triumph; but the period of sackcloth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm" title="And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.">Revelation 11:3</a>) and of suffering will not last forever.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles;</span> <span class="accented">it hath been given</span> (Revised Version). Not merely "leave out," but "cast out." The "court which is without the temple" was entered only by Jews. It seems, therefore, here to signify part of the Church, but that part which is separated from the inner circle of true believers, and given over to the world, which is here symbolized by "the Gentiles." The <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, the <span class="accented">nations</span>, throughout the Apocalypse, signifies either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> all mankind whatsoever; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that portion of mankind which is left when the true Church of God is withdrawn, and therefore which embraces the unrighteous part of mankind in contrast to the godly (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>; 22:22). The latter is the signification here. And the holy city shall they tread underfoot. The holy city - Jerusalem - always in the Apocalypse the type of the Church. "They shall tread" need not necessarily refer to "the nations," though the context naturally leads to this signification; but it may be impersonal, amounting to no more than "the holy city shall be trodden underfoot." St. John seems to apply the words of our Lord concerning the literal Jerusalem to the description of the fate in store for the typical Jerusalem (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>). "The nations" are the instrument by which the Church is trodden underfoot, and the mention of the Gentiles in connection with the apostate portion of the Church leads to the description of the oppression of the faithful by the world. The seer is bidden to take courage by a contemplation of the numbers of those preserved by God, but is warned, nevertheless, not to expect from that fact immunity for the Church from the persecution of the world. <span class="cmt_word">Forty and two months</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, "and," is inserted contrary to the common practice when the larger number precedes (so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a>). This period of three years and a half is certainly symbolical. It is the half of seven years - a perfect number. It therefore denotes a broken, uncertain period; a space of time which is certainly finite, but the end of which is uncertain. This seems to point necessarily to the period of the world's existence during which the Church is to suffer oppression. This period is mentioned <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in ver. 3 under the form of twelve hundred and sixty days, where it denotes the same period that is referred to here; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a> as twelve hundred and sixty days, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a> as "a time, and times, and half a time," in both of which passages the signification is the same as that given above; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a> it is called, as here, forty-two months, and describes the same period. The expression is founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> and Daniel 12:7. In the latter place the time signified is certainly the period of the world's existence. We therefore see <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that its natural meaning, in connection with the number seven, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> its signification in Daniel, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> its apparent use in all passages in the Apocalypse, tend to cause us to interpret the symbol as above. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1,2 This prophetical passage about measuring the temple seems to refer to Ezekiel's vision. The design of this measuring seems to be the preservation of the church in times of public danger; or for its trial, or for its reformation. The worshippers must be measured; whether they make God's glory their end, and his word their rule, in all their acts of worship. Those in the outer court, worship in a false manner, or with dissembling hearts, and will be found among his enemies. God will have a temple and an altar in the world, till the end of time. He looks strictly to his temple. The holy city, the visible church, is trodden under foot; is filled with idolaters, infidels, and hypocrites. But the desolations of the church are limited, and she shall be delivered out of all her troubles.</body></html>
