Is it accidental that the number is the same as the number of those who had not bowed to Baal?

The visible Church of Christ is stirred; there is a reaction from the spirit of worldliness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the same hour was there a great earthquake.</span> In the visions of the seals it is set forth, under the sixth seal, how the destruction of the world is accompanied by earthquakes, etc.; the fear of the wicked is portrayed, and the preservation of the just takes place at the same time. Here, under the sixth trumpet, we have the same events shown forth, the triumph of the godly being mentioned first, though the rest happens "in that same hour." This is the conclusion of the sixth judgment, the consequence of the non repentance mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>. The intervening narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-11:12</a>) serves to show that opportunities of knowing God's will are given to men, as well as warnings of judgment in ease of disobedience. Vers. 13 of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>. might follow <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>, but for the desire of the seer to demonstrate the long suffering goodness and mercy of God. And the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand. Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version have in the margin, "names of men, seven thousand," and some writers make much of the expression. Thus Alford says, "As if the name of each were recounted;" and Wordsworth, "Persons known and distinguished." But, in truth, the phrase is a Hebraism, to which we can attach no special significance (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>). Whatever may he the system of interpretation adopted, this passage presents many difficulties. The whole account appears to relate to the judgment day, and it is therefore more peculiarly prophetic than many parts of the Apocalypse, and for that reason its meaning must needs be more or less obscure. The account in this verse informs us that a part (a tenth) of the city (that is, of the wicked) suffers destruction; that the number so destroyed is described as seven thousand; that the rest (nine tenths), in fear, recognize the power of God, to which they had hitherto refused attention. What is the final fate awarded to the nine tenths we are not told. We have, therefore, to inquire the meaning of the numbers given. Now, it seems inherently impossible to interpret these numbers literally, and, moreover, as we have repeatedly seen, it is not the habit of the writer of the Apocalypse to indicate exact numbers. We must, therefore, try to discover the symbolical meaning which St. John attached to these expressions, the qualities rather than the quantities which he intended to signify. In the Bible <span class="accented">the tenth part</span> invariably signifies the tithe - the portion due from the community to God or to the ruler (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-32.htm">Leviticus 27:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15, 17</a>). it seems probable that this was the idea intended to be conveyed, viz. that God was now exacting his due, that men who had refused to recognize what was due from them to God were now forced to recognize his sovereignty by the exaction for punishment of a tithe, and as an evidence that all are under his sway. But, it may be objected, are not all the wicked punished at the judgment? This verse really seems to hint at a possibility of some course by which, even at the last moment, a chance of escape may be presented to men. But it does not distinctly state this; it seems, indeed, purposely to leave the fate of the rest of the ungodly untold. All it does assert is that God comes to the wicked as a Conqueror or a King, and exacts what is due to himself. But, further, why are <span class="accented">seven thousand</span> men slain? Again interpreting symbolically, <span class="accented">seven</span> involves the idea of completeness (see on Revelation 1:4; 5:1, etc.). A thousand signifies a large number, though not an infinitely large number, for which we have "thousands of thousands," etc. This number, therefore, informs us that God's vengeance overtakes a large number, and that that number is complete, none escaping who deserve to be included. Perhaps this is mentioned as a precaution against any possibility of mistake in the interpretation of the "tenth part." It is as though St. John would say, "In that hour God exacted vengeance, demanding what was due to his justice; but do not imagine that that vengeance reached only a small part of mankind. It was far extending and complete, though I do not attempt to define its exact limits, which cannot be known until the judgment day itself shall reveal everything." <span class="cmt_word">And the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span> <span class="accented">The rest gave glory</span>, being, perhaps (though not necessarily), repentant (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm">John 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-9.htm">Revelation 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9</a>). Possibly we have here a hint of God's uncovenanted mercies (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), though there is nothing sufficiently definite to encourage men to postpone the day of repentance. No mention is made of the ultimate fate of "the remnant." "The God of heaven," in contrast to things of the world, upon which their affections had been hitherto set (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-11.htm">Revelation 16:11</a>). In these two places alone of the New Testament is this expression found; but it is not uncommon in the Old Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:3-13 In the time of treading down, God kept his faithful witnesses to attest the truth of his word and worship, and the excellence of his ways, The number of these witnesses is small, yet enough. They prophesy in sackcloth. It shows their afflicted, persecuted state, and deep sorrow for the abominations against which they protested. They are supported during their great and hard work, till it is done. When they had prophesied in sackcloth the greatest part of 1260 years, antichrist, the great instrument of the devil, would war against them, with force and violence for a time. Determined rebels against the light rejoice, as on some happy event, when they can silence, drive to a distance, or destroy the faithful servants of Christ, whose doctrine and conduct torment them. It does not appear that the term is yet expired, and the witnesses are not a present exposed to endure such terrible outward sufferings as in former times; but such things may again happen, and there is abundant cause to prophesy in sackcloth, on account of the state of religion. The depressed state of real Christianity may relate only to the western church. The Spirit of life from God, quickens dead souls, and shall quicken the dead bodies of his people, and his dying interest in the world. The revival of God's work and witnesses, will strike terror into the souls of his enemies. Where there is guilt, there is fear; and a persecuting spirit, though cruel, is a cowardly spirit. It will be no small part of the punishment of persecutors, both in this world, and at the great day, that they see the faithful servants of God honoured and advanced. The Lord's witnesses must not be weary of suffering and service, nor hastily grasp at the reward; but must stay till their Master calls them. The consequence of their being thus exalted was a mighty shock and convulsion in the antichristian empire. Events alone can show the meaning of this. But whenever God's work and witnesses revive, the devil's work and witnesses fall before him. And that the slaying of the witnesses is future, appears to be probable.</body></html>
