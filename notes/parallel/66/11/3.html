At present it is best to lay down the lines which seem to lead in the direction of such a solution. First, the aim of the present vision must be kept in mind; and secondly, the vision in Zechariah (Zechariah 4, all), on which this is professedly built, must be remembered. Now the aim of our present vision seems to be to explain that in the great progress towards victory the Church itself will suffer through corruptions and worldliness, but that the true Temple--the kernel, so to speak, of the Church--will be unharmed and kept safe in her Master's hands. But the position of this hidden and enshrined Church will not be one of idle security; in that Temple will be reared in secret, as the rightful king Josiah was, those who will witness undaunted and undefiled for their Lord; throughout the whole of that chequered period of profanation and pain there will never be wanting true witnesses for righteousness and faith. To assure the sacred seer that this would be the ease, to exhibit the nature of their work and its results, is the apparent aim of the vision. If this be so, the witnesses can scarcely be literal individual men, though it is true that many literal individual men have played the part of these witnesses. Turning to the foundation vision in Zechariah, we find that the vision there is designed to encourage the weak and restored exiles in their work of rebuilding the Temple; they are shown that, weak as they are, there is a hidden strength, like a sacred stream of oil, which can make them triumph over all their difficulties: not by might or power, but by God's Spirit, the mountain would become a plain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6-7</a>), and "Grace! Grace!" would be the triumphant shout when the headstone of the Temple was raised. In both visions, then, our minds are turned to the hidden sources of divine strength; there is a safe and secret place measured off by God, where He gives His children strength--not of ordinary might or power, but strength of grace. This is the grace which made Zerubbabel and Joshua strong to achieve their work; this is the grace which can make the two witnesses strong to do their part in the building of that more glorious spiritual temple which is built on the foundation of Apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone. The witnesses, then, stand as the typical representatives of those who, in the strength of God, have, through the long ages, borne witness for Christ against all wrong and falsehood, against a world in arms or a Church in error, or against a nominal Christianity in danger of becoming as corrupt and as cruel as heathenism. Such witnesses stand, like the two columns Jachin and Boaz, before the true Temple of God.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">And </span>I <span class= "bld">will give . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And I will give</span> (omit "power") <span class= "ital">to my two witnesses</span>, <span class= "ital">and they shall .</span> . . These are the words of God Himself; the omission of the words "and the angel stood" from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.">Revelation 11:1</a> prevents any confusion of thought on this point. Two witnesses were required for competent evidence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.),</span> and there has constantly been a sending forth of God's chosen messengers in pairs-- Moses and Aaron, Elijah and Elisha, besides Joshua and Zerubbabel, alluded to by Zechariah; and in New Testament times our Lord sent forth His disciples "two and two," as afterwards Paul and Barnabas, or Paul and Silas, went forth to preach. There is, besides the mere mutual support which two can give, a need for the association of two different characters in the same sort of work: the energy and the sympathy, the elucidator of doctrines and the messenger to the conscience, the apologist and the evangelist, the man of thought and the man of action, the Son of Thunder and the Son of Consolation; it is well that in a world-wide work this duality of power should be brought into play. The witnesses <span class= "ital">prophesy</span>: the word prophesy must surely be allowed a much wider meaning than merely to predict or foretell future events. The compass of their work, as described afterwards, embraces much more than this (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-5.htm" title="And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.">Revelation 11:5-7</a>): they work wonders, showing tokens that remind us of the days of Moses and Aaron; their words are mighty; their life is a testimony.<p>Their prophesying, or witnessing, extends over forty and two months: a symbolical period, as we have seen, but a period corresponding to that during which other witnesses had witnessed for God. Thus long did Elijah bear witness, under rainless heavens, against the idolatries of Israel; thus long did a greater than Elijah offer the water of life to the Jews, and witness against the hard, unspiritual, worldly religionism of the Pharisee and Sadducee; thus, too, must the witnesses, for God bear testimony during the period that the world- power seems dominant. They are clad in sackcloth-- the emblem of mourning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-30.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by on the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within on his flesh.">2Kings 6:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-4.htm" title="And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.">Jonah 3:4</a>) adopted by the prophets, whose God-taught hearts saw reasons for mourning where shallower minds saw none (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.">Zechariah 13:2</a>). Compare the garb of Elijah and John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm" title="And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.">2Kings 1:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>), whose very apparel and appearance were designed to testify against the evils they saw. "The special witnesses of God, in a luxurious and self-pleasing age, are often marked out from the world by signs of self-denial, of austerity, and even of isolation" (Dr. Vaughan).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will give power unto my two witnesses.</span> Omit "power." What is given follows, viz. "they shall prophesy," etc. The voice, speaking in the name of Christ, says, <span class="accented">"My:</span> The two witnesses of me;" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "the," as though they were well known. There is much diversity of interpretation in regard to "the two witnesses." It seems reasonable to understand the two witnesses as representative of the elect Church of God (embracing both Jewish and Christian) and of the witness which she bears concerning God, especially in the Old and New Testaments. The following considerations seem to support this interpretation: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The vision is evidently founded on that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4.htm">Zechariah 4</a>, where it is emblematical of the restored temple, which only in the preceding verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>) is a type of the elect of God's Church (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Apocalypse continually represents the Church of God, after the pattern of the life of Christ, in three aspects - that of conflict and degradation; that of preservation; that of triumph (see Professor Milligan's Baird Lectures, 'The Revelation of St. John,' lect. 2 and 5.). This is a summary of the vision here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Much of the Apocalypse follows our Lord's description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>. In that chapter (vers. 13, 14) we have, "He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come." Again, a brief description of this vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is not probable that two individuals are meant; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> as we have shown throughout the Apocalypse, the application is invariably to principles and societies, though this may include particular applications in certain cases; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> it is inconceivable that Moses and Elias, or any other of the saints of God, should return from Paradise to suffer as these two witnesses; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> our Lord expressly explained the reference to the coming of Elias, and declared that he had already come; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> there seems no more reason for interpreting these two witnesses literally of two men, than for interpreting Sodom and Egypt in their ordinary geographical signification in ver. 8. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The details of the fate of the two witnesses agree with the interpretation given - the whole vision being understood as symbolical. Thus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the picture of the two witnesses is evidently formed after the pattern of Moses and Elias, on account of the conspicuous witness they bore and the hardship they suffered, as well as their preservation and final vindication. Moreover, Moses and Elias are typical of the Law and the prophets, or the Scriptures - the means (as stated above) by which the Church chiefly bears witness of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The time during which they prophesy; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the clothing in sackcloth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> the appellation of candlesticks and olive trees; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> their power to hurt; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> their apparent death; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(g)</span> the torment they cause; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(h)</span> their resuscitation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(i)</span> their vindication; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(k)</span> the immediate advent of the final judgment; - all agree (as shown below) with the interpretation given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Witness is constantly connected in the Apocalypse and elsewhere with the Church, and generally with suffering, sometimes with triumph (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2, 5, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a> we are told, "The testimony [witness] of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy," exactly the quality with which the two witnesses are credited (ver. 3), and which is the work of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">And they shall prophesy;</span> that is, "prophesy" in its literal meaning of forthtelling God's will and his judgments on the wicked, and so of preaching repentance. This is emphatically the work of the Church, and is accomplished chiefly through the Scriptures. It is this prophesying that torments (see vers. 5, 10). <span class="cmt_word">A thousand two hundred</span> and <span class="cmt_word">three score days.</span> Or, forty and two months (ver. 2). During the period of the world's existence (see on ver. 2) the Church, although "trodden underfoot," will not cease to "prophesy." <span class="cmt_word">Clothed in sackcloth.</span> Thus, symbolically, is expressed the same fact as in ver. 2. The Church there is "trodden underfoot" during the period of the world; here it is said that she is to perform her office during this time "clothed in sackcloth." The treatment by the world of both the Church of God and the Word of God is represented by the apparel of mourning and woe, which is the lot of the Church on earth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:3-13 In the time of treading down, God kept his faithful witnesses to attest the truth of his word and worship, and the excellence of his ways, The number of these witnesses is small, yet enough. They prophesy in sackcloth. It shows their afflicted, persecuted state, and deep sorrow for the abominations against which they protested. They are supported during their great and hard work, till it is done. When they had prophesied in sackcloth the greatest part of 1260 years, antichrist, the great instrument of the devil, would war against them, with force and violence for a time. Determined rebels against the light rejoice, as on some happy event, when they can silence, drive to a distance, or destroy the faithful servants of Christ, whose doctrine and conduct torment them. It does not appear that the term is yet expired, and the witnesses are not a present exposed to endure such terrible outward sufferings as in former times; but such things may again happen, and there is abundant cause to prophesy in sackcloth, on account of the state of religion. The depressed state of real Christianity may relate only to the western church. The Spirit of life from God, quickens dead souls, and shall quicken the dead bodies of his people, and his dying interest in the world. The revival of God's work and witnesses, will strike terror into the souls of his enemies. Where there is guilt, there is fear; and a persecuting spirit, though cruel, is a cowardly spirit. It will be no small part of the punishment of persecutors, both in this world, and at the great day, that they see the faithful servants of God honoured and advanced. The Lord's witnesses must not be weary of suffering and service, nor hastily grasp at the reward; but must stay till their Master calls them. The consequence of their being thus exalted was a mighty shock and convulsion in the antichristian empire. Events alone can show the meaning of this. But whenever God's work and witnesses revive, the devil's work and witnesses fall before him. And that the slaying of the witnesses is future, appears to be probable.</body></html>
