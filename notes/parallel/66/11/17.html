We can catch the echo of the Second Psalm throughout this chorus of grateful praise. The prayers of the groaning Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/18-7.htm" title="And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night to him, though he bear long with them?">Luke 18:7-8</a>) and the cries of travailing creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>) have been heard; though the heathen raged and the people imagined a vain thing, their counsel against the Lord and His anointed, His Christ (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-16.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,">Revelation 11:16</a>), came to nought; the joy of their triumph was short-lived; the kingdom of evil was but for a moment; the kings were assembled, they passed by, they saw, they were troubled, they hasted away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/48-4.htm" title="For, see, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.">Psalm 48:4-5</a>); never did the real sovereignty of the Lord cease (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>); but the nations would not believe in His rule; they were not wise; they turned from the kiss of reconciliation, which was life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/2-10.htm" title="Be wise now therefore, O you kings: be instructed, you judges of the earth.">Psalm 2:10-12</a>); then came His anger, and the season of judgment and the season of reward. The prophets, the saints, and those that fear God's name, the small and the great-- every class and rank of the true servants of the King are included here; none are forgotten; not a cup of cold water, given in His name, shall miss its reward; for not alone the pre-eminent in Christian power and in Christian holiness, but the weak, the struggling, the obscure, the small as well as the great, are remembered: "Unto the God of gods appeareth every one of them in Zion" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm" title="They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appears before God.">Psalm 84:7</a>; Prayer Book version). Nor is the gladness only for this blessing; there is a joy at the overthrow of those who destroy the earth. The reign of evil is the destruction of the earth. The judgments of God are in mercy to stay the spread of destructive powers and principles. The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel; the very judgments of God are merciful. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-2.htm" title="And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.">Revelation 8:2</a>.)<p>But where, we may be disposed to ask, is the "woe" in all this? We are led to expect that the seventh trumpet as a woe trumpet will bring in some period of pain and trouble, as the others have done; but all we hear is the chorus of glad voices uttering praise: we see no token of woe. The answer is that we must not overlook all that this song of rejoicing implies. The chorus we hear is the thanksgiving to God that the hour has come for the overthrow of the kingdom of evil, the manifestation of the sons of God, and the acknowledgment throughout the world of the sovereignty of the Lord and of His Christ. The overthrow of that evil kingdom, which is now to take place, brings with it woo to those who have supported it; for the time of the judgment of the dead, and of those whose lives have marred God's world, has come. It is, then, woe on all those who have misused God's gifts and those beautiful things which He gave us liberally to enjoy. It is a woe on those who have defiled those bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost, profaned the earth, which is God's footstool, or darkened by their evil deeds the heaven, which is His throne. Those who thus defile (or, <span class= "ital">destroy:</span> the word is so in the margin, and is the same as that which follows) God's temple anywhere, God will destroy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.">1Corinthians 3:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saying, We give thee thanks.</span> The only instance in the Apocalypse of the use of this verb. It is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-11.htm">John 6:11, 23</a>, and John 11:41, but in none of the ether Gospels, though frequently in the Epistles. "The elders" are peculiarly indebted to God, since the establishment of his kingdom is the victory of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come;</span> <span class="accented">the Almighty.</span> Omit "and art to come" (Revised Version), with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius, Syriac, Armenian, etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>). Perhaps the future is purposely omitted, since God's "coming" is now an accomplished fact (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>). Because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned; <span class="accented">because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign</span> (Revised Version). God never ceased to reign, though for a time he abrogated his <span class="accented">power.</span> This <span class="accented">power</span> he has now reassumed, and the elders thank him for it, for it is the assurance of the end of the suffering of the Church of God. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> the elders declare that he is worthy to receive the <span class="accented">power</span> which he now visibly exercises. It has, indeed, been exercised before. The preservation of the Church set forth in the visions of the seals, and the punishment of the ungodly shown under the trumpet visions, are effected by means of this power; but now that power is visibly exercised. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:14-19 Before the sounding of the seventh and last trumpet, there is the usual demand of attention. The saints and angels in heaven know the right of our God and Saviour to rule over all the world. But the nations met God's wrath with their own anger. It was a time in which he was beginning to reward his people's faithful services, and sufferings; and their enemies fretted against God, and so increased their guilt, and hastened their destruction. By the opening the temple of God in heaven, may be meant, that there was a more free communication between heaven and earth; prayer and praises more freely and frequently going up, graces and blessings plentifully coming down. But it rather seems to refer to the church of God on earth. In the reign of antichrist, God's law was laid aside, and made void by traditions and decrees; the Scriptures were locked up from the people, but now they are brought to the view of all. This, like the ark, is a token of the presence of God returned to his people, and his favour toward them in Jesus Christ, as the Propitiation for their sins. The great blessing of the Reformation was attended with very awful providences; as by terrible things in righteousness God answered the prayers presented in his holy temple now opened.</body></html>
