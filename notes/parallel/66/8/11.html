The bitter, nauseous plant known as wormwood (apsinthos) is used to represent troubles and calamities. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.">Jeremiah 9:15</a> we have an example of this: "Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink." It is worth noticing that the Israelites are warned against idolatry as "a root that beareth gall and wormwood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>); and we may recall the symbolical act of Moses, who ground the golden calf to powder, cast the powder in the brook, and made the children of Israel drink (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-20.htm" title="And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.">Exodus 32:20</a>). Some have thought that this falling star signified some false teacher, whose evil influence poisoned the pure currents of the gospel, and perverted the minds of men of original genius, who are represented here as fountains. The passages cited above favour the thought, and it may be included in the general meaning of the vision; but the main point seems to be to give us hints of those stages which will mark the advance of Christianity. The fall of the great men, the rulers and leaders, will take place, and their fall will bring misery to mankind. Doubtless the appearance of false teachers in the Church is one of the evidences find an unavoidable accompaniment of a progressing faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-26.htm" title="But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.">Matthew 13:26</a>). But all such false lights shall fall before Him who is the true Light and Morning Star, and who will heal all embittered waters of life. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-23.htm" title="And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.">Exodus 15:23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-19.htm" title="And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.">2Kings 2:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the star is called Wormwood.</span> The plant known to us under the name of <span class="accented">wormwood</span> is doubtless identical with the <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of this passage. The present English word is a corruption of <span class="accented">wer-mod</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">ware-mood</span>), which may be rendered "mind-preserver," a name given to the plant by the Saxons, on account of its fancied virtues; for it was believed to be a protection against madness. Such properties were formerly frequently ascribed to plants possessing bitter and nauseous tastes, such as that of the wormwood. Varieties of the plant are common in Palestine, and are widely distributed in the world. Among the ancients it was typical of bitter sorrow. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a>, "Remembering my misery, the wormwood and the gall;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>, "I will feed them with wormwood." Here, therefore, the name indicates the effect of the star, viz. to cause intense trouble and sorrow. <span class="cmt_word">And the third part of the waters became wormwood;</span> that is, became bitter as wormwood, that is, charged with sorrow and disaster. The general effect of the incident is described in the name given to the chief actor, as in the case of the fourth seal (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter;</span> <span class="accented">many of the men.</span> Possibly (though not necessarily) of the men dwelling near the waters. For the first time mention is made of the death of <span class="accented">men</span>, though, doubtless, it is implied in the preceding judgments. We may notice the contrast in the miracles of Moses, who sweetened the waters of Marah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>.), and of Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-22.htm">2 Kings 2:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:7-13 The first angel sounded the first trumpet, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood. A storm of heresies, a mixture of dreadful errors falling on the church, or a tempest of destruction. The second angel sounded, and a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood. By this mountain some understand leaders of the persecutions; others, Rome sacked by the Goths and Vandals, with great slaughter and cruelty. The third angel sounded, and there fell a star from heaven. Some take this to be an eminent governor; others take it to be some person in power who corrupted the churches of Christ. The doctrines of the gospel, the springs of spiritual life, comfort, and vigour, to the souls of men, are corrupted and made bitter by the mixture of dangerous errors, so that the souls of men find ruin where they sought refreshment. The fourth angel sounded, and darkness fell upon the great lights of heaven, that give light to the world, the sun, and the moon, and the stars. The guides and governors are placed higher than the people, and are to dispense light, and kind influences to them. Where the gospel comes to a people, and has not proper effects on their hearts and lives, it is followed with dreadful judgments. God gives alarm by the written word, by ministers, by men's own consciences, and by the signs of the times; so that if people are surprised, it is their own fault. The anger of God makes all comforts bitter, and even life itself burdensome. But God, in this world, sets bounds to the most terrible judgments. Corruption of doctrine and worship in the church are great judgments, and also are the usual causes and tokens of other judgments coming on a people. Before the other three trumpets were sounded, there was solemn warning how terrible the calamities would be that should follow. If lesser judgments do not take effect the church and the world must expect greater; and when God comes to punish the world, the inhabitants shall tremble before him. Let sinners take warning to flee from the wrath to come; let believers learn to value and to be thankful for their privileges; and let them patiently continue in well doing.</body></html>
