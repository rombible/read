It flies through the meridian sky, and is thus visible to the very horizon. It was an appropriate emblem: high-soaring as the spirit of the seer, the eagle-glance scanned the borders of the earth, and caught sight of the coming troubles, and gave warning; swift and strong as the judgments of God, its very form gave emphasis to the warnings of its voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm" title="The LORD shall bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand;">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm" title="Set the trumpet to your mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.">Hosea 8:1</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-28.htm" title="For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.">Matthew 24:28</a>). And yet the emblem must bring to the minds of God's children the care of Him who led Israel, instructed him, and kept him as the apple of His eye, and cherished him as "an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, and beareth them on her wings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm" title="As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>). Is it not also a precursor of those eagle-like judgments which fall upon the carcase of dead nations or a dead society?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld, and heard an angel.</span> "An eagle" (Revised Version) is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, etc., while "angel" is found in P, 1, 16, 34, 47, etc. One manuscript (13) has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. St. John sees <span class="accented">one eagle</span>, the symbol of what is swift and unerring in swooping upon its prey. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>, "The eagle that hasteth to the prey" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). This is the meaning of the appearance of <span class="accented">the eagle</span>, which announces the swiftness and certainty of the coming woes. De Wette and others unnecessarily understand "an angel in the form of an eagle." De Lyra interprets it as St. John himself. Wordsworth, relying chiefly on the force of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span>, believes that Christ is signified; but it is extremely doubtful whether the force of the numeral can be pressed so far. Others see a reference to the Roman legions, etc. The figure may have been suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Flying through the midst of heaven;</span> <span class="accented">flying in mid heaven</span> (Revised Version). Not "midway between earth and heaven," but "in the direct line of the sun." The word is found only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a> and Revelation 19:17. In the former it is rendered as in this place, in the latter it is translated "in the sun." The eagle is thus plainly visible to all. <span class="cmt_word">Saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth!</span> "Woe" is followed by "inhabiters" in the accusative case, according to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B; though the dative is read in A, P, and some cursives. "The inhabiters of the earth" are the ungodly, the worldly, those on whom God's wrath had been invoked by the saints at rest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>), whose prayer is now answered The triple denunciation renders the threatened judgments more emphatic and terrible. <span class="cmt_word">By reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound;</span> Greek, <span class="accented">out of the other voices</span> (denoting front whence the woe proceeds) <span class="accented">who are yet to sound.</span> "Trumpet," in the singular, because taken distributively - "of each trumpet."

A storm of heresies, a mixture of dreadful errors falling on the church, or a tempest of destruction. The second angel sounded, and a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood. By this mountain some understand leaders of the persecutions; others, Rome sacked by the Goths and Vandals, with great slaughter and cruelty. The third angel sounded, and there fell a star from heaven. Some take this to be an eminent governor; others take it to be some person in power who corrupted the churches of Christ. The doctrines of the gospel, the springs of spiritual life, comfort, and vigour, to the souls of men, are corrupted and made bitter by the mixture of dangerous errors, so that the souls of men find ruin where they sought refreshment. The fourth angel sounded, and darkness fell upon the great lights of heaven, that give light to the world, the sun, and the moon, and the stars. The guides and governors are placed higher than the people, and are to dispense light, and kind influences to them. Where the gospel comes to a people, and has not proper effects on their hearts and lives, it is followed with dreadful judgments. God gives alarm by the written word, by ministers, by men's own consciences, and by the signs of the times; so that if people are surprised, it is their own fault. The anger of God makes all comforts bitter, and even life itself burdensome. But God, in this world, sets bounds to the most terrible judgments. Corruption of doctrine and worship in the church are great judgments, and also are the usual causes and tokens of other judgments coming on a people. Before the other three trumpets were sounded, there was solemn warning how terrible the calamities would be that should follow. If lesser judgments do not take effect the church and the world must expect greater; and when God comes to punish the world, the inhabitants shall tremble before him. Let sinners take warning to flee from the wrath to come; let believers learn to value and to be thankful for their privileges; and let them patiently continue in well doing.</body></html>
