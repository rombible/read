Some have thought that by this other angel we are to understand Christ Himself. This is very doubtful: the designation "another angel" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-2.htm" title="And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,">Revelation 7:2</a>) is against this view. There is really no need to ask who the several angels are: the book is symbolical. The angels are not particular personages, but symbolical of those agencies--whether personal, or natural, or supernatural--which are employed by Him who sitteth on the throne. The angel stood at the altar. The altar mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm" title="And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.">Revelation 6:2</a> corresponded with the altar of burnt sacrifice, which stood in the open court in front of the tabernacle or temple. The symbolism of the Apocalypse being so largely built up out of Jewish materials, we need not be surprised to find the altar of incense introduced here. This altar was of gold, and was situated in the holy place. Here the priest was wont to burn incense, while the people outside were praying. We have an example of the custom in the history of Zecharias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,">Luke 1:8-11</a>). The scene described by St. Luke bears a close resemblance to this, and gives a key to the symbolism. The prayers of the people and the smoke of the incense are ascending together. The angel has a golden censer. The word here rendered censer is used sometimes for the incense, but the epithet "golden" shows that it is the vessel to hold the incense which is intended. The censer is of gold, as was the altar, and as are so many things in the Apocalypse. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/15-6.htm" title="And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.">Revelation 15:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-15.htm" title="And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.">Revelation 21:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-21.htm" title="And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.">Revelation 21:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And there was given unto him much incense </span>. . .--Literally, <span class= "ital">And there was given to him much incense that he might</span> (not "offer it with," as English version, but) <span class= "ital">give it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</span> The incense was to be mingled with the prayers of the saints. The incense was added to give a fragrance to the prayers of the saints, and render them acceptable before God. The action of the angel has been spoken of as though it might give countenance to the erroneous doctrine of the mediatorship of saints and angels. It is only when we persist in viewing symbols as literal facts that there is any danger of such an inference. Dogmas, whose only foundation is in the incidental symbolism of a prophetic book, are ill-grounded. It is a safe canon that doctrinal inferences from metaphors are always to be suspected. The angel here is a mere symbol of a divinely- appointed agency. No personal angel actually ever did what is described here: how could incense mix with prayers? The whole is symbolical of the truth, that the prayers of all the saints need to be rendered acceptable by the infusion of some divine element. The best prayers of the best saints are weak, and polluted and imperfect at the best. The incense which is added to the prayers is not supplied by the angel: it is first given to him, and he then mingles it with the prayers of all saints. It is hard to forget here Him whose offering and sacrifice became a savour of sweet smell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-1.htm" title="Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children;">Ephesians 5:1-2</a>). The altar is described as the golden altar--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the altar of incense, as noted above. It is well for us to remember Dean Alford's caution that we must not attempt to force the details of any of these visions into accordance with the arrangements of the tabernacle. "A general analogy in the use and character of the heavenly furniture is all that we can look for" (Alford, <span class= "ital">in loco).</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And another angel came.</span> No particular angel is specified. Some writers, unable to accept the passage as meaning that the Church's prayers are offered by means of an angel, prefer to believe that Christ himself is indicated. (Thus Bede, Elliott, Primasius, Vitringa.) But, besides that the difficulty has no real existence, the same expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>, where there is no doubt of its meaning. Moreover, in no passage of the book is our Lord represented under the form of an angel. With regard to the office of the angels, Alford remarks (while supporting the view that the word here bears the ordinary signification), "They are simply <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, and the action here described is a portion of that their ministry. <span class="accented">Through whom</span> the prayers are offered, we all know. He is our only Mediator and channel of grace." So also Wordsworth, "The angel is not here represented as giving <span class="accented">efficacy</span> to the prayers of all saints, but as taking part in them. There is a <span class="accented">communication</span> of prayer between <span class="accented">all</span> saints (namely, the saints departed, and the saints on earth), and the <span class="accented">holy angels</span> in heaven." And stood at the altar. The Revisers, accepting the reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, Andreas, adopt <span class="accented">over the altar.</span> The Authorized reading follows A, P, 1, 17, 36. Alford remarks, "<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with genitive, not simply <span class="accented">juxta</span>, not <span class="accented">ante</span>, but <span class="accented">super</span>; so that his form appeared above it." <span class="accented">The altar</span> has been already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>). If the view there taken be correct, and the <span class="accented">brazen altar</span> of sacrifice intended, the two altars mentioned in this verse are not identical; the second represents the golden altar of incense which stood before the veil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>), but which now stands before the throne of God, the veil having disappeared. This view seems to be the correct one. The second altar is distinguished from the first by the addition of the qualification, "which was before the throne," as well as by the epithet "golden" - facts which are not mentioned in connection with the throne alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>. The order of events followed here, though not given in minute detail, resembles the ceremony of the Jewish worship. In the temple, the priest took burning coals from off the brazen altar, and proceeded to the altar of incense, on which to burn incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12, 13</a>). There appears to be a kind of progression in the insight which the seer affords us of the heavenly worship. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a> a door is opened, and St. John sees into heaven; he is, as it were, without the sanctuary. In this place he is permitted to advance in his vision within the sanctuary, and to observe the golden altar. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a> and Revelation 15:5 the most holy place is disclosed, and the ark of the covenant is seen. Alford and Dusterdieck believe only one altar is here mentioned, and identify it with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>. De Wette, Hengstenberg, Wordsworth, think one altar only is intended, and that it is the altar of incense. Bengel, Ebrard, Vitringa, support the view given above. Bossuct says the altar is Christ, to whom the angel brings incense, that is, the prayers of the saints. <span class="cmt_word">Having a golden censer.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is found only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-29.htm">1 Chronicles 9:29</a> (LXX.). In the latter place it is rightly rendered "frankincense;" but the meaning here evidently requires "censer." It is described as of gold, in the same way that all the furniture of the heavenly realms is described in the Apocalypse. <span class="cmt_word">And there was given unto him much incense.</span> Apparently following the analogy of the temple service, the first angel brings in his <span class="accented">golden censer</span> fire from the brazen altar of sacrifice, and now there is "given unto him," by another angel, incense to burn at the <span class="accented">golden altar</span> of incense. (For <span class="accented">incense</span>, see on Revelation 5:8.) <span class="cmt_word">That he should offer it with the prayers of all saints;</span> <span class="accented">add it unto the prayers of all the saints</span> (Revised Version). The prayers are to be incensed, so as to (typically) render them pure and acceptable to God. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</span> That is, probably, the altar of incense, distinct from the altar mentioned earlier in this verse (see above). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The seventh seal is opened. There was profound silence in heaven for a space; all was quiet in the church, for whenever the church on earth cries through oppression, that cry reaches up to heaven; or it is a silence of expectation. Trumpets were given to the angels, who were to sound them. The Lord Jesus is the High Priest of the church, having a golden censer, and much incense, fulness of merit in his own glorious person. Would that men studied to know the fulness that is in Christ, and endeavoured to be acquainted with his excellency. Would that they were truly persuaded that Christ has such an office as that of Intercessor, which he now performs with deep sympathy. No prayers, thus recommended, was ever denied hearing and acceptance. These prayers, thus accepted in heaven, produced great changes upon earth. The Christian worship and religion, pure and heavenly in its origin and nature, when sent down to earth and conflicting with the passions and worldly projects of sinful men, produced remarkable tumults, here set forth in prophetical language, as our Lord himself declared, Lu 12:49.</body></html>
