The "Amen" rises from universal nature; the Church of Christ falls down in silent adoration. Thought and feeling assert themselves above all language. There are times when silence is the most eloquent applause; there are times when it is also the most real worship. "Let thy prayers be without words, rather than thy words, without prayer" was a wise precept of an old divine. An English and an Italian poet have given expression to the same feeling of the weakness of words. "O speech !" sang Dante, when telling his final vision--<p>"How feeble and how faint art thou to give<p>Conception birth."<p>--<span class= "ital">Parad</span>. xxxiii.<p>Thomson takes refuge in silence from the overwhelming thoughts of the divine glory:--<p>"I lose<p>Myself in Him, in light ineffable.<p>Come, then, expressive silence, muse His praise."<p>Here the inspired seer describes the chorus of praise as dying into a silence born of awe and gratefulness and love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth forever and ever.</span> (On the signification of the four beasts as representative of creation, and the four-and-twenty elders as typical of the Church, see on Revelation 4:4 and 6.) Three stages are marked in the hymn of adoration before this concluding verse: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the four living beings and the four and twenty elders worship the Lamb, and commemorate their redemption by him; they are able to sing "a new song" - the song of the redeemed; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the angels join in the worship of the Lamb, ascribing to him the consummation of all perfection; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> then all created things praise God and the Lamb. In conclusion, the representatives of redeemed creation once more join in the eucharistic hymn, and prostrate themselves in worship before the Triune God. This forms the end of one act of the heavenly drama. The opening of the seals now follows, and a description of the attendant circumstances is given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-14 It is matter of joy to all the world, to see that God deals with men in grace and mercy through the Redeemer. He governs the world, not merely as a Creator, but as our Saviour. The harps were instruments of praise; the vials were full of odours, or incense, which signify the prayers of the saints: prayer and praise should always go together. Christ has redeemed his people from the bondage of sin, guilt, and Satan. He has not only purchased liberty for them, but the highest honour and preferment; he made them kings and priests; kings, to rule over their own spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he makes them priests; giving them access to himself, and liberty to offer up spiritual sacrifices. What words can more fully declare that Christ is, and ought to be worshipped, equally with the Father, by all creatures, to all eternity! Happy those who shall adore and praise in heaven, and who shall for ever bless the Lamb, who delivered and set them apart for himself by his blood. How worthy art thou, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, of our highest praises! All creatures should proclaim thy greatness, and adore thy majesty.</body></html>
