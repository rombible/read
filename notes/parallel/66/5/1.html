It is written, not on the inside only, as was the usual way, but, like the roll of the book which Ezekiel saw (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/2-9.htm" title="And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent to me; and, see, a roll of a book was therein;">Ezekiel 2:9-10</a>), it was written within and without. Some have thought that there are two divisions of predictions --those written within the roll, and those written on the outer side. This is merely fanciful; the passage in Ezekiel which supplies a guidance to the meaning might have shown the erroneousness of the thought. Clearly the "lamentation and mourning and woe" inscribed all over Ezekiel's roll indicate the filling up of sorrows: here the same overflowing writing indicates the completeness of the contents; there was no room for addition to that which was written therein. But what is meant by the book? Numberless interpretations have been offered: it is the Old Testament; it is the whole Bible; it is the title-deed of man's inheritance<span class= "bld">;</span> it is the book containing the sentence of judgment on the foes of the faith; it is the Apocalypse; it is part of the Apocalypse; it is the book of God's purposes and providence. There is a truth underlying most of these interpretations, but most of them narrow the force of the vision. If we say it is the book which unfolds the principles of God's government--in a wide sense, the book of salvation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25-26</a>)-- the interpretation of life, which Christ alone can bestow (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/5-3.htm" title="And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.">Revelation 5:3-6</a>), we shall include, probably, the practical truths which underlie each of these interpretations; for all--Old Testament and New, man's heritage and destiny, God's purposes and providence-- are dark, till He who is the Light unfolds those truths which shed a light on all. Such a book becomes one "which contains and interprets human history," and claims the kingdoms of the earth for God. The aim of all literature has been said by a distinguished critic to be little more than the criticism of life; the book which Christ unfolds is the key to the true meaning of life. The roll is not the Apocalypse so much as the book of those truths which are exemplified in the Apocalypse, as in a vast chamber of imagery. The roll was fast sealed, so that even those who were wise and learned enough to read it had it been unrolled could not do so (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm" title="And the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he said, I cannot; for it is sealed:">Isaiah 29:11</a>.) There are things which are hidden from the wise and prudent, but revealed unto babes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw.</span> As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>, this phrase introduces a new incident in the vision. That which had been witnessed remained, but a further development now takes place. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>. relates the revelation of the glory of the Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2) surrounded by his Church and creation. The glory of Jesus Christ, the Lamb, is now set forth, since he is the only One worthy to receive and declare to his Church the mystery contained in the sealed book. <span class="cmt_word">In the right hand</span>; <span class="accented">upon the right hand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>). That is, lying upon the hand, as it was extended in the act of offering the book to any one who should be able to open and read it. <span class="cmt_word">Of him that sat on the throne</span>. The Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2). <span class="cmt_word">A book written within and on the back side</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9, 10</a> the "roll of a book" is "written within and without;" another of the numerous traces in the Revelation of the influence of the writings of this prophet upon the writer of the Apocalypse, though the picture of the Lamb, which follows in this chapter, imparts a new feature peculiar to St. John's vision. The roll was inscribed on both sides. Mention is made of such a roll by Pliny, JuVenal, Lucian, Martial, though Grotius connects <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "on the back," with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "sealed," thus rendering, "written within and sealed on the back." The fulness of the book, and the guard of <span class="accented">seven</span> seals which are opened in succession, denote completeness of revelation (on the number <span class="accented">seven</span> as denoting full completion, see on Revelation 1:4). This book contained the whole of "the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>). It is noteworthy that - so far as we can gather from the Revelation - the book is never read. The breaking of each seal is accompanied by its own peculiar phenomena, which appear to indicate the nature of the contents. And the opening of the seventh seal especially is attended by a compound series of events; but nowhere are we explicitly informed of the contents of the book. Alford well remarks, "Not its contents, but the gradual steps of access to it, are represented by these visions." This view seems to be held also by Schleiermacher. Dusterdieck considers that the roll is never read, though the incidents attending the opening of each seal portray a portion of the contents. Wordsworth and Elliott understand that, as each seal is broken, a part of the roll is unrolled and its contents rendered visible; and these contents are symbolically set forth by the events which then take place. According to this view, the whole is a prophecy extending to the end of the world. The popular idea is that the roll was sealed along the edge with seven seals, all visible at the same time. If, as each seal was broken, a portion of the roll could be unfolded, of course only one seal - the outermost - could be visible. This is not, however, inconsistent with St. John's assertion that there were <span class="accented">seven</span> seals - a fact which he might state from his knowledge gained by witnessing the opening of the seven in succession. The truth seems to lie midway between these views. We must remember that the Revelation was vouchsafed to the Church as an encouragement to her members to persevere under much suffering and tribulation, and as a support to their faith, lest they should succumb to the temptation of despair, and, unable to fathom the eternal purposes of God, should doubt his truth or his ability to aid them. But we are nowhere led to believe that it was the intention of God to reveal <span class="accented">all</span> things to man, even under the cloak of symbolism or allegory. There is much which must necessarily be withheld until after the end of all earthly things; and, just as no mortal can possibly know the "new name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>), so no one on earth can receive perfect knowledge of the "mysteries of the kingdom of heaven," which were symbolically contained in the book, and which, through the intervention of the Lamb, may one day be published; though a portion - sufficient for the time - was shadowed forth, at the opening of the seals; which portion, indeed, could never have been given to us except through the Lamb. We understand, therefore, that the book is symbolical of the <span class="accented">whole</span> of the mysteries of God; that, as a whole, the contents of the book are not, nor indeed can be, revealed to us while on earth; but that some small but sufficient portion of these mysteries are made known to us by the power of Christ, who will eventually make all things clear hereafter, when we shall know even as we are known (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). The events attending the opening of the seals are therefore a prophecy of the relations of the Church and the world to the end of time. Many opinions have been held as to the antitype of the book. Victorinus thinks it to be the Old Testament, the meaning of which Christ was the first to unlock. And Bede and others consider that the writing within signified the New Testament, and that on the back, the Old. Todd and De Burgh think the roll denotes the office of our Lord, by virtue of which he will judge the world. <span class="cmt_word">Sealed with seven seals</span>; <span class="accented">sealed down with seven seals</span>; <span class="accented">close sealed</span> (Revised Version). Grotius connects <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "behind," with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "sealed down," thus reading, "written within and sealed down on the back." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-7 The apostle saw in the hand of Him that sat upon the throne, a roll of parchments in the form usual in those times, and sealed with seven seals. This represented the secret purposes of God about to be revealed. The designs and methods of Divine Providence, toward the church and the world, are stated, fixed, and made a matter of record. The counsels of God are altogether hidden from the eye and understanding of the creature. The several parts are not unsealed and opened at once, but after each other, till the whole mystery of God's counsel and conduct is finished in the world. The creatures cannot open it, nor read it; the Lord only can do so. Those who see most of God, are most desirous to see more; and those who have seen his glory, desire to know his will. But even good men may be too eager and hasty to look into the mysteries of the Divine conduct. Such desires, if not soon answered, turn to grief and sorrow. If John wept much because he could not look into the book of God's decrees, what reason have many to shed floods of tears for their ignorance of the gospel of Christ! of that on which everlasting salvation depends! We need not weep that we cannot foresee future events respecting ourselves in this world; the eager expectation of future prospects, or the foresight of future calamities, would alike unfit us for present duties and conflicts, or render our prosperous days distressing. Yet we may desire to learn, from the promises and prophecies of Scripture, what will be the final event to believers and to the church; and the Incarnate Son has prevailed, that we should learn all that we need to know. Christ stands as Mediator between God and both ministers and people. He is called a Lion, but he appears as a Lamb slain. He appears with the marks of his sufferings, to show that he pleads for us in heaven, in virtue of his satisfaction. He appears as a Lamb, having seven horns and seven eyes; perfect power to execute all the will of God, and perfect wisdom to understand it, and to do it in the most effectual manner. The Father put the book of his eternal counsels into the hand of Christ, and Christ readily and gladly took it into his hand; for he delights to make known the will of his Father; and the Holy Spirit is given by him to reveal the truth and will of God.</body></html>
