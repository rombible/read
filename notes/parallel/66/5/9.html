As he records his vision, he sees it anew; he describes the action as though it were even now taking place, and he still hears the notes of praise. He who knows what it is to have the strains of some rich melody haunt him for days will understand how the prophet would hear the glad chorus burst forth afresh in his ears when he recalled the vision. The new song; the chorus of the redeemed--<p>"Worthy art Thou to take the roll,<p>And to open the seals thereof;<p>For Thou wast slain,<p>And didst buy to God in Thy blood<p>Out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,<p>And didst make them a kingdom and priests,<p>And they reign upon the earth."<p>The English version, "hast redeemed," and "hast made," weakens the reference to the completed character of Christ's redeeming work. It is the great victory in suffering and death which inspires the song, and makes them sing, "Thou art worthy;" and so they speak of that work of Christ as a <span class= "ital">work truly</span> done: "Thou didst buy (omit "us") out of every tribe, &c., and <span class= "ital">didst</span> make them," &c. The suffering Saviour has died, has broken the bond of the oppressor, has claimed, by right of purchase, mankind as His own; and the price was His blood. It is well to notice the harmony between this passage and the statements of other Apostles: "Ye are not your own;" "bought with a price." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm" title="You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.">1Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>.) Observe, also, the <span class= "ital">four</span> terms (tribe, tongue, people, nation), employed as if to give emphasis to the universality of redemption, for four is the number of extension in all directions. With this compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>. We have a right to teach all to say, "He redeemed me and all mankind." It is instructive to dwell on the climax "they reign," in contrast with "Thou wast slain." It is like an anticipation of the now familiar words--<p>"Thine the sharp thorns, and mine the golden crown;<p>Mine the life won, and Thine the life laid down."<p>"Didst make them a kingdom and priests." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>.) This kingdom and reign is the outcome of Christ's work. "Every precept of Christianity is quickened by the power of the death and resurrection of Christ. It is by the presence of this power that they are Christians, and it is as Christians that they conquer the world" (Westcott). "They reign on the earth." Such is the best reading; the tense is present It is not, I think, to be explained away as a vivid realisation of the future; it is a simple statement, which is as true as that the followers of Christ are "a kingdom and priests." They reign with and in Christ, but they also reign on the earth. Christ gives them a kingship, even sovereignty over themselves--the first, best, and most philanthropic of all kingships. He gives them, too, a kingship on the earth among men, for they are exerting those influences, promoting those principles, and dispensing those laws of righteousness, holiness, and peace which in reality rule all the best developments of life and history. All who traverse these laws are intruders, transitory tyrants, exerting only a phantom power. They are not kings: they may govern, they do not reign. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-21.htm" title="Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;">1Corinthians 3:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they sung a new song, saying</span>. <span class="accented">They sing</span>; the worship is unceasing. The song is <span class="accented">new</span> because it is only now, subsequent to the accomplishment of Christ's work of redemption, that the song can be sung. It is not" Thou art worthy, for thou <span class="accented">wilt redeem,"</span> but <span class="accented">"thou didst redeem."</span> Victorinus says, "It is the preaching of the Old Testament together with that of the New which enables the world to sing a new song." Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof. (For a consideration of <span class="accented">the book</span>, and the opening of it, see on ver. 1.) For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood. The reason why Christ is worthy. <span class="accented">And didst redeem unto God by thy blood out of every kindred</span>, etc. Though the reading "us" is supported by various manuscripts, and similarly the first person is used in ver. 10. yet, on the whole, it seems better to omit it, the phrase being taken in a partitve sense - "Thou didst redeem unto God by thy blood <span class="accented">some</span> out of every kindred, etc., and hast made <span class="accented">them</span>, etc., and <span class="accented">they</span> shall reign." Again, "Thou didst purchase us <span class="accented">at the price of</span> thy blood" would, perhaps, give the sense more correctly; for such is the force of the words, "in thy blood" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). The words point to a particular act performed at a definite time, viz. the death of Christ, by which he repurchased men from sin and Satan for the service of God; the price of the purchase being the shedding of his own blood. The words show, too, that the fruits of the redemption are intended for the whole world; not limited to any chosen nation, though some are excluded by their own act. <span class="cmt_word">Out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation</span>. This fourfold classification continually recurs in the Revelation. It includes all the bases of classification of mankind, all the circumstances which separate men, the barriers which were overthrown by the redeeming work of Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-14 It is matter of joy to all the world, to see that God deals with men in grace and mercy through the Redeemer. He governs the world, not merely as a Creator, but as our Saviour. The harps were instruments of praise; the vials were full of odours, or incense, which signify the prayers of the saints: prayer and praise should always go together. Christ has redeemed his people from the bondage of sin, guilt, and Satan. He has not only purchased liberty for them, but the highest honour and preferment; he made them kings and priests; kings, to rule over their own spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he makes them priests; giving them access to himself, and liberty to offer up spiritual sacrifices. What words can more fully declare that Christ is, and ought to be worshipped, equally with the Father, by all creatures, to all eternity! Happy those who shall adore and praise in heaven, and who shall for ever bless the Lamb, who delivered and set them apart for himself by his blood. How worthy art thou, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, of our highest praises! All creatures should proclaim thy greatness, and adore thy majesty.</body></html>
