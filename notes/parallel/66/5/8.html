The vials (which seem to be censers, as they hold the incense) and the harps, it is perhaps more natural to suppose, were in the hands of the four-and-twenty elders, and not of the living creatures. Here, then, we have the praises (represented by the harps), and the prayers (represented by the censers) of the world-wide and age-long Church of Christ. The comparison of prayer with incense is in strict accordance with Old Testament language. "Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm" title="Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.">Psalm 141:2</a>). The incense held a conspicuous place in the ritual of the Temple. The greatest care was to be taken in the composition of the incense, and the same compound was not to be used anywhere but in the sanctuary. These precautions suggest its typical character. The true odours are the heart-prayers of God's children. "Of these three sweet ingredient perfumes," says Archbishop Leighton, alluding to the composition of the Temple-incense, "namely, petition, confession, thanksgiving, is the incense of prayer, and by the divine fire of love it ascends unto God, the heart and all with it; and when the hearts of the saints unite in joint prayer, the pillar of sweet smoke goes up the greater and the fuller." Every prayer which broke out in sob from an agonising heart, every sigh of the solitary and struggling Christian, every groan of those groping God- ward, mingles here with the songs of the happy and triumphant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - And when he had taken the book. "Had taken" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>) is here aorist, not perfect, as in ver. 7. The text should probably read, <span class="accented">when he took the book</span>; that is to say, the adoration offered coincides in point of time with the act of taking the book. <span class="cmt_word">The four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb.</span> <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">four beasts as</span> representing animated creation; the <span class="accented">four and twenty elders as</span> representative of the Church (see on Revelation 4:4, 6). <span class="cmt_word">Having every one of them harps.</span> (On the difficulty of <span class="accented">how</span> each one could hold harps and bowls, see on ver. 6.) It is possible that the phrase refers only to the elders; for these seem more suitably employed in offering <span class="accented">the prayers of the saints</span> than the representatives of all creation. If, however, as Wordsworth considers, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders together symbolize the Church, the phrase would apply to both. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-16.htm">1 Samuel 16:16, 23</a> (the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of this passage) was played with the hand, and the instrument indicated was probably more of the nature of a guitar than the modern harp. <span class="cmt_word">And golden vials full of odours</span>. The Revised Version "bowls" is better than "vials." The idea is, no doubt, taken from the shallow bowls which were placed upon the golden altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>), and in which incense was burned. The <span class="accented">odours</span> are the <span class="accented">incense. In</span> the same chapter of Exodus directions are given concerning the preparation and use of the incense, which was always a symbol of prayer, and always offered to God alone (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which are the prayers of saints.</span> <span class="accented">The saints</span>; that is, the members of the Church of God. Some authorities consider "vials" the antecedent of" which;" but it seems best to refer "which" to "odours," though the sense is not materially different, since the former includes the latter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-14 It is matter of joy to all the world, to see that God deals with men in grace and mercy through the Redeemer. He governs the world, not merely as a Creator, but as our Saviour. The harps were instruments of praise; the vials were full of odours, or incense, which signify the prayers of the saints: prayer and praise should always go together. Christ has redeemed his people from the bondage of sin, guilt, and Satan. He has not only purchased liberty for them, but the highest honour and preferment; he made them kings and priests; kings, to rule over their own spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he makes them priests; giving them access to himself, and liberty to offer up spiritual sacrifices. What words can more fully declare that Christ is, and ought to be worshipped, equally with the Father, by all creatures, to all eternity! Happy those who shall adore and praise in heaven, and who shall for ever bless the Lamb, who delivered and set them apart for himself by his blood. How worthy art thou, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, of our highest praises! All creatures should proclaim thy greatness, and adore thy majesty.</body></html>
