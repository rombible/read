We have noticed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>) the increasing strength of the doxologies in which the redeemed take part. This, though a <span class= "ital">sevenfold</span> one, does not interrupt that advance of praise; for in this chorus the redeemed do not take part. The definite article is prefixed to the word "power" only; in the doxologies of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-12.htm" title="Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be to our God for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 7:12</a> it stands before each word. This has led some to view the single article as prefixed to all that follows, and to regard all the words as though they formed one word. May it not, however, be used to give emphasis to the "power"? None, above or below, was "able" (same word as "power" here) to open the book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-3.htm" title="And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.">Revelation 5:3</a>); but the Lamb has conquered to open it, and the chorus proclaims the Lamb worthy of that power. Some have thought that the seven terms of the doxology refer to the seven seals which the Lamb is about to open. This seems strained. The notion of completeness is common to this seven-fold blessing and the seven seals; this is the only connection between them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saying with a loud voice;</span> <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">great voice</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "saying," is irregular construction, and to be referred to <span class="accented">angels</span> as being a nominative understood. <span class="cmt_word">Worthy is the Lamb that was slain;</span> <span class="accented">that hath been slain</span> (Revised Version). Again, as in ver. 9, the worshippers give the reason for considering Christ worthy to receive their adoration. It is because he had been slain and thus redeemed the world. <span class="cmt_word">To receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</span> The sevenfold nature of the adoration attributed to the Lamb is probably indicative of its complete and perfect nature. (On the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to receive," to take as a right what is offered, see Thayer-Grimm.) <span class="accented">Power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the ability to perform which is inherent in one's nature. <span class="accented">Strength</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>) is the attribute by which that power is put into operation; it frequently denotes physical strength. <span class="accented">Riches</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>, "And of his fulness have all we received;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>, "The unsearchable riches of Christ;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, "Every good gift and every perfect gilt is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>, "He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things "). The whole sevenfold ascription is spoken as one, only one article being prefixed. In this respect it differs from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>, where we have <span class="accented">"the</span> glory" and "<span class="accented">the</span> honour," etc. (see on Revelation 4:11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-14 It is matter of joy to all the world, to see that God deals with men in grace and mercy through the Redeemer. He governs the world, not merely as a Creator, but as our Saviour. The harps were instruments of praise; the vials were full of odours, or incense, which signify the prayers of the saints: prayer and praise should always go together. Christ has redeemed his people from the bondage of sin, guilt, and Satan. He has not only purchased liberty for them, but the highest honour and preferment; he made them kings and priests; kings, to rule over their own spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he makes them priests; giving them access to himself, and liberty to offer up spiritual sacrifices. What words can more fully declare that Christ is, and ought to be worshipped, equally with the Father, by all creatures, to all eternity! Happy those who shall adore and praise in heaven, and who shall for ever bless the Lamb, who delivered and set them apart for himself by his blood. How worthy art thou, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, of our highest praises! All creatures should proclaim thy greatness, and adore thy majesty.</body></html>
