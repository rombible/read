If the Revelation is true, there can be no breach in the sympathies of any part of God's voluntary and intelligent universe." It is needless to observe that the numbers are not to be taken literally; they are simply employed to express the countless throng of that "innumerable company of angels" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>) which raised the song--<p>"Loud as from numbers without number, sweet<p>As from blest voices, uttering joy."<p><span class= "ital">--Paradise Lost,</span> iii. 346, 347.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld</span> marks a new feature of the vision, viz. the introduction of the angelic host as taking part in the adoration of the Lamb (see on Revelation 4:1). <span class="cmt_word">And heard the voice of many angels</span>; a <span class="accented">voice.</span> The angels who have "desired to look into" the mystery of the redemption of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>) have now had declared to them "by the Church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10, 11</a>); and are thus enabled to join in the song of the redeemed. <span class="cmt_word">Round about the throne and the beasts and the elders.</span> The innumerable company of angels encircle the throne and the beasts and the elders. Thus the throne is in the vision seen as occupying the centre, the four living creatures are placed round it in different directions; the elders form the next circle, and the angels enclose the whole. The Lamb is in the midst before the throne (see on Revelation 4:6). "Thus," says Bisping, "the redeemed creation stands nearer to the throne of God than even the angels (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">And the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.</span> The readings vary here, though the sense of the passage is not affected.

The number is, of course, not to be taken literally, but as expressive of an exceeding great multitude. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-14 It is matter of joy to all the world, to see that God deals with men in grace and mercy through the Redeemer. He governs the world, not merely as a Creator, but as our Saviour. The harps were instruments of praise; the vials were full of odours, or incense, which signify the prayers of the saints: prayer and praise should always go together. Christ has redeemed his people from the bondage of sin, guilt, and Satan. He has not only purchased liberty for them, but the highest honour and preferment; he made them kings and priests; kings, to rule over their own spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he makes them priests; giving them access to himself, and liberty to offer up spiritual sacrifices. What words can more fully declare that Christ is, and ought to be worshipped, equally with the Father, by all creatures, to all eternity! Happy those who shall adore and praise in heaven, and who shall for ever bless the Lamb, who delivered and set them apart for himself by his blood. How worthy art thou, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, of our highest praises! All creatures should proclaim thy greatness, and adore thy majesty.</body></html>
