The song of the redeemed, echoed by the hosts of angels, is now merged in the utterance of all. "Every creature which is in the heaven, and upon the earth, and beneath the earth, and upon the sea, and all the things that are in them, heard I saying--<p>"To Him that sitteth upon the throne,<p>And to the Lamb,<p>(Be) the blessing, and the honour,<p>And the glory, and the might,<p>To the ages of the ages."<p>The song of praise rises from all quarters, and from all forms of creation. The whole universe, animate and inanimate, joins in this glad acclaim. To limit it to either rational or animate creation is to enfeeble the climax which this third chorus forms to the two preceding ones, and is to denude the passage of its fulness and of its poetry. The Hebrew mind delighted in representing every bird and every grass-blade as joining in God's praise. "Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars, beasts and all cattle, creeping things and flying fowl," as well as kings of the earth and all people, were called on to bless the name of the Lord. Christian poets have told us that "Earth with her thousand voices praises God."<p>"Nature, attend! join every living soul,<p>Beneath the spacious temple of the sky,<p>In adoration join'd; and, ardent, raise<p>One general song! To Him, ye vocal gales,<p>Breathe soft, whose Spirit in your freshness breathes.<p>***And thou, majestic main,<p>A secret world of wonders in thyself,<p>Sound His stupendous praise, whose greater voice<p>Or bids you roar, or bids your roaring fall.<p>Soft roll your incense, herbs, and fruits, and flowers,<p>In mingled clouds to Him whose sun exalts,<p>Whose breath perfumes you, and whose pencil paints."<p>--Thomson, <span class= "ital">Hymn to Seasons.</span><p>The Apostle who pictured all creation as waiting in eager expectation for the full redemption--the redemption of "the body" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>), looked forward to the time when "the whole universe, whether animate or inanimate, would bend the knee in homage and raise its voice in praise" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Philippians 2:10</a>). The doxology which thus rises from the universe is appropriately four-fold: the definite article (omitted in the English version) must be supplied before each word ("<span class= "ital">The</span> blessing," &c.). The two preceding songs were in honour of the Lamb; in this last the praise is addressed to the Throned One and to the Lamb. This linking of the Lamb with God as the Throned One is common throughout the book. Here they are linked in praise; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm" title="And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:">Revelation 6:16</a> they are linked in wrath; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm" title="For the Lamb which is in the middle of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.">Revelation 7:17</a> they are linked in ministering consolation; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-6.htm" title="And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns.">Revelation 19:6-7</a>, they are linked in triumph. In the final vision of the book the Lord God and the Lamb are the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm" title="And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.">Revelation 21:22</a>) and the light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm" title="And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.">Revelation 21:23</a>), the refreshment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1</a>) and sovereignty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3</a>), of the celestial city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them;</span> <span class="accented">and every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things that are in them</span> (Revised Version). All animated creation now joins in the ascription of praise. Those <span class="accented">under the earth</span> are probably the <span class="accented">"spirits</span> in prison" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>, though Vitringa understands the expression to be used of the devils <span class="accented">"who</span> unwillingly obey Christ," and even declare his glory, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>, "I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God." <span class="accented">The sea</span> is meant literally; the apostle's object being to include all animated beings wheresoever existing. It has been remarked that St. John's exile at Patmos would render him familiar with the appearance of the sea, and account for its frequent use in the Apocalypse, both literally and symbolically. The things on <span class="accented">the sea</span> would signify, not merely ships with their inhabitants, but also those animals in the sea which are known to men by dwelling near the surface. "All things that are in them" serves to render emphatic the universality of the description, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a>, <span class="accented">"The</span> Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is." <span class="cmt_word">Heard I saying.</span> "Saying" is masculine, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in 10, 13, P, Vulgate, Andr. <span class="accented">a, c</span>, Arethas, Primasius. But the neuter, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is read in <span class="accented">A, 1</span>, 12, Andr. p, bay. <span class="cmt_word">Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power;</span> <span class="accented">the blessing, and the honour, and the glory, and the dominion</span> (Revised Version). The Revisers have wisely rendered <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the dominion," by a different word from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "power," of ver. 12, both of which in the Authorized Version are rendered "power." The article, too, serves to give greater emphasis, making the expression tantamount to "all blessing," etc. (see on Revelation 4:11). Nothing is signified by the omission of three attributes. The number four is symbolical of the complete creation, and may be used on that account; but probably the omission is to avoid repetition, the four attributes given being typical of the seven just previously uttered. <span class="cmt_word">Be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.</span> That is, unto the Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2). Christ, as having part with the Father and the Holy Ghost in the Godhead, sits upon the throne, and is worthy with them to receive adoration. But in his special character as the Redeemer, he is also singled out to receive the praises of the redeemed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:8-14 It is matter of joy to all the world, to see that God deals with men in grace and mercy through the Redeemer. He governs the world, not merely as a Creator, but as our Saviour. The harps were instruments of praise; the vials were full of odours, or incense, which signify the prayers of the saints: prayer and praise should always go together. Christ has redeemed his people from the bondage of sin, guilt, and Satan. He has not only purchased liberty for them, but the highest honour and preferment; he made them kings and priests; kings, to rule over their own spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he makes them priests; giving them access to himself, and liberty to offer up spiritual sacrifices. What words can more fully declare that Christ is, and ought to be worshipped, equally with the Father, by all creatures, to all eternity! Happy those who shall adore and praise in heaven, and who shall for ever bless the Lamb, who delivered and set them apart for himself by his blood. How worthy art thou, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, of our highest praises! All creatures should proclaim thy greatness, and adore thy majesty.</body></html>
