Delitzsch quotes an Arab saying: "Pursue the caught one "--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>sure to be caught.<p>The "luxury of revenge" is well expressed in this beatitude, pronounced on him who can carry out to all its bitter end the <span class= "ital">lex talionis. </span>Commentators have in turn tried to disguise and justify the expression of passion.

When suffering, we should recollect with godly sorrow our forfeited mercies, and our sins by which we lost them. If temporal advantages ever render a profession, the worst calamity has befallen him. Far be it from us to avenge ourselves; we will leave it to Him who has said, Vengeance is mine. Those that are glad at calamities, especially at the calamities of Jerusalem, shall not go unpunished. We cannot pray for promised success to the church of God without looking to, though we do not utter a prayer for, the ruin of her enemies. But let us call to mind to whose grace and finished salvation alone it is, that we have any hopes of being brought home to the heavenly Jerusalem.</body></html>
