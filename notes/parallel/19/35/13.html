The context evidently implies something done for the benefit of the whilome friends for whom, in their sickness, the poet had worn sackcloth, and had fasted and adopted all the other signs of mourning. We must therefore set aside (1) the idea of <span class= "ital">fruitless </span>prayer, in spite of the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-13.htm" title="And if the house be worthy, let your peace come on it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.">Matthew 10:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-6.htm" title="And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on it: if not, it shall turn to you again.">Luke 10:6</a>. (2) The notion that the answer to the prayer came back to the psalmist himself, instead of to those for whom it was offered, must also be set aside. And (3) we must reject the notion of secret, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>silent prayer, in spite of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-23.htm" title="A wicked man takes a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.">Proverbs 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-14.htm" title="A gift in secret pacifies anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.">Proverbs 21:14</a>, since all the "outward and visible" signs of mourning are indicated, and the very object was to show sympathy and interest.<p>There remains (1) the literal, <span class= "ital">and my prayer turned upon my bosom, </span>referring to the posture described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm" title="I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourns for his mother.">Psalm 35:14</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-42.htm" title="So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees,">1Kings 18:42</a>, where, however, there is no express mention of prayer.) The words were, as it were, muttered into his bosom. This is the view of Ewald and Delitzsch, but seems prosaic. (2)The far more probable meaning, <span class= "ital">my prayer came back again and again to my bosom, i.e., </span>was repeated over and over again; just as we say, "the thought recurred to my mind." (Comp. the common phrase for thoughts coming upon the heart, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, said the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.">Jeremiah 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, etc.) The Hebrew verb has this frequentative sense in one of its conjugations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as</span> <span class="cmt_word">for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth</span>. It is suggested that David had acted thus, especially in the case of Saul, when he was first afflicted with his terrible malady (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>); but he appears to speak of his habitual practice, whenever any of his friends were sick. (On the putting on of sackcloth as a sign of grief, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-30.htm">2 Kings 6:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-11.htm">Psalm 69:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-11.htm">Psalm 69:11</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">I humbled my soul with fasting.</span> Another customary indication of grief (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-10.htm">Psalm 69:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm">Psalm 109:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-13.htm">1 Samuel 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-12.htm">2 Samuel 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-16.htm">2 Samuel 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And my prayer returned into mine own bosom</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-13.htm">Matthew 10:13</a>). Prayers for others, if prevented by their unworthiness from benefiting them, are yet not altogether void and vain. They bring a blessing to the man that offers them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:11-16 Call a man ungrateful, and you can call him no worse: this was the character of David's enemies. Herein he was a type of Christ. David shows how tenderly he had behaved towards them in afflictions. We ought to mourn for the sins of those who do not mourn for themselves. We shall not lose by the good offices we do to any, how ungrateful soever they may be. Let us learn to possess our souls in patience and meekness like David, or rather after Christ's example.</body></html>
