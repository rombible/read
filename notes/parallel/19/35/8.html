The LXX., no doubt, are right in reading the pronouns as plurals, instead of singular. The word translated "destruction" means, primarily, a <span class= "ital">storm, </span>or the <span class= "ital">crash </span>that accompanies a storm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm" title="When your fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish comes on you.">Proverbs 1:27</a>), and if with the Syriac we might supply a clause, both parallelism and sense would be complete.<p>"Let men come upon him (them) unexpectedly.<p>Let the net which he had catch himself,<p>The pit which he (they) digged, let him (them) fall into it,<p>In ruin let him (them) fall into it."<p>For "unawares," see margin and Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-12.htm" title="Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.">Song of Solomon 6:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let destruction come upon him at unawares</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let the evil happen to him that he designed against others. As he sought to catch others in traps of which they knew nothing (ver. 7), so let an unexpected destruction come upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And let his net that he hath hid catch himself</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a>). It is the perfection of poetic justice when "the engineer" is "hoist by his own petard." <span class="cmt_word">Into that very destruction lot him fall</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for destruction let him fall therein</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let him not only fall into his own trap, but let his fall prove his destruction. David's imprecations have always something about them from which the Christian shrinks; and this is particularly the case when he asks for his enemies' <span class="accented">destruction.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:1-10 It is no new thing for the most righteous men, and the most righteous cause, to meet with enemies. This is a fruit of the old enmity in the seed of the serpent against the Seed of the woman. David in his afflictions, Christ in his sufferings, the church under persecution, and the Christian in the hour temptation, all beseech the Almighty to appear in their behalf, and to vindicate their cause. We are apt to justify uneasiness at the injuries men do us, by our never having given them cause to use us so ill; but this should make us easy, for then we may the more expect that God will plead our cause. David prayed to God to manifest himself in his trial. Let me have inward comfort under all outward troubles, to support my soul. If God, by his Spirit, witness to our spirits that he is our salvation, we need desire no more to make us happy. If God is our Friend, no matter who is our enemy. By the Spirit of prophecy, David foretells the just judgments of God that would come upon his enemies for their great wickedness. These are predictions, they look forward, and show the doom of the enemies of Christ and his kingdom. We must not desire or pray for the ruin of any enemies, except our lusts and the evil spirits that would compass our destruction. A traveller benighted in a bad road, is an expressive emblem of a sinner walking in the slippery and dangerous ways of temptation. But David having committed his cause to God, did not doubt of his own deliverance. The bones are the strongest parts of the body. The psalmist here proposes to serve and glorify God with all his strength. If such language may be applied to outward salvation, how much more will it apply to heavenly things in Christ Jesus!</body></html>
