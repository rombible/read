This they will do, partly, out of sympathy; partly because their own interests are bound up with those of their leader. Had Saul captured David when he "hunted him upon the mountains," the fate of David's followers would have been death or exile. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the peace of his servant.</span> God desires that David's present troubles should cease, and that he should enjoy a time of rest and tranquillity. This was granted him, to some extent, at Ziklag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-4.htm">1 Samuel 27:4-7</a>), but more fully when he came into his kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:17-28 Though the people of God are, and study to be, quiet, yet it has been common for their enemies to devise deceitful matters against them. David prays, My soul is in danger, Lord, rescue it; it belongs to thee the Father of spirits, therefore claim thine own; it is thine, save it! Lord, be not far from me, as if I were a stranger. He who exalted the once suffering Redeemer, will appear for all his people: the roaring lion shall not destroy their souls, any more than he could that of Christ, their Surety. They trust their souls in his hands, they are one with him by faith, are precious in his sight, and shall be rescued from destruction, that they may give thanks in heaven.</body></html>
