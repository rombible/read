The LXX. and Vulg. have, "they tempted me, they mocked me with a mocking"; Symmachus, "in hypocrisy, with feigned words"; Chaldee, "with derisive words of flattery." All these take the word rendered in the Authorised Version, "feasts," as a cognate of a word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-11.htm" title="For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.">Isaiah 28:11</a>, translated "stammering," but which means rather, "barbarisms." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-19.htm" title="You shall not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than you can perceive; of a stammering tongue, that you can not understand.">Isaiah 33:19</a>.) The word rendered "hypocritical" more properly means "profane" or "impious." With these meanings we <span class= "ital">get </span>a very good sense (with evident reference to the malicious attacks of foreigners, or of the anti-national party that affected foreign ways) <span class= "ital">in the manner of profane barbaric barbarisms, </span>or <span class= "ital">with profanity and barbarism.</span><p>As to the rendering "feasts," it comes from treating the word as the same used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-13.htm" title="And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go and do as you have said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it to me, and after make for you and for your son.">1Kings 17:13</a>) for a "cake." "Cake-mockers" are explained to be parasites who hang about the tables of the rich, getting their dinner in return for their buffooneries.
