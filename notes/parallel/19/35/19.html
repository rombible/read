But after this it becomes mainly positive: "Stir up thyself, and awake to judgment" (ver. 23); "Judge me, O Lord" (ver. 24); "Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that rejoice at my hurt" (ver. 26); "Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause" (ver. 27); "Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in my prosperity" (ver. 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-19.htm">Psalm 38:19</a>, where David says that those who "hated him wrongfully" were "multiplied").

He who exalted the once suffering Redeemer, will appear for all his people: the roaring lion shall not destroy their souls, any more than he could that of Christ, their Surety. They trust their souls in his hands, they are one with him by faith, are precious in his sight, and shall be rescued from destruction, that they may give thanks in heaven.</body></html>
