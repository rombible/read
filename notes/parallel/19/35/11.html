It is not probable that witnesses in a court are intended. David's calumniators accused him privately to Saul of "seeking his hurt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-9.htm">1 Samuel 24:9</a>), and so stirred Saul up against him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a>). By what is here said, they appear to have accused him to his face, and to have endeavoured to extort from him a confession of guilt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/35.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>35:11-16 Call a man ungrateful, and you can call him no worse: this was the character of David's enemies. Herein he was a type of Christ. David shows how tenderly he had behaved towards them in afflictions. We ought to mourn for the sins of those who do not mourn for themselves. We shall not lose by the good offices we do to any, how ungrateful soever they may be. Let us learn to possess our souls in patience and meekness like David, or rather after Christ's example.</body></html>
