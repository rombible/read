This anticipates, but only in form, the modern scientific doctrine of the inviolability of natural order. It is the imperishable faithfulness of God that renders the law invariable. See the remarkable passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-36.htm" title="If those ordinances depart from before me, said the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.">Jeremiah 31:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-20.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;">Jeremiah 33:20</a>, from winch we conclude that a covenant was supposed to have been made between God and nature as between Jehovah and Israel, the one being as imperishable as the other. A comparison of the two passages referred to shows that the Hebrew words <span class= "ital">ordinance </span>and <span class= "ital">covenant </span>might be used synonymously. The Authorised Version, which, following the LXX. and Vulg., makes the ordinance itself imperishable, violates the usage of the Hebrew verb.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/148.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath also established them forever and ever</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>).

They are always praising God, therefore the psalmist shows his desire that God may be praised in the best manner; also we show that we have communion with spirits above, who are still praising him. The heavens, with all contained in them, declare the glory of God. They call on us, that both by word and deed, we glorify with them the Creator and Redeemer of the universe.</body></html>
