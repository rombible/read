He will spend the whole day in telling of God's righteousness and salvation (ver. 15). The mighty acts of the Lord shall form his theme, together with the righteousness of God, and of none other (ver. 16). As God has enabled him to declare his praise in the past (ver. 17), so he trusts to be still upheld and enabled to proclaim the same to the new generation (ver. 18). God's righteousness is "very high," and there is none like him (ver. 19). When he. brings men into trouble, it is only to "turn again and comfort them" (vers. 20, 21). In conclusion, the writer promises that his hymns of praise shall not only be said, but sung, and accompanied with the melody of music (ver. 22). His lips and soul shall both rejoice together (ver. 23); and the praise of God shall employ his tongue without ceasing (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I will hope continually</span>; literally, <span class="accented">but as for me, I</span> <span class="accented">will hope</span>, etc. The phrase, "as for me," almost always marks a transition. <span class="cmt_word">And will yet praise thee more and more;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will add to all thy praise; i.e.</span> "I will add to all my past praises of thee further praises in the future." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/71.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>71:14-24 The psalmist declares that the righteousness of Christ, and the great salvation obtained thereby, shall be the chosen subject of his discourse. Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of the year, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, but on every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.</body></html>
