At the time of Adonijah's rebellion, David was "old and stricken in years" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-1.htm">1 Kings 1:1</a>) - nearly, if not quite, seventy years of age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Until I have showed thy strength</span> (literally, <span class="accented">thine own</span>) <span class="cmt_word">unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come</span>. The psalmist calls on God to sustain him in his old age, not for his own sake, but that he may impress on the rising generation God's might and marvellous acts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/71.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>71:14-24 The psalmist declares that the righteousness of Christ, and the great salvation obtained thereby, shall be the chosen subject of his discourse. Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of the year, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, but on every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.</body></html>
