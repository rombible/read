An undivided will is in morals and religion equally essential.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/86.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-17.</span> - The third strophe is almost equally divided between prayer and praise, vers. 11, 16, and 17 being devoted to the one; and vers. 12, 13, and 15 to the other. Ver. 14 is of the nature of a complaint. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-33.htm">Psalm 119:33</a>). Man cannot know "the way of the Lord," unless he is taught of God. The inward anointing of the Spirit is needful to teach us what God would really have us do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27</a>). It is only when we are thus taught that we can "walk in his truth." <span class="cmt_word">Unite my heart to fear thy Name.</span> So Symmachus, who has <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; Canon Cook, Dr. Kay, Hupfeld, Professor Alexander, and the Revised Version.

But the textual reading has the weight of authority in its favour, and gives an excellent sense, "Bring all my heart into unison, that it may be wholly fixed on thee." Compare the following verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/86.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>86:8-17 Our God alone possesses almighty power and infinite love. Christ is the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth of God, in order to walk therein, than to be delivered out of earthly distress. Those who set not the Lord before them, seek after believers' souls; but the compassion, mercy, and truth of God, will be their refuge and consolation. And those whose parents were the servants of the Lord, may urge this as a plea why he should hear and help them. In considering David's experience, and that of the believer, we must not lose sight of Him, who though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.</body></html>
