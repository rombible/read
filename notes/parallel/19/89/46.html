How long is God's wrath to endure? Will he not remember how weak and futile, how short-lived and fleeting, the whole race of man is? Well he not bethink him of his old loving kindnesses to David, and of the promises made to him, and confirmed by oath? Will he not therefore remove their reproach from Israel, and especially from his anointed, on whom the disgrace chiefly falls? To these questions there can be but one answer. God will assuredly make his faithfulness known (see ver. 1). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How long, Lord? wilt thou hide thyself forever;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-10.htm">Psalm 74:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall thy wrath burn like fire?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> furiously, without cessation, till all be consumed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/89.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>89:38-52 Sometimes it is not easy to reconcile God's providences with his promises, yet we are sure that God's works fulfil his word. When the great Anointed One, Christ himself, was upon the cross, God seemed to have cast him off, yet did not make void his covenant, for that was established for ever. The honour of the house of David was lost. Thrones and crowns are often laid in the dust; but there is a crown of glory reserved for Christ's spiritual seed, which fadeth not away. From all this complaint learn what work sin makes with families, noble families, with families in which religion has appeared. They plead with God for mercy. God's unchangeableness and faithfulness assure us that He will not cast off those whom he has chosen and covenanted with. They were reproached for serving him. The scoffers of the latter days, in like manner, reproach the footsteps of the Messiah when they ask, Where is the promise of his coming? 2Pe 3:3,4. The records of the Lord's dealings with the family of David, show us his dealings with his church, and with believers. Their afflictions and distresses may be grievous, but he will not finally cast them off. Self-deceivers abuse this doctrine, and others by a careless walk bring themselves into darkness and distress; yet let the true believer rely on it for encouragement in the path of duty, and in bearing the cross. The psalm ends with praise, even after this sad complaint. Those who give God thanks for what he has done, may give him thanks for what he will do. God will follow those with his mercies, who follow him with praises.</body></html>
