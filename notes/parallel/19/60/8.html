Others explain, from analogy of Arabic proverbs, that the conqueror would as it were wash his face white, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>acquire renown in Moab.<p>Possibly the comparison of Moab to a bath was suggested by its proximity to the Dead Sea, which might be said to be at the foot of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">Over Edom . . .</span>--The most natural explanation of this figure is that Edom is disgraced to the character of the slave to whom the conqueror tosses his sandals (<span class= "ital">na'al </span>is collective), that they may be cleaned. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>). The symbolic action of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-7.htm" title="Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.">Ruth 4:7</a> had a different meaning, the transfer of a right of ownership, and so cannot be employed in illustration.<p>Of the "shoe," as a figure of what is vilest and most common, Dr. J. G. Wetzstein quotes many Arabic proverbs. A covering for the feet would naturally draw to it such associations. (Comp. the use of footstool repeatedly in the Psalms, and Shakespeare's use of foot,<p>"What my foot my tutor!"--<span class= "ital">Tempest.</span>)<p>But the custom which Israel brought from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-3.htm" title="And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.">Exodus 3:3</a>), of dropping the sandals outside the door of a temple, and even of an ordinary house, must have served still more to fasten on that article of dress, ideas of vileness and profanation.<p><span class= "bld">Philistia, triumph thou because of me . . .</span>--This cannot be the meaning intended by the clause, since it is quite out of keeping with the context, and in Psalms 108 we have the very opposite, "over Philistia will I triumph." We must therefore change this reading so as to get, <span class= "ital">over Philistia is my triumph, </span>or render the text as it stands, from analogy with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm" title="And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even to Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous to him.">Isaiah 15:4</a> : <span class= "ital">Upon </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., because of</span>)<span class= "ital"> me, Philistia, raise a mournful wail.</span><p>The LXX. and Vulg. indicate this meaning while translating the proper name, "the foreigners have been subdued to me."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moab is my washpot.</span> A term of extreme contempt (see Herod., 2:172). The subjugation of Moab was prophesied by Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), and effected by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Over Edom will I cast out my shoe</span>. The reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-7.htm">Ruth 4:7, 8</a>, which is commonly made, is very doubtful. Probably no more is intended than that Edom will be a slave of so low a rank as only to clean the shoes of its master. The subjugation of Edom, like that of Moab, had been prophesied by Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Philistia, triumph thou because of me.</span> The context will not allow of this rendering, since Philistia, like the other enemies of Israel, must be triumphed over, and not triumph. Translate, <span class="accented">over Philistia is my triumphing</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-9.htm">Psalm 108:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/60.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>60:6-12 If Christ be ours, all things, one way or another, shall be for our eternal good. The man who is a new creature in Christ, may rejoice in all the precious promises God has spoken in his holiness. His present privileges, and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit, are sure earnests of heavenly glory. David rejoices in conquering the neighbouring nations, which had been enemies to Israel. The Israel of God are through Christ more than conquerors. Though sometimes they think that the Lord has cast them off, yet he will bring them into the strong city at last. Faith in the promise will assure us that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom: But we are not yet made complete conquerors, and no true believer will abuse these truths to indulge sloth, or vain confidence. Hope in God is the best principle of true courage, for what need those fear who have God on their side? All our victories are from him, and while those who willingly submit to our anointed King shall share his glories, all his foes shall be put under his feet.</body></html>
