This is the poet's question. He may be a king himself eager for triumph, or more probably Israel personified. (See the plural in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/60-10.htm" title="Will not you, O God, which had cast us off? and you, O God, which did not go out with our armies?">Psalm 60:10-12</a>.) Edom is the particular foe in view, and as the difficulties of the undertaking present themselves, misgivings arise and the assurance gained from the triumphs of olden time turns into prayer, half plaintive, half confident, that the Divine favour and power may be once more on the side of the chosen people.<p><span class= "bld">The strong city.</span>--As in the Hebrew the article is wanting, any strongly fortified city might be intended, were it not for the parallelism. Here it must stand for <span class= "ital">Selah </span>or <span class= "ital">Petra, </span>the capital of Edom. For its impregnable position (see Note <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-3.htm" title="The pride of your heart has deceived you, you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that said in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?">Obadiah 1:3</a>). The question, "Who will lead me into Petra?" is explained by the fact that there are only two possible approaches to the city, each a long narrow tortuous defile, and that the place itself is so buried in its ravines that it cannot be seen from any spot in its neighbourhood far or near.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9-12.</span> - Rehearsal of God's promises has raised the psalmist out of despondency, and he can now confidently call God to his assistance. Edom is to be conquered, for so God has premised (ver. 8). But how? Who will lead out Israel's armies? Will God, who has lately "cast Israel off"? If not, it must he man. But "vain is the help of man" (ver. 11). So the call is made that God will give help in the trouble - and with the call comes full confidence - and the triumphant cry goes forth, "Through God we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall tread down our enemies" (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who will bring me into the strong city?</span> The "strong city" of Edom was Sela, "The Cliff" - now Petra. And it was a city of enormous strength, rock hewn in the main, and guarded by frightful precipices. Who will conduct me through its strong natural and artificial defences, and give me possession of the place? <span class="cmt_word">Who will lead me into Edom?</span> Who will even bring me into the country? The Edomites, flushed with their recent victory, will, of course, dispute my entrance. Who will enable me to overcome their resistance? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/60.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>60:6-12 If Christ be ours, all things, one way or another, shall be for our eternal good. The man who is a new creature in Christ, may rejoice in all the precious promises God has spoken in his holiness. His present privileges, and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit, are sure earnests of heavenly glory. David rejoices in conquering the neighbouring nations, which had been enemies to Israel. The Israel of God are through Christ more than conquerors. Though sometimes they think that the Lord has cast them off, yet he will bring them into the strong city at last. Faith in the promise will assure us that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom: But we are not yet made complete conquerors, and no true believer will abuse these truths to indulge sloth, or vain confidence. Hope in God is the best principle of true courage, for what need those fear who have God on their side? All our victories are from him, and while those who willingly submit to our anointed King shall share his glories, all his foes shall be put under his feet.</body></html>
