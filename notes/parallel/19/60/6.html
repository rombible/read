Shechem and Succoth appear to be named as a rude indication of the whole breadth of the country, from west to east. The fact that Dr. Robinson and Vandervelde have identified one Succoth on the right bank of Jordan, does not at all weaken the evidence for the existence of another on the east of that river. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm" title="And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.">Genesis 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-5.htm" title="And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.">Judges 8:5</a> <span class= "ital">seq.; </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm" title="Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,">Joshua 13:17</a> (where <span class= "ital">?mek </span>is used for valley, as here).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - Appeal is next made in God's promises. Some suppose that a Divine oracle had been recently given to David himself, and that he here records the words of it. But, in that case, it is difficult to account for the despondent tone of vers. 1-4. Hengstenberg's explanation seems preferable, that David now encourages himself by a "reference to the general aspect of the assurances given in the Pentateuch in regard to the possession of the land of Canaan in its widest extent, and to victory over hostile neighbours," and that he has his eye especially on the blessing of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>) and the blessing of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>). If these assurances are to be depended on, Israel cannot now be about to succumb to Edom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God hath spoken in his holiness;</span> or, <span class="accented">promised by his holiness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-35.htm">Psalm 89:35</a>).

God, having assigned the whole laud to his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14, 15</a>), "meted it out" through Joshua, his servant, and gave to each tribe its inheritance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/60.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>60:6-12 If Christ be ours, all things, one way or another, shall be for our eternal good. The man who is a new creature in Christ, may rejoice in all the precious promises God has spoken in his holiness. His present privileges, and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit, are sure earnests of heavenly glory. David rejoices in conquering the neighbouring nations, which had been enemies to Israel. The Israel of God are through Christ more than conquerors. Though sometimes they think that the Lord has cast them off, yet he will bring them into the strong city at last. Faith in the promise will assure us that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom: But we are not yet made complete conquerors, and no true believer will abuse these truths to indulge sloth, or vain confidence. Hope in God is the best principle of true courage, for what need those fear who have God on their side? All our victories are from him, and while those who willingly submit to our anointed King shall share his glories, all his foes shall be put under his feet.</body></html>
