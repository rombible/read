But the ancient rendering, recently revived by Professor Cheyne, is perhaps preferable. According to this, the meaning is, "Thou hast indeed given a banner to them that fear thee (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>), but only that they may flee before the bow" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1ffd;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.). On the last occasion that the banner had been lifted, it had seemed to be, not so much a rallying point, as a signal for dispersion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/60.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>60:1-5 David owns God's displeasure to be the cause of all the hardships he had undergone. And when God is turning his hand in our favour, it is good to remember our former troubles. In God's displeasure their troubles began, therefore in his favour their prosperity must begin. Those breaches and divisions which the folly and corruption of man make, nothing but the wisdom and grace of God can repair, by pouring out a spirit of love and peace, by which only a kingdom is saved from ruin. The anger of God against sin, is the only cause of all misery, private or public, that has been, is, or shall be. In all these cases there is no remedy, but by returning to the Lord with repentance, faith, and prayer; beseeching him to return to us. Christ, the Son of David, is given for a banner to those that fear God; in him they are gathered together in one, and take courage. In his name and strength they wage war with the powers of darkness.</body></html>
