The ungodly having been threatened, a promise of assistance is made to the righteous whom they oppress. God declares that, in response to the many calls made upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>), he will "now," at last, "arise" - interpose on behalf of the oppressed, and deliver them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him</span>. This is a possible meaning; but it is perhaps better to render, with Hengstenberg and Cheyne, "I will place him in the safety for which he sighs," or "pants." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 The psalmist begs help of God, because there were none among men whom he durst trust. - This psalm furnishes good thoughts for bad times; a man may comfort himself with such meditations and prayers. Let us see what makes the times bad, and when they may be said to be so. Ask the children of this world, What makes the times bad? they will tell you, Scarcity of money, decay of trade, and the desolations of war, make the times bad: but the Scripture lays the badness of the times on causes of another nature, 2Ti 3:1, c.: perilous times shall come, for sin shall abound; and of this David complains. When piety decays times really are bad. He who made man's mouth will call him to an account for his proud, profane, dissembling, or even useless words. When the poor and needy are oppressed, then the times are very bad. God himself takes notice of the oppression of the poor, and the sighing of the needy. When wickedness abounds, and is countenanced by those in authority, then the times are very bad. See with what good things we are here furnished for such bad times; and we cannot tell what times we may be reserved for. 1. We have a God to go to, from whom we may ask and expect the redress of all our grievances. 2. God will certainly punish and restrain false and proud men. 3. God will work deliverance for his oppressed people. His help is given in the fittest time. Though men are false, God is faithful; though they are not to be trusted, God is. The preciousness of God's word is compared to silver refined to the highest degree. How many proofs have been given of its power and truth! God will secure his chosen remnant, however bad the times are. As long as the world stands, there will be a generation of proud and wicked men. But all God's people are put into the hands of Christ our Saviour; there they are in safety, for none can pluck them thence; being built on Him, the Rock, they are safe, notwithstanding temptation or persecution come with ever so much force upon them.</body></html>
