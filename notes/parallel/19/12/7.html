God having promised to set the righteous, who are oppressed, in a place of safety (ver. 5), the psalmist is sure that he will keep them and preserve them from the wicked "generation," which has possession of the earth, and bears rule in it, <span class="accented">always.</span> It is, no doubt, for the greater consolation and encouragement of these unfortunates that he dwells on the subject, and adds his own assurances to the Divine promise which he has recorded. Man's faith is so weak that, unless promises and assurances are reiterated, they make little impression. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt preserve them</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">him</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>from this generation for ever</span>. The "generation" is that of the worldly men in power at the time, of whom we have heard in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1, 2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-4.htm">Psalm 5:4-6, 9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-1.htm">Psalm 7:1, 2, 9, 13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2-11, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2, 3, 6</a>. "For ever" means "so long as they live." The substitution of "him' for "them" in this clause is an instance of that generalization by which a whole class is summed up in a single individual - " all men" in "man," "all good men" in "the righteous" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;</span>), and the like. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 The psalmist begs help of God, because there were none among men whom he durst trust. - This psalm furnishes good thoughts for bad times; a man may comfort himself with such meditations and prayers. Let us see what makes the times bad, and when they may be said to be so. Ask the children of this world, What makes the times bad? they will tell you, Scarcity of money, decay of trade, and the desolations of war, make the times bad: but the Scripture lays the badness of the times on causes of another nature, 2Ti 3:1, c.: perilous times shall come, for sin shall abound; and of this David complains. When piety decays times really are bad. He who made man's mouth will call him to an account for his proud, profane, dissembling, or even useless words. When the poor and needy are oppressed, then the times are very bad. God himself takes notice of the oppression of the poor, and the sighing of the needy. When wickedness abounds, and is countenanced by those in authority, then the times are very bad. See with what good things we are here furnished for such bad times; and we cannot tell what times we may be reserved for. 1. We have a God to go to, from whom we may ask and expect the redress of all our grievances. 2. God will certainly punish and restrain false and proud men. 3. God will work deliverance for his oppressed people. His help is given in the fittest time. Though men are false, God is faithful; though they are not to be trusted, God is. The preciousness of God's word is compared to silver refined to the highest degree. How many proofs have been given of its power and truth! God will secure his chosen remnant, however bad the times are. As long as the world stands, there will be a generation of proud and wicked men. But all God's people are put into the hands of Christ our Saviour; there they are in safety, for none can pluck them thence; being built on Him, the Rock, they are safe, notwithstanding temptation or persecution come with ever so much force upon them.</body></html>
