The LXX. and Vulg. have apparently thought of the bursting out of a fountain: <span class= "ital">eructavit. </span>Symmachus has, "been set in motion." The "spring," or "fountain," is a common emblem of inspired fancy:--<p>"Ancient <span class= "ital">founts </span>of inspiration <span class= "ital">well </span>through all my fancy yet."<p>TENNYSON: <span class= "ital">Locksley Hall.</span><p><span class= "bld">A good matter.</span>--That is, a theme worthy a poet's song.

Perhaps, however, we are to understand Aquila and Symmachus as rendering "my poems;" and undoubtedly the true rendering is, <span class= "ital">I am speaking: my poem is of a king </span>(not <span class= "ital">the </span>king, as in Authorised Version).<p><span class= "bld">My tongue . . .</span>--So lofty a theme, so august a subject, inspires him with thoughts that flow freely. The <span class= "ital">ready </span>or <span class= "ital">expeditious scribe </span>(LXX. and Vulg., "A scribe writing quickly") was, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm" title="This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God on him.">Ezra 7:6</a>, a recognised form of praise for a distinguished member of that body, one of whose functions was to make copies of the Law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My heart is inditing a good matter</span>; literally, <span class="accented">bubbleth with a good matter</span> - is so full of it that the matter will burst forth. <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">speak of the things which I have made touching the king</span>; or, I <span class="accented">utter that which I have composed concerning the king. <span class="cmt_word"></span>My tongue is the pen of a ready writer</span>. It is noted that only "psalms of high and solemn import" have formal exordia of this kind, announcing the intention of the writer. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-5 The psalmist's tongue was guided by the Spirit of God, as the pen is by the hand of a ready writer. This psalm is touching the King Jesus, his kingdom and government. It is a shame that this good matter is not more the subject of our discourse. There is more in Christ to engage our love, than there is or can be in any creature. This world and its charms are ready to draw away our hearts from Christ; therefore we are concerned to understand how much more worthy he is of our love. By his word, his promise, his gospel, the good will of God is made known to us, and the good work of God is begun and carried on in us. The psalmist, ver. 3-5, joyfully foretells the progress and success of the Messiah. The arrows of conviction are very terrible in the hearts of sinners, till they are humbled and reconciled; but the arrows of vengeance will be more so to his enemies who refuse to submit. All who have seen his glory and tasted his grace, rejoice to see him, by his word and Spirit, bring enemies and strangers under his dominion.</body></html>
