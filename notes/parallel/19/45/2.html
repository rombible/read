Cicero, himself the grandest example of his own expression, says of another that "Persuasion had her seat upon his lips;" while Christian commentators have all naturally thought of Him at whose "words of grace" all men wondered.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore.</span>--This word is apparently out of place.

Ewald seems to be right in printing the clause so begun as a kind of refrain. The poet enumerates in detail the beauties of the monarch and his bride, and is interrupted by the acclaim of his hearers, who cannot withhold their approving voices.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art fairer than the children of men</span>. It has been argued that a description of the Messiah would not lay stress on his personal beauty. But in the Song of Songs the personal beauty of the bridegroom, whom so many critics regard as the Messiah, is a main point (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-10.htm">Song of Solomon 5:10-16</a>). A perfect man, such as Messiah was to be, must needs be beautiful, at any rate with a beauty of expression. In calling his bridegroom "<span class="accented">fair beyond the sons of men</span>," the writer at once gives us to understand that he is not a mere man. Grace is poured into thy lips; rather, <span class="accented">grace is poured out on thy lips</span> (Hengstenberg, Cheyne, Kay). The gift of gracious expression and gracious speech has been poured upon him from on high (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-16.htm">Song of Solomon 5:16</a>, "His mouth is most sweet"). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</span> The gifts bestowed upon him show the Divine favor and blessing, which, once granted, are not capriciously withdrawn. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:1-5 The psalmist's tongue was guided by the Spirit of God, as the pen is by the hand of a ready writer. This psalm is touching the King Jesus, his kingdom and government. It is a shame that this good matter is not more the subject of our discourse. There is more in Christ to engage our love, than there is or can be in any creature. This world and its charms are ready to draw away our hearts from Christ; therefore we are concerned to understand how much more worthy he is of our love. By his word, his promise, his gospel, the good will of God is made known to us, and the good work of God is begun and carried on in us. The psalmist, ver. 3-5, joyfully foretells the progress and success of the Messiah. The arrows of conviction are very terrible in the hearts of sinners, till they are humbled and reconciled; but the arrows of vengeance will be more so to his enemies who refuse to submit. All who have seen his glory and tasted his grace, rejoice to see him, by his word and Spirit, bring enemies and strangers under his dominion.</body></html>
