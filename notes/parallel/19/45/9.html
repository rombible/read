The marriage scene now begins to open upon us. The bridegroom has been depicted in all his glorious majesty. The bride has now to be brought forward. She comes, accompanied by a train of attendants - "honourable women," or, noble ladies" (Kay), many of whom are "kings' daughters" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-3.htm">1 Kings 7:3</a>).

"Gold of Ophir" was known, not merely to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-4.htm">1 Chronicles 29:4</a>), but even to Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>). The "right hand" of the king was the place of honour. We find it assigned by Solomon to the queen-mother, Bathsheba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:6-9 The throne of this almighty King is established for ever. While the Holy Spirit leads Christ's people to look to his cross, he teaches them to see the evil of sin and the beauty of holiness; so that none of them can feel encouragement to continue in sin. The Mediator is God, else he had been neither able to do the Mediator's work, nor fit to wear the Mediator's crown. God the Father, as his God in respect to his human nature and mediatorial offices, has given to him the Holy Spirit without measure. Thus anointed to be a Prophet, Priest, and King, Christ has pre-eminence in the gladdening gifts and graces of the spirit, and from his fulness communicates them to his brethren in human nature. The Spirit is called the oil of gladness, because of the delight wherewith Christ was filled, in carrying on his undertakings. The salvation of sinners is the joy of angels, much more of the Son. And in proportion as we are conformed to his holy image, we may expect the gladdening gifts influences of the Comforter. The excellences of the Messiah, the suitableness of his offices, and the sufficiency of his grace, seem to be intended by the fragrance of his garments. The church formed of true believers, is here compared to the queen, whom, by an everlasting covenant, the Lord Jesus has betrothed to himself. This is the bride, the Lamb's wife, whose graces are compared to fine linen, for their purity; to gold, for their costliness: for as we owe our redemption, so we owe our adorning, to the precious blood of the Son of God.</body></html>
