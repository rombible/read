But whether they supposed the words to be addressed to the Divine Being, or that the theocratic king is thus styled, is uncertain. The Christian use of the verse as applied to the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm" title="But to the Son he said, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.">Hebrews 1:8</a>, Note, <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary</span>) does not help us to explain how the monarch, who is the poet's theme here, could be addressed as God. The use of <span class= "ital">Elohim </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm" title="I have said, You are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.">Psalm 82:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a>, hardly offers a satisfactory parallel, and even <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-13.htm" title="And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.">1Samuel 28:13</a> (where we should render, "I saw a <span class= "ital">god, </span>&c) hardly prepares us to find such an emphatic ascription to an earthly king, especially in an <span class= "ital">Elohistic </span>psalm. Two alternative renderings present themselves--(1) Thy throne of God is for ever <span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>thy divine throne. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm" title="Bow down your ear to me; deliver me speedily: be you my strong rock, for an house of defense to save me.">Psalm 31:2</a>, "thy refuge of strength.") (2) Thy throne is of God for ever, which is grammatically preferable, and with which may be compared <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-23.htm" title="Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.">1Chronicles 29:23</a>, "the throne of the Lord."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy throne, O God</span>. So the LXX., the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>), the Chaldee paraphrase, and, among critics, Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Alexander, and Canon Cook. The renderings proposed by Gesenius, Ewald, and the anti-Messianic school generally are wholly untenable, as Hengstenberg has clearly shown. The psalmist's intention is to address the King, whom he has already declared to be more than man (ver. 2), as "God." <span class="cmt_word">Is for ever and ever</span>. A dominion to which there will never be any end. This is never said, and could not be truly said, of any earthly kingdom. When perpetuity is promised to the throne of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4, 36, 37</a>), it is to that throne as continued in the reign of David's Son, Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">sceptre of rectitude</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-4.htm">Psalm 67:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/45.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>45:6-9 The throne of this almighty King is established for ever. While the Holy Spirit leads Christ's people to look to his cross, he teaches them to see the evil of sin and the beauty of holiness; so that none of them can feel encouragement to continue in sin. The Mediator is God, else he had been neither able to do the Mediator's work, nor fit to wear the Mediator's crown. God the Father, as his God in respect to his human nature and mediatorial offices, has given to him the Holy Spirit without measure. Thus anointed to be a Prophet, Priest, and King, Christ has pre-eminence in the gladdening gifts and graces of the spirit, and from his fulness communicates them to his brethren in human nature. The Spirit is called the oil of gladness, because of the delight wherewith Christ was filled, in carrying on his undertakings. The salvation of sinners is the joy of angels, much more of the Son. And in proportion as we are conformed to his holy image, we may expect the gladdening gifts influences of the Comforter. The excellences of the Messiah, the suitableness of his offices, and the sufficiency of his grace, seem to be intended by the fragrance of his garments. The church formed of true believers, is here compared to the queen, whom, by an everlasting covenant, the Lord Jesus has betrothed to himself. This is the bride, the Lamb's wife, whose graces are compared to fine linen, for their purity; to gold, for their costliness: for as we owe our redemption, so we owe our adorning, to the precious blood of the Son of God.</body></html>
