According to some, the whole poem is essentially a harvest thanksgiving, and the poet now "comes at last to the point aimed at from the first." He traces the whole process by which the glorious termination is arrived at. First, the "early rain" descending from "the river of God," or the reservoir for rain which God guards in the heavens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-37.htm">Job 38:37</a>), moistening the furrows, softening the ridges, and preparing the land for the seed-corn. Then the sowing, which, being man's work, is but just touched on (ver. 9, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). After that, the "latter rain" - the gentle showers of March and April - which cause the grain to burst and the blade to spring, and the ear to form itself, and turn the dull fallow into a mass of greenery (vers. 10, 12). At last, the full result - pastures clothed with flocks; valleys, the "long broad sweeps between parallel ranges of hills," covered over with corn; all nature laughing and shouting for joy (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). Thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God. There is no "with" in the original; and the two clauses are better taken separately. Translate, Thou greatly <span class="accented">enrichest it; the river of God is full of water.</span> By "the river of God" is to be understood God's store of water in the clouds and atmosphere, which he can at any time retain or let loose. Thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it; rather, <span class="accented">when thou hast so prepared her</span> (the earth). By thus preparing the earth for the sowing. God prepares for men the corn which they ultimately obtain at the harvest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:6-13 That Almighty strength which sets fast the mountains, upholds the believer. That word which stills the stormy ocean, and speaks it into a calm, can silence our enemies. How contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, it is hard to say which is most welcome. Does the watchman wait for the morning? so does the labourer earnestly desire the shades of evening. Some understand it of the morning and evening sacrifices. We are to look upon daily worship, both alone and with our families, to be the most needful of our daily occupations, the most delightful of our daily comforts. How much the fruitfulness of this lower part of the creation depends upon the influence of the upper, is easy to observe; every good and perfect gift is from above. He who enriches the earth, which is filled with man's sins, by his abundant and varied bounty, can neither want power nor will to feed the souls of his people. Temporal mercies to us unworthy creatures, shadow forth more important blessings. The rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring forth of the influences of the Holy Spirit, that river of God, full of the waters of life and salvation, render the hard, barren, worthless hearts of sinners fruitful in every good work, and change the face of nations more than the sun and rain change the face of nature. Wherever the Lord passes, by his preached gospel, attended by his Holy Spirit, his paths drop fatness, and numbers are taught to rejoice in and praise him. They will descend upon the pastures of the wilderness, all the earth shall hear and embrace the gospel, and bring forth abundantly the fruits of righteousness which are, through Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father. Manifold and marvellous, O Lord, are thy works, whether of nature or of grace; surely in loving-kindness hast thou made them all.</body></html>
