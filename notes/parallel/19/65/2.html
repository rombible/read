But we must not let what was, in the Divine providence, a fulfilment of the psalmist's words, hide their intention as it was conscious to himself. The psalm shows us the exclusiveness of Hebrew belief, and, at the same time, the nobler and grander feelings which are from time to time found struggling against it. The peculiar privilege of Israel has been stated in the first verse. Silent, yet confident, waiting for Jehovah's blessing, and then exultant praise for it (<span class= "ital">Tehillah</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>In this the other nations have no part; but all flesh may approach Jehovah in prayer (<span class= "ital">Tephillah</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>(Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm" title="By terrible things in righteousness will you answer us, O God of our salvation; who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off on the sea:">Psalm 65:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O thou that hearest prayer.</span> A necessary and inalienable attribute of God. Calvin rightly observes on the passage: "God can no more divest himself of his attribute of hearing prayer than of being." <span class="cmt_word">Unto thee shall all flesh come</span>. "All flesh" <span class="accented">might</span> certainly, in a psalmist's mouth, mean no more than "all Israel" (so Ewald and Hitzig). But the context (especially in vers. 5 and 8) shows that in <span class="accented">this</span> psalm the writer is universalist in his ideas, and embraces all mankind in his hopes and aspirations (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-9.htm">Psalm 86:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/65.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>65:1-5 All the praise the Lord receives from this earth is from Zion, being the fruit of the Spirit of Christ, and acceptable through him. Praise is silent unto thee, as wanting words to express the great goodness of God. He reveals himself upon a mercy-seat, ready to hear and answer the prayers of all who come unto him by faith in Jesus Christ. Our sins prevail against us; we cannot pretend to balance them with any righteousness of our own: yet, as for our transgressions, of thine own free mercy, and for the sake of a righteousness of thine own providing, we shall not come into condemnation for them. Observe what it is to come into communion with God in order to blessedness. It is to converse with him as one we love and value; it is to apply ourselves closely to religion as to the business of our dwelling-place. Observe how we come into communion with God; only by God's free choice. There is abundance of goodness in God's house, and what is satisfying to the soul; there is enough for all, enough for each: it is always ready; and all without money and without price. By faith and prayer we may keep up communion with God, and bring in comfort from him, wherever we are. But it is only through that blessed One, who approaches the Father as our Advocate and Surety, that sinners may expect or can find this happiness.</body></html>
