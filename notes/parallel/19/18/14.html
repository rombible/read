They are abruptly recalled to our remembrance in the suffix ("them") of the verbs in this verse. So the LXX. and Vulg. Many ancient interpreters, however, understood by <span class= "ital">them </span>"the lightnings," while Ewald would carry the pronoun on to the "waters" in the next verse. Instead of "shot" (<span class= "ital">rab</span>) many render as if it were the adjective "many," "his numerous lightnings." But comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-6.htm" title="Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out your arrows, and destroy them.">Psalm 144:6</a> and the verse in Samuel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them</span>. God's "arrows" are often spoken cf. Job felt them within him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>). David has already said of them, that they are "ordained against the persecutors" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>). We may understand by the expression any sharp pains, mental or bodily, which God sends<span class="cmt_word">. And he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</span> The effect of the tempest of God's wrath is to "scatter" and "discomfit" the enemy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>). Instead of" and he shot out lightnings," our Revisers give, <span class="accented">and lightnings manifold</span>, which is perhaps better. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-19 The first words, I will love thee, O Lord, my strength, are the scope and contents of the psalm. Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.</body></html>
