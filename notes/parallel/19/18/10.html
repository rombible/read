This passage alone would show how naturally the idea of winged attendants on the Divine Being grew out of the phenomena of cloud and storm. No doubt many features of the developed conception were derived from contact with Assyrian art, but for the poetry of this passage we have only to think of those giant pinions into which cloud so often shapes itself, this clause being in close parallelism with "wings of the wind." The variation in Samuel, "appeared" for "did fly," is, no doubt, a transcriber's error. For the picture we may compare Oceanus' approach in <span class= "ital">Prometheus Vinctus:--</span><p>"On the back of the quick-winged bird I glode,<p>And I bridled him in<p>With the will of a God."<p>MRS. BROWNING'S <span class= "ital">translation.</span><p>It has been, however, conjectured that for <span class= "ital">kher-b </span>we should read <span class= "ital">rekh-b, </span>"chariot," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm" title="Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters: who makes the clouds his chariot: who walks on the wings of the wind:">Psalm 104:3</a>.

The imagery here transcends all experience, and scarcely admits of comment or explanation. God is represented as borne through the heavens, as he proceeds to execute his purposes, by the highest of his creatures, the cherubim. Elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>) he sails through the sky supported on clouds. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he sped swiftly</span> (Kay). The verb used is different from that translated "did fly" in the preceding verse. It is applied elsewhere especially to the eagle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-19 The first words, I will love thee, O Lord, my strength, are the scope and contents of the psalm. Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.</body></html>
