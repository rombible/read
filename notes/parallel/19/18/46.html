Terms of praise are accumulated, and the whole is made to culminate in a Messianic burst, where David is swallowed up in his "Seed;" and the "Anointed King" presented to our view is rather the antitype than the type - rather Christ Jesus than the son of Jesse. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord liveth</span>. God was known to Israel as "the living God" from the time of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>). The epithet exalted him above all other so-called gods, who were not living (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-4.htm">Isaiah 37:4, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>). But it had also a very precious, absolute meaning. God's life was the source of man's. It was through God (who had life in himself) breathing into man the breath of life that man became a living soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Hence "the living God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-2.htm">Psalm 42:2</a>) is "the God of our life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And blessed be my Rock</span> (see vers. 1, 31). In blessing "his Rock," David blesses God for his qualities of firmness, steadfastness, and trustworthiness. And let the God of my salvation be exalted. "The God of my salvation" is a favourite phrase with David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-14.htm">Psalm 51:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-1.htm">Psalm 88:1</a>). Other writers use it rarely. When David prays that the God of his salvation (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the God who continually saves him and preserves him) may be "exalted," he probably desires that he may be praised and honoured of all men. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:32, and the following verses, are the gifts of God to the spiritual warrior, whereby he is prepared for the contest, after the example of his victorious Leader. Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore. Amen.</body></html>
