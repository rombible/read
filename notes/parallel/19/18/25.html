We cannot explain this description of God's attitude to man, as if the poet were merely dealing with the conception of the Divine formed in the breast. No doubt his words are amply true in this sense. The human heart makes its God like itself, and to the pure and just He will be a pure and just God, to the cruel and unjust, cruel and unjust. But the definite mention of recompense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-24.htm" title="Therefore has the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.">Psalm 18:24</a>, and the reference to active interposition in behalf of the just in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-27.htm" title="For you will save the afflicted people; but will bring down high looks.">Psalm 18:27</a>, leave us no option but to understand by "shew thyself" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/18-25.htm" title="With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; with an upright man you will show yourself upright;">Psalm 18:25-26</a>, not an inward conception, but an external manifestation. It is, in fact, nothing more than a re-statement of the truth of which the history of Pharaoh is the most signal historic declaration, and which we maintain whenever we speak of the natural consequences of sin as retributive justice, the truth which is summed up in the text, "whatsoever a mau soweth that shall he also reap." We must at the same time remember that the form of the statement in the psalm is due to the view current in Israel before the development of the conception of Satanic agency, that all suggestions, evil as well as good, came from the mind of the Supreme Disposer of events.<p>(25) <span class= "bld">Man.</span>--The text of Samuel has "hero" (<span class= "ital">gebor </span>instead of <span class= "ital">gebar</span>)<span class= "ital">.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-28.</span> - A short didactic digression is here interposed, extending the principles on which God has dealt with David and his enemies, to mankind generally (vers. 25-27); after which a return is made to Go&'s special dealings with David (ver. 28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful</span>. The main principle is that God will act towards men as they act towards him. If they are kindly, gracious, loving towards him - for this is what the word <span class="accented">chasid</span> means - he will be kindly, gracious, loving towards them, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> explained in vers. 26, 27<span class="cmt_word">. With an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright;</span> or, <span class="accented">a perfect man</span> (Revised Version). The word is the same as that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-1.htm">Psalm 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>, etc., and generally translated "godly," or, in the plural, "saints." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:20-28 Those that forsake the ways of the Lord, depart from their God. But though conscious to ourselves of many a false step, let there not be a wicked departure from our God. David kept his eye upon the rule of God's commands. Constant care to keep from that sin, whatever it be, which most easily besets us, proves that we are upright before God. Those who show mercy to others, even they need mercy. Those who are faithful to God, shall find him all that to them which he has promised to be. The words of the Lord are pure words, very sure to be depended on, and very sweet to be delighted in. Those who resist God, and walk contrary to him, shall find that he will walk contrary to them, Le 26:21-24. The gracious recompence of which David spoke, may generally be expected by those who act from right motives. Hence he speaks comfort to the humble, and terror to the proud; Thou wilt bring down high looks. And he speaks encouragement to himself; Thou wilt light my candle: thou wilt revive and comfort my sorrowful spirit; thou wilt guide my way, that I may avoid the snares laid for me. Thou wilt light my candle to work by, and give me an opportunity of serving thee. Let those that walk in darkness, and labour under discouragements, take courage; God himself will be a Light to them.</body></html>
