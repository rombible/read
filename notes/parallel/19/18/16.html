Render at once more literally and forcibly, "He laid hold of me and drew me out of great waters." The conception undoubtedly is that the "gates of death" are under these floods, and those being now parted, the sufferer can be reached and rescued.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/18-17.htm" title="He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.">Psalm 18:17-19</a> show trifling variations between the two copies of the psalm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</span> While destruction thus came upon David's enemies (vers. 12-14), God's protecting hand was stretched out to save David himself, who was carefully "taken" and tenderly "drawn" forth from among the "many waters," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dangers and difficulties which threatened him. Some commentators see in the words used - "he <span class="accented">sent</span>, he <span class="accented">took</span> me, he <span class="accented">drew</span> me" - a tacit reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-5.htm">Exodus 2:5, 10</a>, and, by implication, a sort of parallel between the deliverance of David from his foes and that of Moses from the waters of the Nile (Kay, Hengstenberg, 'Speaker's Commentary'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-19 The first words, I will love thee, O Lord, my strength, are the scope and contents of the psalm. Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.</body></html>
