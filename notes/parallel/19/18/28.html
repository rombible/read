This obvious metaphor is common in Hebrew, as in all literature. Light is an emblem of prosperity, happiness, or life itself. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-6.htm" title="The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.">Job 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm" title="How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft comes their destruction on them!

It happens to be used very frequently of David and his family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm" title="And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.">1Kings 11:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-4.htm" title="Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:">1Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-19.htm" title="Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.">2Kings 8:19</a>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm" title="There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.">Psalm 132:17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-45.</span> - As in the former narrative section (vers. 4-24) David seems to have had his earlier troubles in mind, so, in the present one, his troubles since he entered upon the kingdom seem especially to engage his thoughts. These consisted chiefly of wars with foreign enemies, in which, while he incurred many dangers, he was, upon the whole, eminently successful. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou wilt light</span> <span class="cmt_word">my candle;</span> rather, my <span class="accented">lamp</span> - <span class="accented">the</span> word generally used of the lamps supported by the seven-branched candelabrum of the tabernacle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-22.htm">Exodus 37:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-25.htm">Exodus 40:25</a>). David himself is called "the lamp of Israel" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a><span class="cmt_word">. The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness</span>. The true lamp of David, which "enlightened his darkness," was "the light of God's countenance." While this shone upon him, his whole path was bright, and he himself, reflecting the Divine rays, was a lamp to others. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:20-28 Those that forsake the ways of the Lord, depart from their God. But though conscious to ourselves of many a false step, let there not be a wicked departure from our God. David kept his eye upon the rule of God's commands. Constant care to keep from that sin, whatever it be, which most easily besets us, proves that we are upright before God. Those who show mercy to others, even they need mercy. Those who are faithful to God, shall find him all that to them which he has promised to be. The words of the Lord are pure words, very sure to be depended on, and very sweet to be delighted in. Those who resist God, and walk contrary to him, shall find that he will walk contrary to them, Le 26:21-24. The gracious recompence of which David spoke, may generally be expected by those who act from right motives. Hence he speaks comfort to the humble, and terror to the proud; Thou wilt bring down high looks. And he speaks encouragement to himself; Thou wilt light my candle: thou wilt revive and comfort my sorrowful spirit; thou wilt guide my way, that I may avoid the snares laid for me. Thou wilt light my candle to work by, and give me an opportunity of serving thee. Let those that walk in darkness, and labour under discouragements, take courage; God himself will be a Light to them.</body></html>
