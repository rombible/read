Plainly the metaphor might apply-either to the character itself, "twisted round," "awry," "perverse," or to the line of conduct pursued, "bent," "crooked," or "wrong," the opposite of "straight," or "right." "Froward" <span class= "ital">=from ward </span>(opposite to "toward"), seems to have more of the latter idea, but may combine both--<span class= "ital">a disposition turned away from good. </span>The poet therefore says, "God will turn away from those who turn away from him," a thought which even with the Christian revelation we must admit true, for still it is true that--<p>"He that shuts love out, in turn shall be<p>Shut out from love."--TENNYSON.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt</span> <span class="cmt_word">show thyself froward;</span> rather, <span class="accented">thou wilt show thyself adverse.</span> The same root is not here used for the verb as for the adjective, as is done in the three preceding clauses. The reason is well explained in the 'Speaker's Commentary:' "In dealing with the good, God shows his approval by manifesting attributes similar or identical in essence; in dealing with the wicked, he exhibits attributes which are correlative - in just proportion to their acts," but not identical. God cannot "show himself froward" - he can only show himself opposed, antagonistic, an adversary. What the psalmist means to say is that, if men oppose and thwart God, he in return will oppose and thwart them. But they will act in a perverse spirit, he in a spirit of justice and righteousness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:20-28 Those that forsake the ways of the Lord, depart from their God. But though conscious to ourselves of many a false step, let there not be a wicked departure from our God. David kept his eye upon the rule of God's commands. Constant care to keep from that sin, whatever it be, which most easily besets us, proves that we are upright before God. Those who show mercy to others, even they need mercy. Those who are faithful to God, shall find him all that to them which he has promised to be. The words of the Lord are pure words, very sure to be depended on, and very sweet to be delighted in. Those who resist God, and walk contrary to him, shall find that he will walk contrary to them, Le 26:21-24. The gracious recompence of which David spoke, may generally be expected by those who act from right motives. Hence he speaks comfort to the humble, and terror to the proud; Thou wilt bring down high looks. And he speaks encouragement to himself; Thou wilt light my candle: thou wilt revive and comfort my sorrowful spirit; thou wilt guide my way, that I may avoid the snares laid for me. Thou wilt light my candle to work by, and give me an opportunity of serving thee. Let those that walk in darkness, and labour under discouragements, take courage; God himself will be a Light to them.</body></html>
