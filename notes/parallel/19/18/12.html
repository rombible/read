Literally, <span class= "ital">From the brightness before him his clouds passed through </span>(Heb., <span class= "ital">avar</span>--LXX., <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>; Vulg., <span class= "ital">transierunt</span>)<span class= "ital"> hail and fiery coals. </span>In Samuel it is "From the brightness before him flamed fiery coals," which is the description we should expect, and, doubtless, gives the sense we are to attach to our text. Through the dark curtain of clouds the lightnings dart like emanations from the Divine brightness which they hide. The difficulty arises from the position of <span class= "ital">avaiv, </span>"his clouds," which looks like a subject rather than an object to <span class= "ital">avr-. </span>It has been conjectured, from comparison with Samuel, that the word has been inserted through error, from its likeness to the verb. If retained it must be rendered as object, "Out of the brightness of his presence there passed through his clouds hail and fiery coals." And some obscurity of language is pardonable in a description of phenomena so overpowering and bewildering as "a tempest dropping fire." A modern poet touches this feeling:--<p>"Then fire was sky, and sky fire,<p>And both one brief ecstasy,<p>Then ashes."--R. BROWNING, <span class= "ital">Easter Day.</span><p>In the Authorised Version the thought is of a sudden clearing of the heavens, which is not true to nature, and the clause "hailstones and coals of fire" comes in as an exclamation, as in the next verse. But there it is probably an erroneous repetition, being wanting in Sam. and in the LXX. version of the psalm. Notice how the feeling of the terrible fury of the storm is heightened by the mention of "hail," so rare in Palestine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the brightness that was before him his thick</span> <span class="cmt_word">clouds passed.</span> The "brightness" intended is probably that of lightning. The "thick clouds" are riven and parted asunder for the lightning to burst forth. Then come, almost simultaneously, hail stones and coals of fire; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, hail like that which fell in Egypt before the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-34</a>), when "there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail" (ver. 24) - a fire which "ran along upon the ground," or some very unusual electrical phenomenon (see the comment on Exodus in the ' Homiletic Commentary,' p. 208). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-19 The first words, I will love thee, O Lord, my strength, are the scope and contents of the psalm. Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.</body></html>
