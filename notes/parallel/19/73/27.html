The psalmist is vague with respect to the ultimate fate of the wicked, confident only of the continued existence, in a condition which he declares to be "good," of the righteous. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast destroyed all them that go a-whoring from thee.</span> The strong phrase here used is rare in the Psalms, occurring only in this place and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-39.htm">Psalm 106:39</a>. It commonly refers to idolatrous practices, but is used sometimes of other kinds of declension and alienation from God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/73.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>73:21-28 God would not suffer his people to be tempted, if his grace were not sufficient, not only to save them from harm, but to make them gainers by it. This temptation, the working of envy and discontent, is very painful. In reflecting upon it, the psalmist owns it was his folly and ignorance thus to vex himself. If good men, at any time, through the surprise and strength of temptation, think, or speak, or act amiss, they will reflect upon it with sorrow and shame. We must ascribe our safety in temptation, and our victory, not to our own wisdom, but to the gracious presence of God with us, and Christ's intercession for us. All who commit themselves to God, shall be guided with the counsel both of his word and of his Spirit, the best counsellors here, and shall be received to his glory in another world; the believing hopes and prospects of which will reconcile us to all dark providences. And the psalmist was hereby quickened to cleave the closer to God. Heaven itself could not make us happy without the presence and love of our God. The world and all its glory vanishes. The body will fail by sickness, age, and death; when the flesh fails, the conduct, courage, and comfort fail. But Christ Jesus, our Lord, offers to be all in all to every poor sinner, who renounces all other portions and confidences. By sin we are all far from God. And a profession Christ, if we go on in sin, will increase our condemnation. May we draw near, and keep near, to our God, by faith and prayer, and find it good to do so. Those that with an upright heart put their trust in God, shall never want matter for thanksgiving to him. Blessed Lord, who hast so graciously promised to become our portion in the next world, prevent us from choosing any other in this.</body></html>
