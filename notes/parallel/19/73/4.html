The ancient versions give us no help. Some emendation of the text is absolutely necessary. In the only other place it occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm" title="Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?">Isaiah 58:6</a>) the word means specially the <span class= "ital">bands of a yoke; </span>hence a most ingenious conjecture, which, by only a change of one letter, gives <span class= "ital">there are no bands to their yoke, i.e., </span>they are "chartered libertines," men of <span class= "ital">libido effrenata et indomita, </span>a description admirably in keeping with that of the animal grossness in the next clause, <span class= "ital">"fat </span>is their belly." (Comp. the image of an animal restive from over-feeding, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; Burgess, <span class= "ital">Notes on the Hebrew Psalms.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Strength.</span>--The word is curious, but explained by Arabic cognates to mean <span class= "ital">belly, </span>possibly from its <span class= "ital">roundness </span>("a fair round belly with good capon lined"); from root meaning <span class= "ital">roll.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/73.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there are no bands in their death;</span> or, <span class="accented">no sufferings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Aquila; "torments," Cheyne); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>, "They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave;" and ver. 23, "One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet." Such deaths often happen, and are a severe trial of faith to those who have no firm conviction of the reality of a hereafter. <span class="cmt_word">But their strength is firm;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their body is plump</span> (Cheyne). But the Authorized Version probably gives the true meaning. They drop into the grave while their strength is still undiminished. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/73.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>73:1-14 The psalmist was strongly tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked; a common temptation, which has tried the graces of many saints. But he lays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is the goodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughts of God will fortify against Satan's temptations. The faith even of strong believers may be sorely shaken, and ready to fail. There are storms that will try the firmest anchors. Foolish and wicked people have sometimes a great share of outward prosperity. They seem to have the least share of the troubles of this life; and they seem to have the greatest share of its comforts. They live without the fear of God, yet they prosper, and get on in the world. Wicked men often spend their lives without much sickness, and end them without great pain; while many godly persons scarcely know what health is, and die with great sufferings. Often the wicked are not frightened, either by the remembrance of their sins, or the prospect of their misery, but they die without terror. We cannot judge men's state beyond death, by what passes at their death. He looked abroad, and saw many of God's people greatly at a loss. Because the wicked are so very daring, therefore his people return hither; they know not what to say to it, and the rather, because they drink deep of the bitter cup of affliction. He spoke feelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no disputing against sense, except by faith. From all this arose a strong temptation to cast off religion. But let us learn that the true course of sanctification consists in cleansing a man from all pollution both of soul and body. The heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ laid hold upon by faith; and by the begun works of the Lord's Spirit, manifested in the hearty resolution, purpose, and study of holiness, and a blameless course of life and actions, the hands are cleansed. It is not in vain to serve God and keep his ordinances.</body></html>
