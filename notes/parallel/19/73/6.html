The violence of the great ones in Israel is continually denounced, both by psalmists and prophets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-9.htm">Psalm 55:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-14.htm">Psalm 72:14</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/73.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>73:1-14 The psalmist was strongly tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked; a common temptation, which has tried the graces of many saints. But he lays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is the goodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughts of God will fortify against Satan's temptations. The faith even of strong believers may be sorely shaken, and ready to fail. There are storms that will try the firmest anchors. Foolish and wicked people have sometimes a great share of outward prosperity. They seem to have the least share of the troubles of this life; and they seem to have the greatest share of its comforts. They live without the fear of God, yet they prosper, and get on in the world. Wicked men often spend their lives without much sickness, and end them without great pain; while many godly persons scarcely know what health is, and die with great sufferings. Often the wicked are not frightened, either by the remembrance of their sins, or the prospect of their misery, but they die without terror. We cannot judge men's state beyond death, by what passes at their death. He looked abroad, and saw many of God's people greatly at a loss. Because the wicked are so very daring, therefore his people return hither; they know not what to say to it, and the rather, because they drink deep of the bitter cup of affliction. He spoke feelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no disputing against sense, except by faith. From all this arose a strong temptation to cast off religion. But let us learn that the true course of sanctification consists in cleansing a man from all pollution both of soul and body. The heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ laid hold upon by faith; and by the begun works of the Lord's Spirit, manifested in the hearty resolution, purpose, and study of holiness, and a blameless course of life and actions, the hands are cleansed. It is not in vain to serve God and keep his ordinances.</body></html>
