He began to think not of the present, but the future; not of the advantages of sin, but its consequences--but still consequences in <span class= "ital">this </span>world, the thought of a hereafter not having established itself sufficiently to have an ethical force.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/73.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until I went into the sanctuary of God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the sanctuaries</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-1.htm">Psalm 84:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>). The three subdivisions of beth the tabernacle and the first temple, viz. the court, the holy place, and the holy of holies, constituted three sanctuaries. The psalmist, in his perplexity, took his doubts into the sanctuary of God, and there, "in the calmness of the sacred court" (Kay), reconsidered the hard problem. Compare Hezekiah's action with the perplexing letter of Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14</a>). Then <span class="cmt_word">understood I their end.</span> There came to him in the sanctuary the thought that, to judge aright of the happiness or misery of any man, it is necessary to await the end (comp. Herod., 1:32; Soph., 'OEd. Tyr.,' ad fin.; Eurip., 'Andromach.,' 50:100; Aristot., ' Eth. Nic.,' 1:10). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/73.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>73:15-20 The psalmist having shown the progress of his temptation, shows how faith and grace prevailed. He kept up respect for God's people, and with that he restrained himself from speaking what he had thought amiss. It is a sign that we repent of the evil thoughts of the heart, if we suppress them. Nothing gives more offence to God's children, than to say it is vain to serve God; for there is nothing more contrary to their universal experience. He prayed to God to make this matter plain to him; and he understood the wretched end of wicked people; even in the height of their prosperity they were but ripening for ruin. The sanctuary must be the resort of a tempted soul. The righteous man's afflictions end in peace, therefore he is happy; the wicked man's enjoyments end in destruction, therefore he is miserable. The prosperity of the wicked is short and uncertain, slippery places. See what their prosperity is; it is but a vain show, it is only a corrupt imagination, not substance, but a mere shadow; it is as a dream, which may please us a little while we are slumbering, yet even then it disturbs our repose.</body></html>
