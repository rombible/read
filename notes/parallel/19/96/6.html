So the version of Apollinaris, "Pureness and stately glory fit his shrine." The chronicler having adopted this psalm as suitable for the occasion when the ark was brought to Zion by David, has substituted "strength and gladness are in his <span class= "ital">place" </span>possibly because the Temple was not built at that time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/96.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Honour and majesty are before him</span>. Another paronomasia - <span class="accented">hod ve-hadar</span>. Dr. Kay translates, "grandeur and majesty;" Professor Cheyne, "glory and grandeur." <span class="cmt_word">Strength</span> <span class="cmt_word">and beauty are in his sanctuary.</span> The original phrase used seems to have been, "Strength and <span class="accented">gladness</span> are in his <span class="accented">place"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-27.htm">1 Chronicles 16:27</a>) - terms suiting the simplicity of David's time. When the psalms came to be used in the temple service, loftier language was more fitting. The whole passage has probable reference to the glory of God as seated between the cherubim in the first temple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/96.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>96:1-9 When Christ finished his work on earth, and was received into his glory in heaven, the church began to sing a new song unto him, and to bless his name. His apostles and evangelists showed forth his salvation among the heathen, his wonders among all people. All the earth is here summoned to worship the Lord. We must worship him in the beauty of holiness, as God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. Glorious things are said of him, both as motives to praise and matter of praise.</body></html>
