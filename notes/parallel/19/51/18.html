They do not fit in well with the theory of Davidic authorship, Theodoret long ago saying that they better suited the exiles in Babylon. They seem at first sight to contradict what has just been asserted of sacrifice. On both grounds they have been regarded as a liturgical addition, such as doubtless the compiler made, without any sense of infringement of the rights of authorship. On the other hand, it is not only these two verses which harmonise with the feelings of the restored exiles, but the whole psalm, and the contradiction in regard to the worth of sacrifices is only apparent. While vindicating spiritual religion, the psalmist no more abrogates ceremonies than the prophets do. As soon as their performance is possible they will be resumed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - That this is an addition made to the original psalm, during the time of the Babylonian exile, or later, for liturgical purposes, has been maintained by a large number of the commentators who ascribe the rest of the psalm to David. The chief ground for the supposition is the prayer in ver. 18, "Build thou the walls of Jerusalem," which has been supposed to imply that the walls were in ruins, whereas under David they should have been, it is thought, in good condition. But it has been pointed out, very justly, that the fortifications of Jerusalem were not complete in David's time, and that both he and Solomon added considerably to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15, 19</a>). David may well have thought that, as a punishment for his sin, God might interfere with the work which he was doing for the benefit of his people, and hence have felt it needful to pray, "Do good unto Zion: build thou the wails of Jerusalem." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion</span>. It is characteristic of David to pass from prayer for himself to prayer for the people committed to him, and especially to do so at or near the end of a psalm (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-11.htm">Psalm 5:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-22.htm">Psalm 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-16.htm">Psalm 40:16</a>). And he closely connects - nay, identifies - the people with their capital city (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-11.htm">Psalm 48:11</a>: 69:35, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</span> Josephus says that David encompassed the whole city of Jerusalem with walls ('Ant. Jud.,' 7:3, &sect; 2); and we are told, in the Second Book of Samuel, that he "built round about from Mille and inward." It has been argued that his walls were just approaching their completion at the time of his great sin (<span class="accented">Christian Observer</span>, No. 333). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:16-19 Those who are thoroughly convinced of their misery and danger by sin, would spare no cost to obtain the remission of it. But as they cannot make satisfaction for sin, so God cannot take any satisfaction in them, otherwise than as expressing love and duty to him. The good work wrought in every true penitent, is a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, and sorrow for sin. It is a heart that is tender, and pliable to God's word. Oh that there were such a heart in every one of us! God is graciously pleased to accept this; it is instead of all burnt-offering and sacrifice. The broken heart is acceptable to God only through Jesus Christ; there is no true repentance without faith in him. Men despise that which is broken, but God will not. He will not overlook it, he will not refuse or reject it; though it makes God no satisfaction for the wrong done to him by sin. Those who have been in spiritual troubles, know how to pity and pray for others afflicted in like manner. David was afraid lest his sin should bring judgements upon the city and kingdom. No personal fears or troubles of conscience can make the soul, which has received grace, careless about the interests of the church of God. And let this be the continued joy of all the redeemed, that they have redemption through the blood of Christ, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace.</body></html>
