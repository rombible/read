The honour of God, as God of the covenant, was at stake. It is this thought which appears in the last clauses of this verse.<p><span class= "bld">That . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">So that </span>(or, <span class= "ital">in order that</span>)<span class= "ital"> thou art </span>(or <span class= "ital">mayest be</span>)<span class= "ital"> justified in thy cause, and clear in thy judgment. </span>The Hebrew, rendered in the Authorised Version <span class= "ital">when thou speakest, </span>is often used of a cause or suit (see (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/18-16.htm" title="When they have a matter, they come to me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.">Exodus 18:16-22</a>, "matter," &c), and it is here plainly used in this sense and is parallel to judgment. The clause seems to imply not only a sense of <span class= "bld">a </span>breach of the covenant, but some manifest judgment from Jehovah in consequence; and, as usual, it is of its effect on the heathen that the psalmist thinks. The Divine honour would be justified when the suffering nation confessed that condemnation and punishment had been deserved. This was apparently the meaning read in the words by the LXX.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against thee, thee only, have I sinned</span>. Though no sins could be more directly against man than adultery and murder, yet David feels that that aspect of them shrinks away into insignificance, and is as if it were not, when they are viewed in their true and real character, as offences against the majesty of God. Every sin is mainly against God; and the better sort of men always feel this. "How can I do this great wickedness," says Joseph, when tempted by Potiphar's wife, "<span class="accented">and sin against God</span>?" And so David to Nathan, when he was first rebuked by him, "I have sinned <span class="accented">against the Lord"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And done this evil in thy sight; that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.</span> Clear in the eyes of the world, that is; free from all charge of harshness or injustice, when thou judgest me, and condemnest me for my sins, as thou must do. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/51.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>51:1-6 David, being convinced of his sin, poured out his soul to God in prayer for mercy and grace. Whither should backsliding children return, but to the Lord their God, who alone can heal them? he drew up, by Divine teaching, an account of the workings of his heart toward God. Those that truly repent of their sins, will not be ashamed to own their repentance. Also, he instructs others what to do, and what to say. David had not only done much, but suffered much in the cause of God; yet he flees to God's infinite mercy, and depends upon that alone for pardon and peace. He begs the pardon of sin. The blood of Christ, sprinkled upon the conscience, blots out the transgression, and, having reconciled us to God, reconciles us to ourselves. The believer longs to have the whole debt of his sins blotted out, and every stain cleansed; he would be thoroughly washed from all his sins; but the hypocrite always has some secret reserve, and would have some favorite lust spared. David had such a deep sense of his sin, that he was continually thinking of it, with sorrow and shame. His sin was committed against God, whose truth we deny by wilful sin; with him we deal deceitfully. And the truly penitent will ever trace back the streams of actual sin to the fountain of original depravity. He confesses his original corruption. This is that foolishness which is bound in the heart of a child, that proneness to evil, and that backwardness to good, which is the burden of the regenerate, and the ruin of the unregenerate. He is encouraged, in his repentance, to hope that God would graciously accept him. Thou desirest truth in the inward part; to this God looks, in a returning sinner. Where there is truth, God will give wisdom. Those who sincerely endeavour to do their duty shall be taught their duty; but they will expect good only from Divine grace overcoming their corrupt nature.</body></html>
