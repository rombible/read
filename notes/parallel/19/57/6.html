They only bring the enemy himself into trouble (ver. 6), and cause the psalmist to pour forth a song of joy (vers. 7-11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have prepared a net for my steps</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-15.htm">Psalm 25:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-7.htm">Psalm 35:7</a>). These metaphors from the chase are peculiarly appropriate at the time when Saul was "hunting David upon the mountains" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-20.htm">1 Samuel 26:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My soul is bowed down;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they have bowed down my soul</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he has bowed down</span>; but the alternate use of the singular and the plural, without any real change of subject, is very common. <span class="cmt_word">They have digged a pit before me </span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-85.htm">Psalm 119:85</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves.</span> Here is the first note of triumph - a very familiar note (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-8.htm">Psalm 39:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a>), but one always sounded with marked satisfaction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/57.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>57:1-6 All David's dependence is upon God. The most eminent believers need often repeat the publican's prayer, God be merciful to me a sinner. But if our souls trust in the Lord, this may assure us, in our utmost dangers, that our calamities will at length be overpast, and in the mean time, by faith and prayer, we must make him our refuge. Though God be most high, yet he condescends so low, as to take care that all things are made to work for good to his people. This is a good reason why we should pray earnestly. Look which way we will on this earth, refuge fails, no help appears; but we may look for it from heaven. If we have fled from the wrath to come, unto Jesus Christ, he that performed all things needful to purchase the salvation of his people, will do for us and in us all things needful for our enjoyment of it. It made David droop to think there should be those that bore him so much ill-will. But the mischief they designed against him, returned on themselves. And when David was in the greatest distress and disgrace, he did not pray, Lord, exalt me, but, Lord, exalt thine own name. Our best encouragement in prayer, is taken from the glory of God, and to that, more than to our own comfort, we should have regard in all our petitions for mercy.</body></html>
