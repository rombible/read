Another head of suffering, viz. misrepresentation, calumny, abuse, on the part of enemies. Absalom had stolen away the hearts of the children of Israel from David by misrepresenting him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-3.htm">2 Samuel 15:3, 4</a>). Shimei had followed the example, adding to his misrepresentation abuse and cursing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-8</a>). Absalom's aiders and abettors generally, no doubt, joined in the chorus. This, then, is David's second subject of complaint, and one that he felt keenly - his enemies spoke evil of him. Farther, they desired and anticipated his death. <span class="cmt_word">When</span> (they said) <span class="cmt_word">shall he die, and his name perish?</span> David evidently was, or had been, when his enemies thus spoke, on the bed of sickness, prostrate, and in danger of his life. While he thus suffered, they rejoiced, expecting his early demise. When he was dead, they intended that his name should "perish;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that his memory should be utterly rooted out. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:5-13 We complain, and justly, of the want of sincerity, and that there is scarcely any true friendship to be found among men; but the former days were no better. One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.</body></html>
