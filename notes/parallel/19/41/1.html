David had concluded the preceding psalm by calling himself "poor and needy." He commences the present one by pronouncing a blessing on all those who "consider," or tenderly regard, and, so far as they can, assist the peer and afflicted. It is not so much actual poverty, as humiliation and weakness, of which he is speaking. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the day of evil.</span> As he has pity on his fellow-men, so God will have pity upon him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-33.htm">Matthew 18:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:1-4 The people of God are not free from poverty, sickness, or outward affliction, but the Lord will consider their case, and send due supplies. From his Lord's example the believer learns to consider his poor and afflicted brethren. This branch of godliness is usually recompensed with temporal blessings. But nothing is so distressing to the contrite believer, as a fear or sense of the Divine displeasure, or of sin in his heart. Sin is the sickness of the soul; pardoning mercy heals it, renewing grace heals it, and for this spiritual healing we should be more earnest than for bodily health.</body></html>
