The expression may mean, as in LXX. and Vulg., "a lawless speech," so the Chaldee, "a perverse word." Syriac, "a word of iniquity," or "a physical evil," as in Authorised Version, or "a moral evil." The verse is difficult, not only from this ambiguity, but also from that of the verb, which, according to the derivation we take, may mean "cleave" or "pour forth." Modern scholars prefer the latter, understanding the image as taken from the process of casting metal. <span class= "ital">An incurable wound is poured out </span>(<span class= "ital">welded</span>)<span class= "ital"> upon him. </span>(Comp. "molten," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-24.htm" title="And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.">1Kings 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-30.htm" title="And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.">1Kings 7:30</a>.) This does not, however, suit the context nearly so well as the reading,<p>"A wicked saying have they directed against me:<p>Let the sick man never rise again,"<p>which has the support of the LXX. and Vulg., though they make of the last clause a question, "Shall not the sleeper rise again?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An evil disease</span> (literally, <span class="accented">a thing of Belial</span>), say they, <span class="cmt_word">cleaveth</span> <span class="cmt_word">fast unto him</span>. (On the meaning of "Belial," see the comment on Psalm 18:4.) The "thing of Belial" here intended may, perhaps, be the disease from which David was suffering, but is more probably some disgraceful charge or infamous calumny which had been circulated concerning him, and was now crushing him down. This calumny is represented as poured out upon him like a coating of molten metal (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-23.htm">Job 41:23, 24</a>), and so cleaving to him. <span class="cmt_word">And now</span> <span class="cmt_word">that he lieth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "now that he is prostrate upon a sick-bed." <span class="cmt_word">He shall rise up no more</span>.

One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.</body></html>
