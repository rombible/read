He is called "the man of my peace," since he was one of David's official counsellors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>), and consequently on the most friendly terms with him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which did eat of my bread</span>. At Oriental courts, the king's counsellors, together with many other members of the court, habitually" eat at the king's table" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-23.htm">1 Kings 4:23, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-17.htm">Nehemiah 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Hath lifted up his heel against me</span>. (For Ahithophel's defection from David, and share in Absalom's conspiracy, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-15.htm">2 Samuel 16:15-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1-23</a>.) His conduct is here compared to that of a vicious horse, which kicks his own master. (For the relation of type and antitype between Ahithophel and Judas, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/41.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>41:5-13 We complain, and justly, of the want of sincerity, and that there is scarcely any true friendship to be found among men; but the former days were no better. One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.</body></html>
