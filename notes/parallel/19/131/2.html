It is taken from a baby's first real sorrow when he not merely feels pain, but is allowed no access to that which was his solace hitherto. He moans, and frets, and sobs, but at last is quieted by the love which is powerful to soothe, even when it must deny. So, as George Herbert says of man, "If goodness lead him not, then weariness may toss him to God's breast." But the exact rendering is matter of difference and difficulty. The verb rendered "behave" means <span class= "ital">to make equal or like. </span>This is its meaning, even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm" title="I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night will you make an end of me.">Isaiah 38:13</a>, which is the only place referred to by Gesenius in support of his translation here "calmed." We cannot, therefore, render, as many critics, "I calmed and quieted my soul." But, as in Hebrew, it is common to express one idea by the combination of two verbs, so "I made like, and I quieted my soul," is really an idiomatic way of saying "I made as quiet as." The redundancy of the sign of comparison <span class= "ital">as </span>after verbs of likening may be illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm" title="Nevertheless man being in honor stays not: he is like the beasts that perish.">Psalm 49:12</a>, as well as by the passage in Isaiah referred to above. We thus get: "Surely I made my soul as quiet as a weaned child upon his mother, as a weaned child upon me, my soul." Instead of fretting after what is too great for him, he quiets his ambition, and his spirit lies calm and gentle, like a child in its mother's arms, that after the first trouble of weaning is over is soothed and lulled by the maternal caress. Perhaps the opposite idea, expressed by the common phrase, "to <span class= "ital">nurse </span>ambitious thoughts," may serve to illustrate this somewhat unwonted image. For Israel as a "weaned child," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm" title="Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.">Isaiah 28:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/131.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely I have behaved and quieted myself</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">have stilled and quieted my soul</span>. I have brought my soul into a state of peacefulness and content. <span class="cmt_word">As a child that is weaned of his mother</span>. The weaned child is quiet and content; the suckling always impatient and restless. <span class="cmt_word">My soul is even as a weaned child</span>. Another repetition for the sake of emphasis (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5, 6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/131.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>131:1-3 The psalmist's humility. Believers encouraged to trust in God. - The psalmist aimed at nothing high or great, but to be content in every condition God allotted. Humble saints cannot think so well of themselves as others think of them. The love of God reigning in the heart, will subdue self-love. Where there is a proud heart, there is commonly a proud look. To know God and our duty, is learning sufficiently high for us. It is our wisdom not to meddle with that which does not belong to us. He was well reconciled to every condition the Lord placed him in. He had been as humble as a little child about the age of weaning, and as far from aiming at high things; as entirely at God's disposal, as the child at the disposal of the mother or nurse. We must become as little children, Mt 18:3. Our hearts are desirous of worldly things, cry for them, and are fond of them; but, by the grace of God, a soul that is made holy, is weaned from these things. The child is cross and fretful while in the weaning; but in a day or two it cares no longer for milk, and it can bear stronger food. Thus does a converted soul quiet itself under the loss of what it loved, and disappointments in what it hoped for, and is easy whatever happens. When our condition is not to our mind, we must bring our mind to our condition; then we are easy to ourselves and all about us; then our souls are as a weaned child. And thus the psalmist recommends confidence in God, to all the Israel of God, from his own experience. It is good to hope, and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord under every trial.</body></html>
