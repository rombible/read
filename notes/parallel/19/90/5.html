The verb, <span class= "ital">carries away with its floods </span>is found only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-17.htm" title="The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: your arrows also went abroad.">Psalm 77:17</a> ("the clouds poured out water"), but the cognate noun is frequent for a heavy rainfall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-6.htm" title="And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.">Isaiah 4:6</a>, &c.), such as in the East in a few moments causes a flood. This interpretation is partly supported by the LXX. and Vulg.: "Their years shall be nothingness;" and many commentators have felt that the image of the "stream of time" was required here. For the rendering <span class= "ital">cut down, </span>comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-24.htm" title="They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.">Job 24:24</a>. Some prefer "fades." The general force of the figure is the same whether we think of the generations dropping away like withered grass or cut down and dried like hay.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/90.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou carriest them away as with a flood.</span> This verse is to be connected with ver. 3, "Thou sweepest mankind away;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> removest them from the earth, when it pleases thee. <span class="cmt_word">They are as a sleep.</span> Fantastic, vague, forgotten as soon as it is over. <span class="cmt_word">In the morning they are like grass which groweth up</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/90.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>90:1-6 It is supposed that this psalm refers to the sentence passed on Israel in the wilderness, Nu 14. The favour and protection of God are the only sure rest and comfort of the soul in this evil world. Christ Jesus is the refuge and dwelling-place to which we may repair. We are dying creatures, all our comforts in the world are dying comforts, but God is an ever-living God, and believers find him so. When God, by sickness, or other afflictions, turns men to destruction, he thereby calls men to return unto him to repent of their sins, and live a new life. A thousand years are nothing to God's eternity: between a minute and a million of years there is some proportion; between time and eternity there is none. All the events of a thousand years, whether past or to come, are more present to the Eternal Mind, than what was done in the last hour is to us. And in the resurrection, the body and soul shall both return and be united again. Time passes unobserved by us, as with men asleep; and when it is past, it is as nothing. It is a short and quickly-passing life, as the waters of a flood. Man does but flourish as the grass, which, when the winter of old age comes, will wither; but he may be mown down by disease or disaster.</body></html>
