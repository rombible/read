The root to which the word is usually assigned means "to be weary," from which the idea of strength can only be derived on the <span class= "ital">lucus a non lucendo </span>principle. Keeping the usual derivation, we may, with many critics, give the word the sense of "mines" or "treasures," because of the labours of extracting metal from the earth. This suits <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-25.htm" title="Yes, the Almighty shall be your defense, and you shall have plenty of silver.">Job 22:25</a>, and makes a good parallelism. But the LXX. and Vulg. have "heights," and by another derivation the Hebrew may mean shining, and so "sunny summit." With this agrees the rendering of the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-22.htm" title="God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn.">Numbers 23:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm" title="God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.">Numbers 24:8</a>, and the rhythm is preserved by an antithetic parallelism, as in next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/95.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In his hand are</span> <span class="cmt_word">the deep places of the earth; the strength of the hills is his also</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the summits of the mountains are his also.</span> The meaning is that <span class="accented">all</span> the earth is his, from the highest heights to the lowest depths. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/95.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>95:1-7 Whenever we come into God's presence, we must come with thanksgiving. The Lord is to be praised; we do not want matter, it were well if we did not want a heart. How great is that God, whose the whole earth is, and the fulness thereof; who directs and disposes of all!, The Lord Jesus, whom we are here taught to praise, is a great God; the mighty God is one of his titles, and God over all, blessed for evermore. To him all power is given, both in heaven and earth. He is our God, and we should praise him. He is our Saviour, and the Author of our blessedness. The gospel church is his flock, Christ is the great and good Shepherd of believers; he sought them when lost, and brought them to his fold.</body></html>
