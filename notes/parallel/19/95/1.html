From this opening phrase, which finds an echo in vers. 2 and 6, this psalm has been called "The Invitatory Psalm." As it invited the Jews, so it now invites Christian congregations, to join in the worship of the sanctuary. <span class="cmt_word">Let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-4.htm">Psalm 98:4</a>). Loudness of voice was regarded as indicating earnestness of heart (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-19.htm">2 Chronicles 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-13.htm">Ezra 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-42.htm">Nehemiah 12:42</a>, etc.).

It is well paraphrased in our Prayer book Version, "the <span class="accented">strength</span> of our salvation." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/95.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>95:1-7 Whenever we come into God's presence, we must come with thanksgiving. The Lord is to be praised; we do not want matter, it were well if we did not want a heart. How great is that God, whose the whole earth is, and the fulness thereof; who directs and disposes of all!, The Lord Jesus, whom we are here taught to praise, is a great God; the mighty God is one of his titles, and God over all, blessed for evermore. To him all power is given, both in heaven and earth. He is our God, and we should praise him. He is our Saviour, and the Author of our blessedness. The gospel church is his flock, Christ is the great and good Shepherd of believers; he sought them when lost, and brought them to his fold.</body></html>
