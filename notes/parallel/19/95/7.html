The Masoretic text connects it with the preceding part of the verse, and there seems no good reason for departing from that arrangement. Indeed, the change from the third person, "his voice," to the first, "tempted me," in the same sentence is intolerable even in Hebrew poetry. Nor is there any necessity to suppose the loss of a line. Render: "For He is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, the sheep of his hand. Today would that ye would hearken to his voice." The Oriental custom of leading flocks by the voice is doubtless alluded to, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-4.htm" title="And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.">John 10:4</a>.

This is delivered in four, or rather four and a half, verses, and commences with the words, "Today if ye will hear his voice." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Today</span>. This word, standing prominently forward as it does, is a startling call, intimating that the time is come for a momentous decision. <span class="cmt_word">If ye will hear his voice.</span> God is crying to his people - will they hear, or will they forbear? If the former, all will go well; if the latter, than assuredly they shall not enter into his rest. The "voice" intended proceeds to give the warning of vers. 8-11. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/95.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>95:7-11 Christ calls upon his people to hear his voice. You call him Master, or Lord; then be his willing, obedient people. Hear the voice of his doctrine, of his law, and in both, of his Spirit: hear and heed; hear and yield. Christ's voice must be heard to-day. This day of opportunity will not last always; improve it while it is called to-day. Hearing the voice of Christ is the same with believing. Hardness of heart is at the bottom of all distrust of the Lord. The sins of others ought to be warnings to us not to tread in their steps. The murmurings of Israel were written for our admonition. God is not subject to such passions as we are; but he is very angry at sin and sinners. That certainly is evil, which deserves such a recompence; and his threatenings are as sure as his promises. Let us be aware of the evils of our hearts, which lead us to wander from the Lord. There is a rest ordained for believers, the rest of everlasting refreshment, begun in this life, and perfected in the life to come. This is the rest which God calls his rest.</body></html>
