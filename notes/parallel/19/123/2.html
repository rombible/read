The picture will be so familiar to readers of Oriental stories as hardly to need actual illustration; but Savary's (<span class= "ital">Letters on Egypt, </span>p. 135, quoted by Perowne) description exactly reproduces the intention of the poet: "The slaves stand silent at the bottom of the rooms, with their hands crossed over their breasts. <span class= "ital">With their eyes fixed upon their master, </span>they seek to anticipate every one of his wishes." Comp. "Cave oculos a meis oculis quoquam demoveas" (Ter. <span class= "ital">Adelph. </span>Ii. 1<span class= "bld">, </span>16).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/123.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters.</span> Watch, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>., for the slightest sign that he may give of his will. Such signs were usually given by some movement of the "hand." <span class="cmt_word">And as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress.</span> Masters were waited on by male slaves; their wives by handmaids - both equally anxious to do their will, and therefore equally watchful of all the signs that indicated it. So our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us. We wait for the least sign that he is about to help and deliver us. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/123.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>123:1-4 Confidence in God under contempt. - Our Lord Jesus has taught us to look unto God in prayer as our Father in heaven. In every prayer a good man lifts up his soul to God; especially when in trouble. We desire mercy from him; we hope he will show us mercy, and we will continue waiting on him till it come. The eyes of a servant are to his master's directing hand, expecting that he will appoint him his work. And also to his supplying hand. Servants look to their master or their mistress for their portion of meat in due season. And to God we must look for daily bread, for grace sufficient; from him we must receive it thankfully. Where can we look for help but to our Master? And, further, to his protecting hand. If the servant is wronged and injured in his work, who should right him, but his master? And to his correcting hand. Whither should sinners turn but to him that smote them? They humble themselves under God's mighty hand. And lastly, to his rewarding hand. Hypocrites look to the world's hand, thence they have their reward; but true Christians look to God as their Master and their Rewarder. God's people find little mercy with men; but this is their comfort, that with the Lord there is mercy. Scorning and contempt have been, are, and are likely to be, the lot of God's people in this world. It is hard to bear; but the servants of God should not complain if they are treated as his beloved Son was. Let us then, when ready to faint under trials, look unto Jesus, and by faith and prayer cast ourselves upon the mercy of God.</body></html>
