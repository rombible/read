It was one very familiar to the Assyrians and Babylonians ('Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 56, 60, 68, etc.).

The counsels of this mercy have been from everlasting, and the effects of it will endure for ever, to all who are interested in it. The Lord continues equally ready to show mercy to all who seek for it, and this is the source of all our hope and comfort.</body></html>
