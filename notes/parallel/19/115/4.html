They scoff at the God of Israel. What, then, are their own gods? Silver and gold indeed (ver. 4), but the work of human hands. Fashioned into a human shape, as if they were sentient being - but absolutely devoid of all sense and intelligence. The satire is somewhat roughly worked out (vers. 5-7), but idolatry provokes rough speaking; and the tone here adopted is imitated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-18</a>, and echoed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>. The inspired writers seem to have felt, that, when idolatry came under consideration, the criticism should be brief and trenchant. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their idols are silver and gold</span>. At the best - often mere wood and stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-28.htm">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>); but the idols of the Babylonians were mostly of the more precious materials (Herod., 1:183; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-1.htm">Daniel 3:1</a>; Ep. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4, 11</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The work of men's hands</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-12.htm">Isaiah 44:12-17</a>). To avoid this reproach, some images were said to have fallen down from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/115.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>115:1-8 Let no opinion of our own merits have any place in our prayers or in our praises. All the good we do, is done by the power of his grace; and all the good we have, is the gift of his mere mercy, and he must have all the praise. Are we in pursuit of any mercy, and wrestling with God for it, we must take encouragement in prayer from God only. Lord, do so for us; not that we may have the credit and comfort of it, but that they mercy and truth may have the glory of it. The heathen gods are senseless things. They are the works of men's hands: the painter, the carver, the statuary, can put no life into them, therefore no sense. The psalmist hence shows the folly of the worshippers of idols.</body></html>
