It is like the pointed application of some general truth in a sermon. It is possible that in the liturgic use a change in the music was made here, the Levites and choir turning to the people with a loud burst of song.<p><span class= "bld">He is their help and their shield.</span>--The original form of this motto of trust appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm" title="Our soul waits for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.">Psalm 33:20</a>. Here the change of person suggests some musical arrangement. Apparently one part of the choir, or, it may be, one officiating priest, addressed successively the whole congregation with the charge, "trust in Jehovah," and each time the full choir took up the refrain, "He is their helper and shield," repeating to the priest the ground on which he urged confidence and loyalty. Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/115-12.htm" title="The LORD has been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.">Psalm 115:12-13</a> congregation and choir join, changing to <span class= "ital">the first </span>person.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/115.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - The idols and the idol-worshippers having been sufficiently scorned; the latter especially, for their "trust" in idols, Israel is exhorted to trust in the only sure Object of confidence, Jehovah. Three several times the leader of the choir gives forth the call - " Trust in the Lord " - and three several times the choir responds with the acknowledgment that he, and he alone, "is their Help and Shield." The exhortation seems to be addressed, first, to the lay people generally (ver. 9); then to the clerical order (ver. 10); finally, to all, whether laity or clergy, who are true Israelites at heart (comp. vers. 12, 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Israel, trust thou in the Lord.</span> Follow not the example of the heathen who trust in idols. Rather, be an example to them. <span class="cmt_word">He is their Help and their Shield</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>). The change of per son implies a change of speaker. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/115.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>115:9-18 It is folly to trust in dead images, but it is wisdom to trust in the living God, for he is a help and a shield to those that trust in him. Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use. The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God: death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our souls for ever.</body></html>
