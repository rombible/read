This was the original blessing bestowed on Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-6</a>), and continually reiterated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>, etc.). It is much dwelt upon by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8-12, 18-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3-12</a>, etc.). The main fulfillment of the promise was through the conversion of the Gentiles, who, when converted, became the true "Israel of God." But, even apart from this, the lineal descendants of Abraham have "increased more and more," to an extent which is most extraordinary. <span class="cmt_word">You and your children</span>. You yourselves shall increase; but your children shall yet more increase. The multiplying would begin at once, but would be greater and more striking afterwards. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/115.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>115:9-18 It is folly to trust in dead images, but it is wisdom to trust in the living God, for he is a help and a shield to those that trust in him. Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use. The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God: death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our souls for ever.</body></html>
