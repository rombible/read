Why the psalmist should suddenly be struck with the dreadful thought that death broke the covenant relationship, and silenced prayer and praise, is not easy to see. Was the psalm first chanted after some victory? and was this suggested by the sight of the slain, who, though they had helped to win the triumph, could yet have no share in the praises that were ascending to Jehovah?<p>(17) <span class= "bld">Silence.</span>--The land of silence is, of course, Sheol, the under-world. (So the LXX., "Hades.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/115.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - Once more the choir and congregation speak. The mention of "heaven and earth" (ver. 15) reminds them of the third place - <span class="accented">Sheol</span>. In <span class="accented">Sheol</span> is no praise of God, but only "silence." They, at any rate, while they remain on earth, and have the power to praise God, will praise him without ceasing. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The dead praise not the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither any that go down into silence</span>. The notion of <span class="accented">Sheol</span> as a place of silence occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-17.htm">Psalm 94:17</a>, and strongly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a> (see the 'Pulpit Commentary on Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 39). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/115.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>115:9-18 It is folly to trust in dead images, but it is wisdom to trust in the living God, for he is a help and a shield to those that trust in him. Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use. The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God: death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our souls for ever.</body></html>
