The recurrence also of parts of the verb "to lift up" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/75-4.htm" title="I said to the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:">Psalm 75:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-7.htm" title="But God is the judge: he puts down one, and sets up another.">Psalm 75:7</a>, makes in favour of taking <span class= "ital">harim </span>as part of the same verb here, instead of as a noun, "mountains." That the word <span class= "ital">midbar </span>(wilderness) might be used for "south," receives support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-26.htm" title="And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.">Acts 8:26</a>.<p>Ewald thinks the four points of the compass should be completed by inserting a conjunction, and taking the "desert" and "mountains" to represent respectively the <span class= "ital">south </span>and <span class= "ital">north. </span>He then supplies the conclusion of the sentence from the following verse:--<p>"For neither from east nor west,<p>Neither from desert nor mountains,<p>Cometh judgment; but God is Judge."<p>This agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm" title="The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder on them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.">1Samuel 2:10</a>; but it is hardly needful to expect such scientific accuracy as to the points of the compass in Hebrew poetry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/75.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</span> So Hupfeld, Kay, Canon Cook, and the Revised Version Others suggest the meaning to be, "For it is not from the east, nor is it from the west, nor yet from the mountainous desert [that help cometh]." But the ellipse of the main idea is improbable. The address is to the enemies who threaten Israel, "Lift not up your horns - speak not proudly - for exaltation comes not from any earthly quarter - east, west, north, or south" ("north" being omitted, as sufficiently implied in the others); it is God alone who gives it, and he is not likely to give it to you." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/75.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>75:6-10. No second causes will raise men to preferment without the First Cause. It comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. He mentions not the north; the same word that signifies the north, signifies the secret place; and from the secret of God's counsel it does come. From God alone all must receive their doom. There are mixtures of mercy and grace in the cup of affliction, when it is put into the hands of God's people; mixtures of the curse, when it is put into the hands of the wicked. God's people have their share in common calamities, but the dregs of the cup are for the wicked. The exaltation of the Son of David will be the subject of the saints' everlasting praises. Then let sinners submit to the King of righteousness, and let believers rejoice in and obey him.</body></html>
