The word rendered in the Authorised Version "congregation" (<span class= "ital">moed</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>has plainly here its first derivative sense of a set time, or "occasion." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-13.htm" title="You shall arise, and have mercy on Zion: for the time to favor her, yes, the set time, is come.">Psalm 102:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm" title="For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.">Habakkuk 2:3</a>.) So LXX. and Vulg. here; but Symmachus gives "synagogue."<p>It is quite clear that the speaker of these words is God Himself, who suddenly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-10.htm" title="Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.">Psalm 46:10</a>, breaks in with the announcement of judgment. But how far the Divine utterance extends in the psalm is not quite clear. Some end it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm" title="The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it.

This, however, he will do "at his own set time," for which men must wait patiently (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will judge uprightly;</span> or, "with uprightness" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-1.htm">Psalm 58:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/75.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>75:1-5 We often pray for mercy, when in pursuit of it; and shall we only once or twice give thanks, when we obtain it? God shows that he is nigh to us in what we call upon him for. Public trusts are to be managed uprightly. This may well be applied to Christ and his government. Man's sin threatened to destroy the whole creation; but Christ saved the world from utter ruin. He who is made of God to us wisdom, bids us be wise. To the proud, daring sinners he says, Boast not of your power, persist not in contempt. All the present hopes and future happiness of the human race spring from the Son of God.</body></html>
