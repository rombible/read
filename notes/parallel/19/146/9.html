The orphan and widow are mentioned as under God's care (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm" title="A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.">Psalm 68:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Relieveth.</span>--Or rather, <span class= "ital">restoreth, </span>by taking up their cause and seeing justice done. Certain forms of the verb are used of bearing witness, and possibly here there is allusion to a court of justice, in which God appears as witnessing on the side of the weak and defenceless.<p><span class= "bld">Turneth upside down.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">bends aside. </span>The same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-78.htm" title="Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in your precepts.">Psalm 119:78</a> is rendered" dealt perversely." The idea seems in both cases to be that of interference, to thwart and impede a course of action. In Psalms 119 it is an evil-disposed person who interferes with the righteous. Here it is the Divine providence which, when the wicked man has laid out his plans, and looks as it were along a plain and level road of prosperity, bends the prosperous course aside; makes the path crooked, instead of straight; full of trouble and calamity, instead of prosperous and sure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/146.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord preserveth the strangers</span>. God's goodness leads him not only to protect the righteous, but also to lend his special help to the weak and afflicted classes. "The stranger, the fatherless, and the widow" are constantly mentioned in the Old Testament as peculiar objects of the Divine care (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-28.htm">Isaiah 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He relieveth the fatherless and widow</span>; or, "upholdeth" (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-20.htm">Psalm 145:20</a>). His merciful protection of his saints leads him to overthrow the goings of the wicked, who are their enemies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/146.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>146:5-10 The psalmist encourages us to put confidence in God. We must hope in the providence of God for all we need as to this life, and in the grace of God for that which is to come. The God of heaven became a man that he might become our salvation. Though he died on the cross for our sins, and was laid in the grave, yet his thoughts of love to us did not perish; he rose again to fulfil them. When on earth, his miracles were examples of what he is still doing every day. He grants deliverance to captives bound in the chains of sin and Satan. He opens the eyes of the understanding. He feeds with the bread of life those who hunger for salvation; and he is the constant Friend of the poor in spirit, the helpless: with him poor sinners, that are as fatherless, find mercy; and his kingdom shall continue for ever. Then let sinners flee to him, and believers rejoice in him. And as the Lord shall reign for ever, let us stir up each other to praise his holy name.</body></html>
