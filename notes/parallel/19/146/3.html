The verse, no doubt, was in Shakespeare's mind when he made Wolsey say:<p>"Oh, how wretched<p>Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!"<p>as it was quoted by Strafford when the news reached him that Charles I. had given the royal assent to the bill of attainder against him. But in the psalm it is not the caprice of princes, as in these notable instances, but their frailty as men that is declared untrustworthy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/146.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put not your trust in princes</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>). Israel was always apt to trust in bureau rather than Divine help. Now it was Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>), now Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>), now their own kings or nobles. At the time of the return from the Captivity, too much was expected from Zerubbabel and the other "princes." <span class="cmt_word">Nor in the son of man.</span> The Prayer-book paraphrase, "nor in any child of man," brings out the sense. Confidence in human aid of whatever kind is forbidden. <span class="cmt_word">In whom there is no help;</span> or, "that hath no saving power" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5d4;</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/146.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>146:1-4 If it is our delight to praise the Lord while we live, we shall certainly praise him to all eternity. With this glorious prospect before us, how low do worldly pursuits seem! There is a Son of man in whom there is help, even him who is also the Son of God, who will not fail those that trust in him. But all other sons of men are like the man from whom they sprung, who, being in honour, did not abide. God has given the earth to the children of men, but there is great striving about it. Yet, after a while, no part of the earth will be their own, except that in which their dead bodies are laid. And when man returns to his earth, in that very day all his plans and designs vanish and are gone: what then comes of expectations from him?</body></html>
