Evidently the danger to be guarded against was not so much a sinful act as a sinful utterance, and the expression "to make pretexts or excuses" may possibly refer to the casuistries by which some of the laxer Jews excused their participation in heathen rites or licentious banquets. Symmachus has, "to devise wicked devices."<p><span class= "bld">Dainties.--</span>The word is peculiar to this passage, but derived from a root meaning "pleasant." The LXX. and <span class= "ital">Vulg. </span>refer it to persons instead of things. But the use of the same root in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-6.htm" title="When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.">Psalm 141:6</a>, "for they are <span class= "ital">sweet," </span>where the reference is to "words," suggests a meaning here different both from the English and the ancient versions. "I will not taste of their sweets" may mean "I will not listen to their allurements: what finds favour with them shall not tempt me." On the other hand, if we retain the English allusion to the dainties of a feast (so Symmachus), the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-6.htm" title="When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.">Psalm 141:6</a> will be used metaphorically in contrast. The words of condemnation he utters, though bitter to these feasters, are in reality sweet with the sweetness of truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/141.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Incline not my heart to any evil thing</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. let not my heart be inclined to any form of evil. <span class="cmt_word">To practice wicked works</span> (rather, <span class="accented">wicked practices</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with men that work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties.

Those that know how to value God's gracious presence, will be the more fervent in their prayers. When presented through the sacrifice and intercession of the Saviour, they will be as acceptable to God as the daily sacrifices and burnings of incense were of old. Prayer is a spiritual sacrifice, it is the offering up the soul and its best affections. Good men know the evil of tongue sins. When enemies are provoking, we are in danger of speaking unadvisedly. While we live in an evil world, and have such evil hearts, we have need to pray that we may neither be drawn nor driven to do any thing sinful. Sinners pretend to find dainties in sin; but those that consider how soon sin will turn into bitterness, will dread such dainties, and pray to God to take them out of their sight, and by his grace to turn their hearts against them. Good men pray against the sweets of sin.</body></html>
