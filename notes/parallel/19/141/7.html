as also by the fact that the word here rendered "cleave" is that employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-12.htm" title="And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.">2Chronicles 25:12</a> (see reference above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-6.htm" title="When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.">Psalm 141:6</a>) of the Edomites thrown from the cliff. But the abrupt transition is not unlikely in Hebrew poetry, and the more difficult reading is according to rule to be preserved.<p>The figure is mistaken in the Authorised Version. The reference is not to the ground strewn with the logs left by a woodcutter, but to the clods of earth left by the plough. Keeping the present text, and making the figure refer to the righteous, we should naturally compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm" title="The plowers plowed on my back: they made long their furrows.">Psalm 129:3</a>, where ploughing is used as an image of affliction and torture, as "harrewing" is with us. The verse might be paraphrased: "We have been so harrowed and torn that we are brought to the brink of the grave," the image being, however, heightened by the recollection of some actual massacre.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/141.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth</span>.

"The bones of God's servants were strewn as thickly ever the ground as stones over a newly ploughed piece of soil, so that the Holy Land looked as if it had become an antechamber of Hades" (Kay). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/141.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>141:5-10 We should be ready to welcome the rebuke of our heavenly Father, and also the reproof of our brethren. It shall not break my head, if it may but help to break my heart: we must show that we take it kindly. Those who slighted the word of God before, will be glad of it when in affliction, for that opens the ear to instruction. When the world is bitter, the word is sweet. Let us lift our prayer unto God. Let us entreat him to rescue us from the snares of Satan, and of all the workers of iniquity. In language like this psalm, O Lord, would we entreat that our poor prayers should set forth our only hope, our only dependence on thee. Grant us thy grace, that we may be prepared for this employment, being clothed with thy righteousness, and having all the gifts of thy Spirit planted in our hearts.</body></html>
