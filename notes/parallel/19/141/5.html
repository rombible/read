Render, <span class= "ital">Let a righteous man smite me, it is a kindness; and let him reprove me, it is oil for the head: my head shall not refuse it though it continue; yet my prayer is against their wickedness.</span><p>The word rendered "smite" is that used of Jael's "hammer strokes "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm" title="She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.">Judges 5:26</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm" title="So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.">Isaiah 41:7</a>.) The Hebrew for "reprove" is probably used in a judicial sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-37.htm" title="Whereas you have searched all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may judge between us both.">Genesis 31:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm" title="And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-25.htm" title="But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come on them.">Proverbs 24:25</a>, &c. The greatest obscurity attaches to the word rendered above "refuse," but in the Authorised Version "break," probably because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-10.htm" title="The LORD brings the counsel of the heathen to nothing: he makes the devices of the people of none effect.">Psalm 33:10</a> (" bring to none effect") it is in parallelism with "break." The LXX. and Vulg. take it as meaning "anoint," rendering (from a different text to ours) "let not oil of a wicked man anoint my head." If we might adopt this reading it would remove the difficulty of this part of the verse, and give an excellent parallelism: "A righteous man may smite me in mercy and reprove me, but let not a wicked man's oil anoint my head;" i.e., I would welcome reproof from the righteous, but reject even the festive oil offered by the wicked. For the rendering "wickednesses," instead of "calamities," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-12.htm" title="Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;">Job 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-23.htm" title="And he shall bring on them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yes, the LORD our God shall cut them off.">Psalm 94:23</a>. For the sense of "although" given to the conjunction, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:">Exodus 13:17</a>. The suffix "their" <span class= "ital">refers </span>back, of course, to the <span class= "ital">ungodly </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-4.htm" title="Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.">Psalm 141:4</a>. The "oil for the head" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>) is a natural emblem of festivity, and the whole sentiment of the passage is tolerably clear. Rather than join in the wicked mirth of a profane banquet, the poet would be the object of continued rebuke and chastisement from one of the godly--his prayer meanwhile still rising for protection against the allurements held out to tempt him. We probably have sketched here the actual condition of many a Levite between the apostate and the loyal part of the nation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/141.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">let the righteous smite me kindly</span>, as in the margin. <span class="cmt_word">And let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which my head shall not refuse</span>. The psalmist will prefer the reproof of the righteous to the dainty allurements of the wicked. He will regard their words as an oil of welcome, such as was poured upon the head of favored guests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-36.htm">Luke 7:36</a>), and his head will not <span class="accented">refuse</span> it. <span class="cmt_word">For yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">their wickednesses</span>. This healing oil will strengthen him to continue to pray for his enemies, even though they still continue in their "wickednesses." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/141.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>141:5-10 We should be ready to welcome the rebuke of our heavenly Father, and also the reproof of our brethren. It shall not break my head, if it may but help to break my heart: we must show that we take it kindly. Those who slighted the word of God before, will be glad of it when in affliction, for that opens the ear to instruction. When the world is bitter, the word is sweet. Let us lift our prayer unto God. Let us entreat him to rescue us from the snares of Satan, and of all the workers of iniquity. In language like this psalm, O Lord, would we entreat that our poor prayers should set forth our only hope, our only dependence on thee. Grant us thy grace, that we may be prepared for this employment, being clothed with thy righteousness, and having all the gifts of thy Spirit planted in our hearts.</body></html>
