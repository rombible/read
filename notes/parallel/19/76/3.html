The image may be derived from the lightning speed of the flight of arrows, or from the custom of shooting bolts tipped with flame (see Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm" title="He has also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordains his arrows against the persecutors.">Psalm 7:13</a>), or the connection may be from the metaphor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/91-5.htm" title="You shall not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flies by day;">Psalm 91:5-6</a>, since the Hebrew word here used denotes pestilence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-5.htm" title="Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.">Habakkuk 3:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The shield, the sword, and the battle</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm" title="And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.">Hosea 2:18</a> is the original of this. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-9.htm" title="He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in sunder; he burns the chariot in the fire.">Psalm 46:9</a>.)

The expression "there" seems certainly to show that the deliverance celebrated took place at, or very near to, Jerusalem. This would sufficiently suit the destruction of Sennacherib's army, which certainly occurred in the neighbourhood, though not very close to the city (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a>, 38). The word translated "arrows" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e4;&#x5d9;</span>) means properly "lightnings" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-48.htm">Psalm 78:48</a>), and expresses the swift flight of the arrow, not actual "fiery darts." <span class="cmt_word">The shield, and the sword, and the battle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the war equipment</span> (Kay, Cheyne). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/76.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>76:1-6 Happy people are those who have their land filled with the knowledge of God! happy persons that have their hearts filled with that knowledge!
