The attention of the nations of Western Asia generally was attracted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>), and their minds were affected with a wholesome fear of Jehovah. The result was that they remained at rest and gave Israel rest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/76.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>76:7-12 God's people are the meek of the earth, the quiet in the land, that suffer wrong, but do none. The righteous God seems to keep silence long, yet, sooner or later, he will make judgment to be heard. We live in an angry, provoking world; we often feel much, and are apt to fear more, from the wrath of man. What will not turn to his praise, shall not be suffered to break out. He can set bounds to the wrath of man, as he does to the raging sea; hitherto it shall come, and no further. Let all submit to God. Our prayers and praises, and especially our hearts, are the presents we should bring to the Lord. His name is glorious, and he is the proper object of our fear. He shall cut off the spirit of princes; he shall slip it off easily, as we slip off a flower from the stalk, or a bunch of grapes from the vine; so the word signifies. He can dispirit the most daring: since there is no contending with God, it is our wisdom, as it is our duty, to submit to him. Let us seek his favour as our portion, and commit all our concerns to him.</body></html>
