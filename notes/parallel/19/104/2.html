Not only is light as to the modern poet,<p>"Nature's resplendent robe,<p>Without whose vesting beauty all were wrapt<p>In unessential gloom,"<p>but it is the dress of <span class= "ital">Divinity, </span>the "ethereal woof" that God Himself is for ever weaving for His own wear.<p><span class= "bld">Curtain.</span>--Especially of a <span class= "ital">tent </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-5.htm" title="I am black, but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.">Song of Solomon 1:5</a>, &c.), the tremulous movement of its folds being expressed in the Hebrew word. Different explanations have been given of the figure. Some see an allusion to the curtains of the Tabernacle (Exodus 26, 27). The associations of this ritual were dear to a religious Hebrew, and he may well have had in his mind the rich folds of the curtain of the Holy of Holies. So a modern poet speaks of<p>"The arras-folds, that variegate<p>The earth, God's ante-chamber.<p>Herder, again, refers the image to the survival of the nomadic instinct. But there is no need to put a limit to a figure so natural and suggestive. Possibly images of palace, temple, and tent, all combined, rose to the poet's thought, as in Shelley's "Ode to Heaven":--<p>"Palace roof of cloudless nights!<p>Paradise of golden lights!<p>Deep immeasurable vast,<p>Which art now, and which wert then;<p>Of the present and the past,<p>Of the Eternal where and when,<p>Presence-chamber, temple, home,<p>Ever-canopying dome<p>Of acts and ages yet to come!"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment.</span> Light was the first thing created (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>), before either the heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-8</a>) or the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9, 10</a>). In light God, the invisible, as it were, enshrouds himself, making it the image of his hidden glory. <span class="cmt_word">Who</span> <span class="cmt_word">stretchest out the heavens like a curtain</span>; or, "a canopy" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>).
