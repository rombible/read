The truth seems to be that from a religious hymn of Israel, since religion and patriotism were one, the expression of the national feeling against heathen oppressors and apostates who sided with them could not well be absent, whatever its immediate subject and tone. But the poet touches even a profounder truth.<span class= "note">[19]</span> The harmony of creation was soon broken by sin, and the harmony of the song of creation would hardly be complete, or rather, would be false and unreal, did not a discord make itself heard. The form such a suggestion would take was conditioned by the nationality of the poet; the spirit of it brings this ancient hymn at its close into accord with the feeling of modern literature, as reflected in Wordsworth's well-known "Verses Written in Early Spring":--<p><span class= "note">[19] In reality the power of sin to interfere with God's pleasure. in His universe is present as an undercurrent of thought in Psalms 103, as well as 104.
