Just as He makes the clouds serve as a chariot and the sky as a tent, so he employs the winds as messengers and the lightnings as servants.<p>Taken quite alone, the construction and arrangement of the verse favours the interpretation of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>, Note, <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>This was the traditional Jewish interpretation, and on it were founded various theories of angelic agency.<p>But not only do the exigencies of the context set aside this interpretation, but Hebrew literature offers enough instances to show that the order in which a poet arranged his words was comparatively immaterial. Indeed, Dean Perowne has adduced two instances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-26.htm" title="Have you not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste defended cities into ruinous heaps.">Isaiah 37:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-18.htm" title="Violence shall no more be heard in your land, wasting nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.">Isaiah 60:18</a>) of precisely similar inversion of the natural order of immediate object and predicate. (See <span class= "ital">Expositor, </span>December, 1878.) And no difficulty need be made about the change of number in <span class= "ital">flame of fire </span>and <span class= "ital">ministers, </span>since even if the former were not synonymous with <span class= "ital">lightnings, </span>its predicate might be plural. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-14.htm" title="The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.">Proverbs 16:14</a>, "The <span class= "ital">wrath </span>of a king is <span class= "ital">messengers </span>of death.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who maketh his angels</span> <span class="cmt_word">spirits.</span> Professor Cheyne renders, "Who maketh his messengers of winds;" and so (in substance) Jarchi, Aben. Ezra, Rosenmuller, Professor Alexander, and even Hengstenberg. The difficulty in adopting this rendering is that furnished by the application of the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>; but the arguments of Hengstenberg go far to meet that difficulty. It is to be noted that our Revisers, while admitting either rendering, have preferred that of Professor Cheyne. <span class="cmt_word">And his ministers a flaming fire;</span> or, "his ministers of flame and fire." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>104:1-9 Every object we behold calls on us to bless and praise the Lord, who is great.
