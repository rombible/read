We must not here think of the later theological doctrine of the Holy Spirit. The psalmist evidently regards the breath of God only as the vivifying power that gives matter a distinct and individual, but transient, existence. Even in the speculative book of Ecclesiastes, the idea of a human soul having a permanent separate existence does not make its appearance. At death the dust, no longer animate, returns to the earth as it was, and the breath, which had given it life, returns to God who gave it--gave it as an emanation, to be resumed unto Himself when its work was done. Still less, then, must we look in poetry for any more developed doctrine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou sendest forth thy spirit;</span> or, <span class="accented">thy breath.</span> As God "breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), so it is an effluence from him that gives life to every living thing. <span class="cmt_word">They are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</span> As after the Deluge (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-17.htm">Genesis 8:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>104:19-30 We are to praise and magnify God for the constant succession of day and night. And see how those are like to the wild beasts, who wait for the twilight, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenous creatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language of grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings which cannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be done in its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he must continue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night comes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works of God. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the more rough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. They are all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designed to serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a new world rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alone lives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soul enters on another state, and his body will be raised, either to glory or to misery. May the Lord send forth his Spirit, and new-create our souls to holiness.</body></html>
