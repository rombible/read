The sun is no mere mechanical timepiece to the Israelite poet, but a conscious servant of God. How beautifully this mention of sunset prepares the way for the exquisite picture of the nocturnal landscape, as the sunrise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-22.htm" title="The sun rises, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.">Psalm 104:22</a> does for the landscape of the day.<p>In Genesis the creation of the "heavenly bodies"--the fourth day's work--is related in, so to speak, a scientific manner. But the poet, as in the former part of his treatment of the subject, at once goes to the influence of these phenomena on animated being. In Genesis the lamps of heaven are, as it were, hung out at God's command; in the poem they seem to move to their office of guiding the seasons and illuminating the earth like living things who are conscious of the glorious function they have to perform.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He appointed the moon for seasons</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>). The Jewish festivals depended greatly on the moon, the Passover being celebrated at the time of the full moon of the first month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>), and the other festivals depending mostly on the Passover. <span class="cmt_word">And the sun knoweth his going down.</span> Observes the laws, that is to say, appointed for him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>104:19-30 We are to praise and magnify God for the constant succession of day and night. And see how those are like to the wild beasts, who wait for the twilight, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenous creatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language of grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings which cannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be done in its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he must continue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night comes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works of God. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the more rough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. They are all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designed to serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a new world rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alone lives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soul enters on another state, and his body will be raised, either to glory or to misery. May the Lord send forth his Spirit, and new-create our souls to holiness.</body></html>
