David's adversaries were cunning, treacherous, and quite regardless of truth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-7.htm">2 Samuel 15:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>, etc.). God's vengeance was sure to fall upon them, either in this world or in the next. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man</span>. An individual seems to be pointed at, who is probably Ahithophel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 God is a prayer-hearing God. Such he has always been, and he is still as ready to hear prayer as ever. The most encouraging principle of prayer, and the most powerful plea in prayer, is, to look upon him as our King and our God. David also prays to a sin-hating God. sin is folly, and sinners are the greatest of all fools; fools of their own making. Wicked people hate God; justly are they hated of him, and this will be their endless misery and ruin. Let us learn the importance of truth and sincerity, in all the affairs of life. Liars and murderers resemble the devil, and are his children, therefore it may well be expected that God should abhor them. These were the characters of David's enemies; and such as these are still the enemies of Christ and his people.</body></html>
