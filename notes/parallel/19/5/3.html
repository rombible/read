The word "direct," or, better, <span class= "ital">prepare, </span>is the same employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-8.htm" title="And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:">Leviticus 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-12.htm" title="And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:">Leviticus 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-12.htm" title="And the fire on the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order on it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.">Leviticus 6:12</a>, of the priest laying out the wood for the sacrifice, or the parts of the offering itself, and suggest that the author may himself have been a priest. The word "offering" should be supplied, instead of "prayer." Henry Vaughan's fine hymn--<p>"When first thine eyes unveil, give thy soul leave<p>To do the like"--<p>was probably suggested by this verse.<p><span class= "bld">Look up.</span>--The Hebrew is from the root which forms "Mizpeh," or "watch-tower." The psalmist looks up for the answer to his prayer as the seer on his tower (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm" title="I will stand on my watch, and set me on the tower, and will watch to see what he will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.">Habakkuk 2:1</a>) looked up for his inspiration. The usual attitude of prayer in the East was then, as now, either standing or prostrate, the hands lifted up or spread out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-33.htm" title="And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.">Exodus 9:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm" title="Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry to you, when I lift up my hands toward your holy oracle.">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-2.htm" title="Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.">Psalm 134:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm" title="Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.">Psalm 141:2</a>). To raise the eyes was not so usual. Virgil, describing the capture of Cassandra by the Greeks, makes her look up, but only because her hands were bound.<p>"Ad coelum tendens ardentia lumina frustra,<p>Lumina--nam teneras arcebant vincula palmas."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord</span> (compare "At evening, and <span class="accented">at morning</span>, and at noonday will I pray, and he shall hear my voice," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-13.htm">Psalm 88:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-147.htm">Psalm 119:147</a>). The appointment of daily morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>) pointed out morn and eve as times especially appropriate for prayer. A natural instinct suggested the same idea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>). In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee. The repetition adds force to the implied injunction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-6.htm">Psalm 130:6</a>). The word translated "direct my prayer" means "arrange" or "set in order," as the priests did the altar before a sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7, 8, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>). Prayer is viewed as a sort of sacrificial act. And will look up; or, <span class="accented">look out</span> - keep on the watch - in expectation of my prayer being granted (see the Revised Version). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 God is a prayer-hearing God. Such he has always been, and he is still as ready to hear prayer as ever. The most encouraging principle of prayer, and the most powerful plea in prayer, is, to look upon him as our King and our God. David also prays to a sin-hating God. sin is folly, and sinners are the greatest of all fools; fools of their own making. Wicked people hate God; justly are they hated of him, and this will be their endless misery and ruin. Let us learn the importance of truth and sincerity, in all the affairs of life. Liars and murderers resemble the devil, and are his children, therefore it may well be expected that God should abhor them. These were the characters of David's enemies; and such as these are still the enemies of Christ and his people.</body></html>
