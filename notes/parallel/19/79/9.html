God is still the God of Israel's salvation, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the God from whom alone salvation can be obtained and may be expected. He is entreated to come to Israel's aid, not for their sakes, as they are wholly undeserving, but for his own glory (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>; and Exodus 32:27). <span class="cmt_word">And deliver us, and purge away our sins;</span> literally, <span class="accented">make atonement for our sins</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-15.htm">Exodus 30:15</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "cancel them" (Cheyne), or "forgive them" (Hengstenberg, Kay). <span class="cmt_word">For thy Name's sake</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-11.htm">Psalm 25:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/79.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>79:6-13 Those who persist in ignorance of God, and neglect of prayer, are the ungodly. How unrighteous soever men were, the Lord was righteous in permitting them to do what they did. Deliverances from trouble are mercies indeed, when grounded upon the pardon of sin; we should therefore be more earnest in prayer for the removal of our sins than for the removal of afflictions. They had no hopes but from God's mercies, his tender mercies. They plead no merit, they pretend to none, but, Help us for the glory of thy name; pardon us for thy name's sake. The Christian forgets not that he is often bound in the chain of his sins. The world to him is a prison; sentence of death is passed upon him, and he knows not how soon it may be executed. How fervently should he at all times pray, O let the sighing of a prisoner come before thee, according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die! How glorious will the day be, when, triumphant over sin and sorrow, the church beholds the adversary disarmed for ever! while that church shall, from age to age, sing the praises of her great Shepherd and Bishop, her King and her God.</body></html>
