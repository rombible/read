The context seems certainly to require the meaning "before it is plucked up," and many scholars get this meaning out of the Hebrew verb used elsewhere of "plucking off a shoe" and "drawing a sword." They give, which is no doubt legitimate, an impersonal sense to the active verb, "which withereth before one pulls it up." The LXX. (received text), the Vulg., Theodotion, and the Quinta favour this rendering. On the other hand, the image of grass withering before it comes to maturity is exactly what we should expect here, growing as it does without soil (comp. the "seed on the rock" in the parable of the sower), and suggests a more complete and sudden destruction of the enemies, who perish before the abortive plans of evil can be carried out. The rendering of the Authorised Version is therefore to be retained, and is actually supported by Aquila, Symmachus, the Sexta, and in various readings of the LXX. A thatched cottage in our country might present the picture suggested by the verse, but it was much more familiar where the housetops were flat and plastered with a composition of mortar, tar, ashes, and sand, which, unless carefully rolled, would naturally become covered with weeds. Indeed, in many cases, especially on the poorest sort of houses, the roof would be little better than hard mud. For similar allusions comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-26.htm" title="Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.">2Kings 19:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-27.htm" title="Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.">Isaiah 37:27</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/129.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them be as the grass upon the housetops</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they shall be as the grass of housetops</span>. The fiat roofs of Oriental houses are usually covered in early spring with a crop of bright-green grass. But the scorching rays of the sun soon burn this up, and it becomes dry and withered (see 'The Land and the Book,' p. 682; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-27.htm">Isaiah 37:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which withereth afore it groweth up</span>; literally, <span class="accented">before it is unsheathed</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. before the blossom has left the sheath in which it is formed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/129.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>129:5-8 While God's people shall flourish as the loaded palm-tree, or the green and fruitful olive, their enemies shall wither as the grass upon the house-tops, which in eastern countries are flat, and what grows there never ripens; so it is with the designs of God's enemies. No wise man will pray the Lord to bless these mowers or reapers. And when we remember how Jesus arose and reigns; how his people have been supported, like the burning but unconsumed bush, we shall not fear.</body></html>
