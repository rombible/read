"Half a furrow of an acre of land," as a space in which twenty men were killed, gives no clear idea to the mind. But Dr. J. G. Wettstein, in his excursus at the end of Delitzsch's Commentary, explains the <span class= "ital">ma'an </span>to be the strip of ground which the ploughman takes in hand at one time, and round which consequently at the end of each furrow the plough turns. Delitzsch's "furrow-strip," therefore, more exactly reproduces the word, though here doubtless it is used with a poetic freedom and may be translated <span class= "ital">furrow. </span>The double image, suggesting the lash given to a slave, and at the same time the actual and terrible imprints of oppression left on the country as well as the race, is as striking as poetry ever produced. It, in fact, combines two separate prophetic figures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm" title="From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.">Isaiah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-23.htm" title="But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict you; which have said to your soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and you have laid your body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.">Isaiah 51:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/129.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The plowers plowed upon my back</span>. A strong metaphor, which does not elsewhere occur. The idea is perhaps taken from the cruel treatment of captives in those days, who, in certain cases, were "put under saws and harrows of iron" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>), or, as it is elsewhere expressed, "threshed with threshing instruments of iron" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They made long their furrows</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.
