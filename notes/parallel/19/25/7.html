Job thought that God counted against him the "iniquities of his youth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>); David, with greater faith and a deeper insight into the true character of God, can ask with confidence that his may not be reckoned against him.

How much less will our heavenly Father! <span class="cmt_word">According to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, O Lord!</span> Still, put me not from thy mind. "Remember thou me" always - but in the light of thy tender mercy, with the rays of thy love streaming over me and hiding the deformities of my transgressions. Do this "for thy goodness' sake," <span class="accented">i.e. because</span> thou art essential Goodness, perfect Tenderness, perfect Love. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 In worshipping God, we must lift up our souls to him. It is certain that none who, by a believing attendance, wait on God, and, by a believing hope, wait for him, shall be ashamed of it. The most advanced believer both needs and desires to be taught of God. If we sincerely desire to know our duty, with resolution to do it, we may be sure that God will direct us in it. The psalmist is earnest for the pardon of his sins. When God pardons sin, he is said to remember it no more, which denotes full remission. It is God's goodness, and not ours, his mercy, and not our merit, that must be our plea for the pardon of sin, and all the good we need. This plea we must rely upon, feeling our own unworthiness, and satisfied of the riches of God's mercy and grace. How boundless is that mercy which covers for ever the sins and follies of a youth spent without God and without hope! Blessed be the Lord, the blood of the great Sacrifice can wash away every stain.</body></html>
