The psalmist here resumes the attitude of prayer, which he had laid aside in ver. 8. The" sins of his youth," and his other "transgressions," which he had asked God to forget (ver. 7), rankle in his own memory, and force him to cry out again and again for pardon (see ver. 18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-8.htm">Psalm 39:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a>, etc.). Here he beseeches God to pardon him "for his Name's sake," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the honour of his Name, that his mercy may Be known far and wide, and his goodness cause all the world to praise him. He enforces his plea by the confession, For it (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his iniquity) is great; so great, that his need of forgiveness is excessive: so great, that to forgive it will be truly Godlike; so great, that, unless forgiven, he must be lost. (For his "great sin," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4-17</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-14 We are all sinners; and Christ came into the world to save sinners, to teach sinners, to call sinners to repentance. We value a promise by the character of him that makes it; we therefore depend upon God's promises. All the paths of the Lord, that is, all his promises and all his providences, are mercy and truth. In all God's dealings his people may see his mercy displayed, and his word fulfilled, whatever afflictions they are now exercised with. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth; and so it will appear when they come to their journey's end. Those that are humble, that distrust themselves, and desire to be taught and to follow Divine guidance, these he will guide in judgment, that is, by the rule of the written word, to find rest for their souls in the Saviour. Even when the body is sick, and in pain, the soul may be at ease in God.</body></html>
