An echo of the prayer of Moses when his people were rebellious at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>), reiterated by David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>, and perhaps again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-11.htm">Psalm 86:11</a> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-33.htm">Psalm 119:33</a>). Man is so wanting in spiritual understanding, so morally blind and ignorant, that, unless enlightened from on high, he cannot discern aright the "way of godliness;" he does not know at any given moment what God would have him to do. Hence it is the constant prayer of every religious man that God will "lighten his darkness;" "make his way plain before his face;" "show him the path that he should walk in;" enable him to see, if no more, at any rate the next step which it is his duty to take. The idea has been beautifully expressed by a modern poet - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom<br />Lead thou me on.<br />The night is dark, and I am far from homo;<br />Lead thou me on.<br />Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see<br />The distant scene; one step enough for me."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 In worshipping God, we must lift up our souls to him. It is certain that none who, by a believing attendance, wait on God, and, by a believing hope, wait for him, shall be ashamed of it. The most advanced believer both needs and desires to be taught of God. If we sincerely desire to know our duty, with resolution to do it, we may be sure that God will direct us in it. The psalmist is earnest for the pardon of his sins. When God pardons sin, he is said to remember it no more, which denotes full remission. It is God's goodness, and not ours, his mercy, and not our merit, that must be our plea for the pardon of sin, and all the good we need. This plea we must rely upon, feeling our own unworthiness, and satisfied of the riches of God's mercy and grace. How boundless is that mercy which covers for ever the sins and follies of a youth spent without God and without hope! Blessed be the Lord, the blood of the great Sacrifice can wash away every stain.</body></html>
