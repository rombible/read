Shall the dust praise you? shall it declare your truth?">Psalm 30:9</a>, the sufferer urges as a further reason for Divine aid the loss Jehovah would suffer by the cessation of his praise. The Israelite's natural dread of death was intensified by the thought that the grave separated him from all the privileges of the covenant with God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18</a>.) There can be neither remembrance of His past mercies there, nor confession of His greatness. The word translated <span class= "ital">grave, </span>in exact parallelism with <span class= "ital">death, </span>is <span class= "ital">sheol, </span>or <span class= "ital">underworld, </span>in the early conception merely a vast sepulchral cave, closed as rock-tombs usually were by gates of stone or iron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-10.htm" title="I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.">Isaiah 38:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm" title="They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.">Job 17:16</a>). The derivation of the word is disputed, but the primary meaning appears to have been <span class= "ital">hollowness. </span>It occurs sixty-five times in the Bible, and is rendered in the Authorised version three times "pit," and then with curious impartiality thirty-one times "grave," and as many "hell." When it ceased to be merely a synonym for "grave," and began to gather a new set of ideas we cannot ascertain. It was before the time of which we have any contemporary records. But it acquired these new ideas very slowly. <span class= "ital">Sheol </span>was for a very long time only a magnified grave, into which all the dead, bad and good alike, prince and peasant, went; where they lay side by side in their niches, as the dead do in the loculi of eastern tombs now, without sense of light or sound, or any influence from the upper world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-2.htm" title="I go the way of all the earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a man;">1Kings 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-23.htm" title="For I know that you will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.">Job 30:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-48.htm" title="What man is he that lives, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.">Psalm 89:48</a>). It is something more than death, put it is not life. The "sleep of death" expresses it. As in Homer's Hades, the dead are men without the minds or energies of men--"soulless men; so the dead in the Hebrew conception are <span class= "ital">rephaim, </span>that is, weak, shadowy existences. Indeed, the Biblical representation is even less tolerable than the Greek. Homer's heroes retain many of their interests in the living world; they rejoice in the prosperity of their friends--their own approval or disapproval makes a difference to those still on earth--and, apart from this continued connection with the upper air, they had gone to a realm of their own, with its sovereign lord, its laws and customs, its sanctions, and penalties. Not so in the Jewish belief--"the dead know not anything"; "there is no wisdom in sheol." It would be of no use for God to show any wonders among those incapable of perceiving them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm" title="For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.">Ecclesiastes 9:5-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm" title="Will you show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise you? Selah.">Psalm 88:10</a>). They have passed altogether from all the interests and relations of life, even from the covenant relation with Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm" title="The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.">Psalm 115:17</a>.) How the Hebrew conscience, helped, possibly, by the influence of foreign ideas, gradually struggled into a higher light on these subjects, belongs to the history of eschatology. The fact that Psalms 6 reflects the earlier undeveloped doctrine, is an argument against any very late date for it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in death there is no remembrance of thee</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-17.htm">Psalm 118:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>). The general view of the psalmists seems to have been that death was a cessation of the active service of God - whether for a time or permanently, they do not make clear to us. So even Hezekiah, in the passage of Isaiah above quoted. Death is represented as a sleep (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>), but whether there is an awakening from it does not appear. No doubt, as has been said ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 182), "the cessation of active service, even of remembrance or devotion, does not affect the question of a future restoration," and the metaphor of sleep certainly suggests the idea of an awakening. But such a veil hung over the other world, under the old dispensation, and over the condition of the departed in it, that thought was scarcely exercised upon the subject. Men's duties in this life were what occupied them, and they did not realize that in another they would have employments - much less form any notion of what those employments would be. The grave seemed a place of silence, inaction, tranquillity. <span class="cmt_word">In the grave</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">in Sheol</span>) <span class="cmt_word">who shall give thee thanks?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17, 18</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 These verses speak the language of a heart truly humbled, of a broken and contrite spirit under great afflictions, sent to awaken conscience and mortify corruption. Sickness brought sin to his remembrance, and he looked upon it as a token of God's displeasure against him. The affliction of his body will be tolerable, if he has comfort in his soul. Christ's sorest complaint, in his sufferings, was of the trouble of his soul, and the want of his Father's smiles. Every page of Scripture proclaims the fact, that salvation is only of the Lord. Man is a sinner, his case can only be reached by mercy; and never is mercy more illustrious than in restoring backsliders. With good reason we may pray, that if it be the will of God, and he has any further work for us or our friends to do in this world, he will yet spare us or them to serve him. To depart and be with Christ is happiest for the saints; but for them to abide in the flesh is more profitable for the church.</body></html>
