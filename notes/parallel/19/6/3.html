It is not, however, the body alone which suffers; the soul also is vexed, and vexed greatly (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span>). Clearly the main emphasis is intended to be laid on the mental suffering. But thou, O Lord, how long! We may fill up the ellipse in various ways: "How long wilt thou look on?" "How long wilt thou hide thyself?" "How long wilt thou be angry?" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-46.htm">Psalm 89:46</a>). Or again, "How long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a>). The cry is that of one wearied out with long suffering (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 These verses speak the language of a heart truly humbled, of a broken and contrite spirit under great afflictions, sent to awaken conscience and mortify corruption. Sickness brought sin to his remembrance, and he looked upon it as a token of God's displeasure against him. The affliction of his body will be tolerable, if he has comfort in his soul. Christ's sorest complaint, in his sufferings, was of the trouble of his soul, and the want of his Father's smiles. Every page of Scripture proclaims the fact, that salvation is only of the Lord. Man is a sinner, his case can only be reached by mercy; and never is mercy more illustrious than in restoring backsliders. With good reason we may pray, that if it be the will of God, and he has any further work for us or our friends to do in this world, he will yet spare us or them to serve him. To depart and be with Christ is happiest for the saints; but for them to abide in the flesh is more profitable for the church.</body></html>
