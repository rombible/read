Gesenius and Ewald give a different sense to the word <span class= "ital">pour, </span>and follow Symmachus in translating <span class= "ital">anointed, </span>which agrees well with the mention of the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm" title="He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.">Psalm 2:4</a>). The LXX. and Vulg. have "but I was appointed king by him," making the Anointed begin his speech here, instead of at the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion</span>; literally, and as for me, I have set my King upon Zion, the mount of my holiness. The words are uttered by Jehovah, and must refer to the Anointed One of ver. 2. This Anointed One God has set up as King upon Zion, his holy mountain. Without denying some reference to David, the type, we must regard the Anti-type, Christ, as mainly pointed at. Christ is set up for ever as King in the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1 5</a>). There is no need to substitute "anointed" for "set" or" set up," as is done by Rosenmuller, Gesenius, Ewald, Zuuz, Umbreit, and others, since <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5e1;&#x5da;</span> has both meanings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-23.htm">Proverbs 8:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-6 We are here told who would appear as adversaries to Christ. As this world is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party, and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. But the rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths and precepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldly lusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They would break asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God's commandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as they can. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holy a government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven upon earth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful a kingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, and is Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies. Christ's throne is set up in his church, that is, in the hearts of all believers.</body></html>
