God "laughs" at the vain and futile efforts of man to escape from the control of his laws and throw off his dominion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-13.htm">Psalm 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-8.htm">Psalm 59:8</a>).

"Laughter" and "derision" are, of course, anthropo-morphisms. It is meant that God views with contempt and scorn man's weak attempts at rebellion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-6 We are here told who would appear as adversaries to Christ. As this world is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party, and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. But the rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths and precepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldly lusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They would break asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God's commandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as they can. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holy a government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven upon earth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful a kingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, and is Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies. Christ's throne is set up in his church, that is, in the hearts of all believers.</body></html>
