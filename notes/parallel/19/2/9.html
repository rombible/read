(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-37.htm" title="And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:">Ezekiel 20:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm" title="Feed your people with your rod, the flock of your heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the middle of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.">Micah 7:14</a>.) Elsewhere the rod is a sceptre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-3.htm" title="For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands to iniquity.">Psalm 125:3</a>); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-15.htm" title="Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.">Proverbs 22:15</a> it is a rod of correction. The use to be made of it--<span class= "ital">to</span> <span class= "ital">dash the nations in pieces, as one breaks a potter's vessel</span>--points to the latter of these significations here.<p>"Then shalt thou bring full low<p>With iron sceptre bruised, and them disperse<p>Like to a potter's vessel shivered so." (<span class= "ital">Milton's trans.</span>)<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-10.htm" title="Be wise now therefore, O you kings: be instructed, you judges of the earth.">Psalm 2:10</a> begins the fourth section of the poem. Subject princes are warned to be wise in time, and, as a religious duty as well as a political necessity, to submit to Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">Rejoice with trembling.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">quake, </span>referring to the motion of the body produced by strong emotion, and therefore used both of joy and terror. Our version follows the LXX.; most of the old versions paraphrase the word: Chaldean, "pray"; Syriac," cleave to him"; Arabic, "praise him." It is historically interesting to remember that the words of this verse--<span class= "ital">et nunc reges intelligite</span>--formed the legend of the medal struck in England after the execution of Charles I.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron</span>. It is said that these words, and those of the next clause, "cannot describe the mild rule of Christ" (Rosenmuller, Do Wette, Hupfeld, etc.). But the objectors forget that there is a severe, as well as a mild, side to the dealings of God with his human creatures. St. Paul notes in the same verse both the "severity" and the "goodness" of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>). Christ, though "the Prince of Peace," "came to send a sword upon the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>). As the appointed Judge of men, he takes vengeance on the wicked, while he rewards the righteous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-17.htm">Luke 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>). Nay, St. John, in the Apocalypse, declares that "out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations. and "<span class="accented">ye shall rule them with a rod of iron"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>; comp. 2:27; 12:5). So, with respect to the other clause of the verse - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel</span> - it is to be noted that there is a similar threat made by the Lord of hosts against Jerusalem in the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 19:11), and that under the new covenant the same is threatened in the Revelation (Revelation 2:27). In truth, both covenants are alike in denouncing the extreme of God's wrath on impenitent sinners, such as those here spoken of. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:7-9 The kingdom of the Messiah is founded upon an eternal decree of God the Father. This our Lord Jesus often referred to, as what he governed himself by. God hath said unto him, Thou art my Son, and it becomes each of us to say to him, Thou art my Lord, my Sovereign'. The Son, in asking the heathen for his inheritance, desires their happiness in him; so that he pleads for them, ever lives to do so, and is able to save to the uttermost, and he shall have multitudes of willing, loyal subjects, among them. Christians are the possession of the Lord Jesus; they are to him for a name and a praise. God the Father gives them to him, when, by his Spirit and grace, he works upon them to submit to the Lord Jesus.</body></html>
