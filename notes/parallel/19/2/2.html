Its distinctive reference to an expected prince of the chosen people, who was to redeem them from their enemies, and fulfil completely all the Divine promises for them, probably dates from this psalm, or more distinctly from this psalm than from any one passage. At least, that the traditional Jewish interpretation had fastened upon it as of this importance is shown by the frequent and emphatic quotation of this psalm in the New Testament. (See New Testament use of these verses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-25.htm" title="Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?">Acts 4:25</a>, and Note in <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The kings of the earth set themselves</span>; or<span class="accented">, draw themselves up in array</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-4.htm">Jeremiah 46:4</a>). Such kings as Herod the Great, Herod Agrippa, Nero, Galerius, Diocletian, Julian the Apostate, etc. There is always a warfare between the world and the Church, in which kings are apt to take a part, most often on the worldly side. And the rulers take counsel together. "Rulers" are persons having authority, but below the rank of kings Such were the ethnarchs and tetrarchs of the first century, the governors of provinces under the Roman emperor, the members of the Jewish Sanhedrin, and the like. These last frequently "took counsel against the Lord" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3 - 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-5.htm">Acts 4:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-21.htm">Acts 5:21-41</a>). Against the Lord, and against his Anointed, saying. In David's time the recognized "anointed of the Lord" was the divinely appointed King of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-7.htm">1 Samuel 26:7, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14, 16</a>: 19:21; 22:51; Psalm 17:50; 20:6; 28:8) - first Saul, and then David; but David here seems to designate by the term a Greater than himself - the true theocratic King, whom he typified. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-6 We are here told who would appear as adversaries to Christ. As this world is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party, and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. But the rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths and precepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldly lusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They would break asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God's commandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as they can. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holy a government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven upon earth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful a kingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, and is Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies. Christ's throne is set up in his church, that is, in the hearts of all believers.</body></html>
