From the particular prince, of whose career, if we could identify him with certainty, this would be the noblest historical memorial, the Psalmist--if, indeed, any one historic personage was in his thought at all--let his thoughts and hopes range, as we certainly may, on to a larger and higher fulfilment. The figure of an <span class= "ital">ideal prince </span>who was always about to appear, but was never realised in any actual successor on the throne, may possibly, by the time of this psalm, have assumed its great place in the nation's prophetic hopes. Certainly the whole line of tradition claims the passage in a Messianic sense.

It is best to suppose that Messiah here takes the word, and maintains it to the end of ver. 9, when the psalmist resumes in his own person. Messiah "declares," or publishes, a "decree," made by God the Father in the beginning of all things, and communicated by him to the Son, whereby he made known the relationship between them, and invested the Son with sovereign power over the universe. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath said unto me</span>; rather, said unto me (see the Revised Version). It was said, once for all, at a distant date. Thou art my Son. Not "one of my sons,,' but "my Son;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my one Son, my only one - "my Son" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This day have I begotten thee</span>. If it be asked, "Which day?" the answer would seem to be, the day when Christ commenced his redemptive work: then the Father "committed all judgment" - "all dominion over creation" to the Son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), gave him, as it were, a new existence, a new sphere, the throne of the world, and of all that is or that ever will be, in it (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:7-9 The kingdom of the Messiah is founded upon an eternal decree of God the Father. This our Lord Jesus often referred to, as what he governed himself by. God hath said unto him, Thou art my Son, and it becomes each of us to say to him, Thou art my Lord, my Sovereign'. The Son, in asking the heathen for his inheritance, desires their happiness in him; so that he pleads for them, ever lives to do so, and is able to save to the uttermost, and he shall have multitudes of willing, loyal subjects, among them. Christians are the possession of the Lord Jesus; they are to him for a name and a praise. God the Father gives them to him, when, by his Spirit and grace, he works upon them to submit to the Lord Jesus.</body></html>
