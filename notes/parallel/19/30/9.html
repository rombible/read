God has "no pleasure in the death of him that dieth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>), and certainly can obtain no profit from the destruction of any of his creatures. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the dust praise thee?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>). In death, so far as the power of death extends, there can be no action; the lips cease to move, and therefore cannot hymn God's praise - the "dust" is inanimate, and, while it remains dust, cannot speak. What the freed soul may do, the psalmist does not consider. Very little was known under the old dispensation concerning the intermediate state. <span class="cmt_word">Shall it declare thy truth?</span> The dust certainly could not do this, unless revivified and formed into another living body. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:6-12 When things are well with us, we are very apt to think that they will always be so. When we see our mistake, it becomes us to think with shame upon our carnal security as our folly. If God hide his face, a good man is troubled, though no other calamity befal him. But if God, in wisdom and justice, turn from us, it will be the greatest folly if we turn from him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark. The sanctified spirit, which returns to God, shall praise him, shall be still praising him; but the services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust; it cannot praise him; there is none of that device or working in the grave, for it is the land of silence. We ask aright for life, when we do so that we may live to praise him. In due time God delivered the psalmist out of his troubles. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when employed in praising God. He would persevere to the end in praise, hoping that he should shortly be where this would be the everlasting work. But let all beware of carnal security. Neither outward prosperity, nor inward peace, here, are sure and lasting. The Lord, in his favour, has fixed the believer's safety firm as the deep-rooted mountains, but he must expect to meet with temptations and afflictions. When we grow careless, we fall into sin, the Lord hides his face, our comforts droop, and troubles assail us.</body></html>
