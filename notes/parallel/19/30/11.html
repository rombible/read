Suddenly, in a moment, all was changed. The angel ceased to slay. God bade him hold his hand. The Prophet Gad was sent with the joyful news to David, and commanded him at once to build an altar at Jehovah. Then the mourning ceased, and a joyful ceremonial was instituted, of which dancing, as so often, formed a part (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">put off</span> (rather, <span class="accented">didst put off</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>my sackcloth</span>. That the king had clothed himself in sackcloth on the occasion, is mentioned by the author of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>). And girded (<span class="accented">girdedst</span>) me with gladness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:6-12 When things are well with us, we are very apt to think that they will always be so. When we see our mistake, it becomes us to think with shame upon our carnal security as our folly. If God hide his face, a good man is troubled, though no other calamity befal him. But if God, in wisdom and justice, turn from us, it will be the greatest folly if we turn from him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark. The sanctified spirit, which returns to God, shall praise him, shall be still praising him; but the services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust; it cannot praise him; there is none of that device or working in the grave, for it is the land of silence. We ask aright for life, when we do so that we may live to praise him. In due time God delivered the psalmist out of his troubles. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when employed in praising God. He would persevere to the end in praise, hoping that he should shortly be where this would be the everlasting work. But let all beware of carnal security. Neither outward prosperity, nor inward peace, here, are sure and lasting. The Lord, in his favour, has fixed the believer's safety firm as the deep-rooted mountains, but he must expect to meet with temptations and afflictions. When we grow careless, we fall into sin, the Lord hides his face, our comforts droop, and troubles assail us.</body></html>
