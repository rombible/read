David continually calls upon the people to join him in his praises of God. Even when the mercy vouchsafed has been granted specially to himself, he regards the people as interested, since he is their ruler in peace and their leader in war (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-11.htm">Psalm 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>, etc.). On the present occasion, however, the people who had escaped the pestilence had almost exactly the same reason for praising and thanking God that David had, and were bound to join him in his thanksgiving service. And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness; literally, <span class="accented">give thanks to the memorial of his holiness</span>, which is explained, by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>, as meaning, "Give thanks to his holy Name" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-21.htm">Psalm 145:21</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/30.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>30:1-5. The great things the Lord has done for us, both by his providence and by his grace, bind us in gratitude to do all we can to advance his kingdom among men, though the most we can do is but little. God's saints in heaven sing to him; why should not those on earth do the same? Not one of all God's perfections carries in it more terror to the wicked, or more comfort to the godly, than his holiness. It is a good sign that we are in some measure partakers of his holiness, if we can heartily rejoice at the remembrance of it. Our happiness is bound up in the Divine favour; if we have that, we have enough, whatever else we want; but as long as God's anger continues, so long the saints' weeping continues.</body></html>
