(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/10-8.htm" title="Your hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet you do destroy me.">Job 10:8-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-22.htm" title="I cannot tell how ye came into my womb: for I neither gave you breath nor life, neither was it I that formed the members of every one of you;">2 Maccabees 7:22</a>.)<p>Others take it of the ball of the threads of destiny; but this is not a Hebrew conception. By inserting the word <span class= "ital">members, </span>the Authorised Version suggests a <span class= "ital">possible, </span>but not a probable, interpretation. The Hebrew language likes to use a pronoun before the word to which it refers has occurred (see Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm" title="When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.">Psalm 68:14</a>); and, in spite of the accents, we must refer <span class= "ital">all of them </span>to "days" (Authorised Version, "in continuance").<p>"Thine eyes beheld my embryo,<p>And in thy book were written<p>All the days, the days<p>Which were being formed,<p>When as yet there were none of them."<p>But a much more satisfactory sense is obtained by adopting one slight change and following Symmachus in the last line--<p>"The days which are all reckoned, and not one of them is wanting."<p>All the ancient versions make that which is written in God's book either the days of life, or men born in the course of these days, each coming into being according to the Divine will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/139.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect</span>; or, "my embryo." The Hebrew text has but the single word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, which probably means, "the still unformed embryonic mass" (Hengstenberg). <span class="cmt_word">And in thy book all my members were written</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all of them</span>; but the pronoun has no antecedent. Professor Cheyne and others suspect the passage to have suffered corruption. But the general meaning can scarcely have been very different from that assigned to the passage in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Which in continuance were fashioned</span>, when as yet there was none of them. Modern critics mostly translate "the days," or "my days," "were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "my life was planned out by God, and settled, before I began to be." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>139:7-16 We cannot see God, but he can see us. The psalmist did not desire to go from the Lord. Whither can I go? In the most distant corners of the world, in heaven, or in hell, I cannot go out of thy reach. No veil can hide us from God; not the thickest darkness. No disguise can save any person or action from being seen in the true light by him. Secret haunts of sin are as open before God as the most open villanies. On the other hand, the believer cannot be removed from the supporting, comforting presence of his Almighty Friend. Should the persecutor take his life, his soul will the sooner ascend to heaven. The grave cannot separate his body from the love of his Saviour, who will raise it a glorious body. No outward circumstances can separate him from his Lord. While in the path of duty, he may be happy in any situation, by the exercise of faith, hope, and prayer.</body></html>
