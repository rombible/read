The English sufficiently suggests the figure.<p><span class= "bld">In the lowest parts of the earth.</span>--This figurative allusion to the womb is intended no doubt to heighten the feeling of mystery attaching to birth. There may also be a covert allusion to the creation from dust as <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/40-1.htm" title="Great travail is created for every man, and an heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's womb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things.">Ecclesiasticus 40:1</a>, "From the day that they go out of their mother's womb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things." This allusion falls in with the view which meets us in other parts of the Old Testament, that the creation of Adam is repeated at every birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm" title="Behold, I am according to your wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.">Job 33:6</a>, and see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-13.htm" title="For you have possessed my reins: you have covered me in my mother's womb.">Psalm 139:13</a>).<p>Others, since the expression "lowest places of the earth" is used of the unseen world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-9.htm" title="But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.">Psalm 63:9</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-13.htm" title="For great is your mercy toward me: and you have delivered my soul from the lowest hell.">Psalm 86:13</a>), see here a confirmation of the view that the state before birth and after death are in this poem regarded as the dark void of night, with all the recesses of which, however, God is acquainted. (Comp. the expressions "Womb of Sheol," "Belly of hell," <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-2.htm" title="And said, I cried by reason of my affliction to the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and you heard my voice.">Jonah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/51-5.htm" title="From the depth of the belly of hell, from an unclean tongue, and from lying words.">Ecclesiasticus 51:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/139.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret.</span> The formation of the embryo in the womb seems to be intended.

It is perhaps only a variant for the "secretly" of the preceding clause. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>139:7-16 We cannot see God, but he can see us. The psalmist did not desire to go from the Lord. Whither can I go? In the most distant corners of the world, in heaven, or in hell, I cannot go out of thy reach. No veil can hide us from God; not the thickest darkness. No disguise can save any person or action from being seen in the true light by him. Secret haunts of sin are as open before God as the most open villanies. On the other hand, the believer cannot be removed from the supporting, comforting presence of his Almighty Friend. Should the persecutor take his life, his soul will the sooner ascend to heaven. The grave cannot separate his body from the love of his Saviour, who will raise it a glorious body. No outward circumstances can separate him from his Lord. While in the path of duty, he may be happy in any situation, by the exercise of faith, hope, and prayer.</body></html>
