The <span class= "ital">Urim </span>and <span class= "ital">Thummim </span>of the saints (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-8.htm" title="And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>), the promised attendants of Israel, have been, and are, the escort of all faithful souls in all ages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O send out thy light and thy truth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>, where, however, "mercy (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e1;&#x5d3;</span>) and truth" take the place of "light and truth"). Both words equally signify God's favour. Let them lead me. As the pillar of fire and of the cloud led the Israelites into the promised land, so let God's "light and truth" now lead David back to Jerusalem and God's "holy hill of Zion." <span class="cmt_word">Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles;</span> or, <span class="accented">thy dwelling-place.</span> In his exile it was David's most earnest desire to revisit the tabernacle which he had set up on Mount Zion, where God's presence dwelt, and prayer was most acceptably offered (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-2.htm">Psalm 42:2</a>). He had made his being brought back to it a test of the return of God's favour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25, 26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/43.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>43:6-11 The way to forget our miseries, is to remember the God of our mercies. David saw troubles coming from God's wrath, and that discouraged him. But if one trouble follow hard after another, if all seem to combine for our ruin, let us remember they are all appointed and overruled by the Lord. David regards the Divine favour as the fountain of all the good he looked for. In the Saviour's name let us hope and pray. One word from him will calm every storm, and turn midnight darkness into the light of noon, the bitterest complaints into joyful praises. Our believing expectation of mercy must quicken our prayers for it. At length, is faith came off conqueror, by encouraging him to trust in the name of the Lord, and to stay himself upon his God. He adds, And my God; this thought enabled him to triumph over all his griefs and fears. Let us never think that the God of our life, and the Rock of our salvation, has forgotten us, if we have made his mercy, truth, and power, our refuge. Thus the psalmist strove against his despondency: at last his faith and hope obtained the victory. Let us learn to check all unbelieving doubts and fears. Apply the promise first to ourselves, and then plead it to God.</body></html>
