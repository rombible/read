As this strophe begins (ver. 9), so it ends, with an imprecation. The psalmist calls on God to bring destruction upon the whole mass <span class="cmt_word">of</span> his enemies. Of the two readings in the original, the one adopted by our translators seems the best, "Let death come suddenly upon them." <span class="cmt_word">Let them go down quick</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">alive</span>) into hell. There is an allusion to the fate of Korah and his company (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30-33</a>), who "went down quick into the pit;" but probably the psalmist neither expected nor desired a literal fulfilment of his imprecation. The deaths of Ahithophel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>) and Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14, 15</a>), and of so many of Absalom's followers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-7.htm">2 Samuel 18:7, 8</a>), were quite a sufficient fulfilment. <span class="cmt_word">For wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</span> (comp. vers. 3, 9-11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/55.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>55:9-15 No wickedness so distresses the believer, as that which he witnesses in those who profess to be of the church of God. Let us not be surprised at the corruptions and disorders of the church on earth, but long to see the New Jerusalem. He complains of one that had been very industrious against him. God often destroys the enemies of the church by dividing them. And an interest divided against itself cannot long stand. The true Christian must expect trials from professed friends, from those with whom he has been united; this will be very painful; but by looking unto Jesus we shall be enabled to bear it. Christ was betrayed by a companion, a disciple, an apostle, who resembled Ahithophel in his crimes and doom. Both were speedily overtaken by Divine vengeance. And this prayer is a prophecy of the utter, the everlasting ruin, of all who oppose and rebel against the Messiah.</body></html>
