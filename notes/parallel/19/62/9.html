He encourages the faithful, and warns the wicked, by the declaration that men of every sort "are but vanity" - have no strength, no permanence - while power belongs only to God. Those who "oppress" and "rob" are, consequently, not to be feared - there is no strength in riches - God alone determines the issues of things. Unto him belongs mercy, or loving kindness - a quality which leads him not only to forgive men their transgressions, but to "reward" them, when, by his assisting grace, they have done good works. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie;</span> rather, <span class="accented">only vanity</span> - or, <span class="accented">nought but vanity</span> - <span class="accented">are men of low degree</span>; common men, as we call them - mere sons of Adam. This is too evident for dispute; but, in the view of the psalmist, this is not the worst. "Men of high degree" (<span class="accented">beney ish</span>) are no better - they are "a lie" - an unreality - a fading, false illusion. <span class="cmt_word">To be laid in the balance</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the balance, they go up</span> (Hupfeld, Ewald Hitzig, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">They are altogether lighter than vanity;</span> or, <span class="accented">altogether made out of vanity</span> (Kay); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. there is no substance, no solidity, in them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/62.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>62:8-12 Those who have found the comfort of the ways of God themselves, will invite others into those ways; we shall never have the less for others sharing with us. the good counsel given is, to trust wholly in God. We must so trust in him at all times, as not at any time to put that trust in ourselves, or in any creature, which is to be put in him only. Trust in him to guide us when in doubt, to protect us when in danger, to supply us when in want, to strengthen us for every good word and work. We must lay out wants and our wishes before him, and then patiently submit our wills to his: this is pouring out our hearts. God is a refuge for all, even for as many as will take shelter in him. The psalmist warns against trusting in men. The multitude, those of low degree, are changeable as the wind. The rich and noble seem to have much in their power, and lavish promises; but those that depend on them, are disappointed. Weighed in the balance of Scripture, all that man can do to make us happy is lighter than vanity itself. It is hard to have riches, and not to trust in them if they increase, though by lawful and honest means; but we must take heed, lest we set our affections unduly upon them. A smiling world is the most likely to draw the heart from God, on whom alone it should be set. The consistent believer receives all from God as a trust; and he seeks to use it to his glory, as a steward who must render an account. God hath spoken as it were once for all, that power belongs to him alone. He can punish and destroy. Mercy also belongs to him; and his recompensing the imperfect services of those that believe in him, blotting out their transgressions for the Redeemer's sake, is a proof of abundant mercy, and encourages us to trust in him. Let us trust in his mercy and grace, and abound in his work, expecting mercies from him alone.</body></html>
