The contrast of the present with former times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-5.htm" title="I remember the days of old; I meditate on all your works; I muse on the work of your hands.">Psalm 143:5</a>) with the recollection of God's dealings then, joined to thoughtful contemplation of the reality of His power as displayed in His works, makes the psalmist's anguish the more intense, his longing the more consuming, his supplication the more urgent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/143.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear me speedily, O Lord</span>. Here the direct supplication of ver. 1 is taken up, and pressed. "Hear me, O Lord; and not only hear me, but that speedily.

He pleads the wretchedness of his case, if God withdrew from him. But the night of distress and discouragement shall end in a morning of consolation and praise. He prays that he might be enlightened with the knowledge of God's will; and this is the first work of the Spirit. A good man does not ask the way in which is the most pleasant walking, but what is the right way. Not only show me what thy will is, but teach me how to do it. Those who have the Lord for their God, have his Spirit for their Guide; they are led by the Spirit. He prays that he might be enlivened to do God's will. But we should especially seek the destruction of our sins, our worst enemies, that we may be devotedly God's servants.</body></html>
