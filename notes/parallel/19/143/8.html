His utter trust in God gives him a claim to be beard and helped. <span class="cmt_word">Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. illumine me, so that I may perceive the course which I ought to follow (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>, "Make thy way straight before my face"). <span class="cmt_word">For I lift up my soul unto thee</span>. Again, a sort of claim seems to be urged, as in clause 2. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/143.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>143:7-12 David prays that God would be well pleased with him, and let him know that he was so. He pleads the wretchedness of his case, if God withdrew from him. But the night of distress and discouragement shall end in a morning of consolation and praise. He prays that he might be enlightened with the knowledge of God's will; and this is the first work of the Spirit. A good man does not ask the way in which is the most pleasant walking, but what is the right way. Not only show me what thy will is, but teach me how to do it. Those who have the Lord for their God, have his Spirit for their Guide; they are led by the Spirit. He prays that he might be enlivened to do God's will. But we should especially seek the destruction of our sins, our worst enemies, that we may be devotedly God's servants.</body></html>
