These verses really sum up the apparent paradox of the Book of Job, as also the expressions recall that Book.

Man, in his desire to have his character vindicated before man, appeals to the just Judge, but instantly falls back with a guilty sense that before that tribunal none can stand:<p>"For merit lives from man to man,<p>And not from man, O Lord, to Thee.<p><span class= "bld">Shall . . . be justified.--</span>This follows the LXX.

The psalmist, having touched the point of abstract justice, shrinks from pressing it. He knows that he is not "righteous before God," and that his life and conduct "cannot endure the severity of God's judgment" (Art. XII.). He therefore "deprecates a strictly retributive treatment" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">For in thy sight shall no man living be justified</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm">Job 4:17-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-4.htm">Job 25:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/143.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>143:1-6 We have no righteousness of our own to plead, therefore must plead God's righteousness, and the word of promise which he has freely given us, and caused us to hope in. David, before he prays for the removal of his trouble, prays for the pardon of his sin, and depends upon mercy alone for it. He bemoans the weight upon his mind from outward troubles. But he looks back, and remembers God's former appearance for his afflicted people, and for him in particular. He looks round, and notices the works of God. The more we consider the power of God, the less we shall fear the face or force of man. He looks up with earnest desires towards God and his favour. This is the best course we can take, when our spirits are overwhelmed. The believer will not forget, that in his best actions he is a sinner. Meditation and prayer will recover us from distresses; and then the mourning soul strives to return to the Lord as the infant stretches out its hands to the indulgent mother, and thirsts for his consolations as the parched ground for refreshing rain.</body></html>
