As to the choice among the various explanations that have been given of it, we must remark that the one which takes "fear" in a good sense ("Then were they in great fright where there was no fear of God") is excluded by the fact that the same word is employed in both clauses; and, as elsewhere <span class= "ital">p?chad </span>is used of a "cause of terror," we may render, <span class= "ital">There were they in great fear, where there was no cause for fear.</span><p>Apparently, from the immediate context, this statement is made not of the enemies of Israel, but of Israel itself, and was so constantly applicable to a people supposed to be living under the immediate protection of God, and yet liable to sudden panics, that we need not try to recover the precise event referred to.<p><span class= "bld">Of him that encampeth against thee.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of thy besiegers. </span>The bones of the beleaguering host lie bleaching on the sand. But the text seems to have suffered. The LXX. and Vulg. have "the bones of them that please men," and a comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/14-5.htm" title="There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.">Psalm 14:5-6</a> shows such a similarity of <span class= "ital">letters, </span>with difference of <span class= "ital">meaning, </span>that both texts look like different attempts to restore some faded MS. Many attempts have been made to restore the original, but none eminently satisfactory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/53.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were they in great fear, where no fear was</span>. So long a phrase as "where no fear was" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;</span>) can scarcely have "fallen out," and must have been added intentionally to mark that, on the occasion in connection with which the revision was made, there had been no ground at all for the panic. <span class="cmt_word">For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee</span>. This clause takes the place of the following in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>.: "For God is in the generation of the righteous" - a very considerable change, which must certainly have been intentional. On the second occasion whereto the psalm was made applicable, there must have been a very great catastrophe - some vast slaughter of an enemy who had been at open war with Israel. Sennacherib is suggested (Canon Cook). Thou hast put them to shams, because God hath despised them. The clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>. which this replaces runs as follows: "Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his Refuge." Here again, both the phrases used, and the whole tenor of the thought in either case, are different. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/53.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>53:1-6 The corruption of man by nature. - This psalm is almost the same as the 14th. The scope of it is to convince us of our sins. God, by the psalmist, here shows us how bad we are, and proves this by his own certain knowledge. He speaks terror to persecutors, the worst of sinners. He speaks encouragement to God's persecuted people. How comes it that men are so bad? Because there is no fear of God before their eyes. Men's bad practices flow from their bad principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, because in thoughts, they deny him. See the folly of sin; he is a fool, in the account of God, whose judgment we are sure is right, that harbours such corrupt thoughts. And see the fruit of sin; to what it brings men, when their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. See also the faith of the saints, and their hope and power as to the cure of this great evil. There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. God will save his church from its enemies. He will save all believers from their own sins, that they may not be led captive by them, which will be everlasting joy to them. From this work the Redeemer had his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins, Mt 1:21.</body></html>
