"Tabernacles," or "tents," is continually used by the sacred writers as a synonym for "dwellings." The use of the expression here by no means implies that the Israelites of the time were actually living in tents. <span class="cmt_word">The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly</span> (scrap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6, 12</a>).

God is sometimes the strength of his people, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, though they want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him. Such were the triumphs of the Son of David, in the assurance that the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.</body></html>
