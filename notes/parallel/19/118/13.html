The psalmist recalls the past, and throws himself, as it were, once more into the midst of the struggle. Thou - mine enemy, Babylon - didst make s desperate onset upon me, fully intending my destruction. <span class="cmt_word">But the Lord helped me</span>. Frustrated thy purpose - preserved the life, the national life, which thou aimedst at destroying, and so did most effectually "help me." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/118.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>118:1-18 The account the psalmist here gives of his troubles is very applicable to Christ: many hated him without a cause; nay, the Lord himself chastened him sorely, bruised him, and put him to grief, that by his stripes we might be healed. God is sometimes the strength of his people, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, though they want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him. Such were the triumphs of the Son of David, in the assurance that the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.</body></html>
