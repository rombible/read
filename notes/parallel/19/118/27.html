Figuratively the words would, of course, mean "the light of salvation and hope," as so frequently in the Psalms. It is also possible there may be allusion to the priestly benediction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-25.htm" title="The LORD make his face shine on you, and be gracious to you:">Numbers 6:25</a>), where the verb is the same.<p><span class= "bld">Bind the sacrifice . . .</span>--This cannot well be, "tie the victim to the horns of the altar," for the Hebrew is "as far as to," and no satisfactory explanation is possible of binding animals as far as the altar, unless we are to translate "bind and lead." But the Hebrew word rendered <span class= "ital">victim </span>might by derivation ("to go round") easily mean a <span class= "ital">circlet </span>or <span class= "ital">crown, </span>and by supplying the verb <span class= "ital">go </span>we get <span class= "ital">bind on a crown, go with garlands even to the horns of the altar. </span>The ancient versions, LXX., Vulg., Aquila, Symmachus, all point to this rendering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/118.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God is the Lord, which hath showed us light</span>. Having received the priestly benediction, the processionists resume their strain. They have entered within the courts; they are approaching the altar of sacrifice; they have brought their offering. "Jehovah," they say, "is God, and hath given us light" (see the Revised Version). That is, he has enlightened our spirits to see and acknowledge his mercies; or, perhaps, he has led us, as he did the people, by a pillar of fire in the wilderness; and now we stand before the altar with our offering - <span class="cmt_word">receive it at our hands, ye priests-and bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.</span> So shalt the act of thanksgiving be complete, and the solemn service ended. The fanciful exposition of Luther, lately revived by Professor Cheyne, will scarcely approve itself to critics generally. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/118.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>118:22,23, may refer to David's preferment; but principally to Christ. 1. His humiliation; he is the Stone which the builders refused: they would go on in their building without him. This proved the ruin of those who thus made light of him. Rejecters of Christ are rejected of God. 2. His exaltation; he is the chief Cornerstone in the foundation. He is the chief Top-stone, in whom the building is completed, who must, in all things, have the pre-eminence. Christ's name is Wonderful; and the redemption he wrought out is the most amazing of all God's wondrous works. We will rejoice and be glad in the Lord's day; not only that such a day is appointed, but in the occasion of it, Christ's becoming the Head. Sabbath days ought to be rejoicing days, then they are to us as the days of heaven. Let this Saviour be my Saviour, my Ruler. Let my soul prosper and be in health, in that peace and righteousness which his government brings. Let me have victory over the lusts that war against my soul; and let Divine grace subdue my heart. The duty which the Lord has made, brings light with it, true light. The duty this privilege calls for, is here set forth; the sacrifices we are to offer to God in gratitude for redeeming love, are ourselves; not to be slain upon the altar, but living sacrifices, to be bound to the altar; spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise, in which our hearts must be engaged. The psalmist praises God, and calls upon all about him to give thanks to God for the glad tidings of great joy to all people, that there is a Redeemer, even Christ the Lord. In him the covenant of grace is made sure and everlasting.</body></html>
