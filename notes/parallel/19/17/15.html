The satisfaction of worldly men is in their wealth and family honours, that of the poet in the sun of God's presence and the vision of His righteousness. (Comp. Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-7.htm" title="For the righteous LORD loves righteousness; his countenance does behold the upright.">Psalm 11:7</a>.)<p>Instead of "likeness," render <span class= "ital">image, </span>or <span class= "ital">appearance. </span>But what does the poet mean by the hope of seeking God when he wakes? Some think of rising to peace after a perplexing trouble; others of health after suffering; others of the sunlight of the Divine grace breaking on the soul. But the literal reference to night in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm" title="You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.">Psalm 17:3</a> seems to ask for the same reference here. Instead of waking to a worldling's hope of a day of feasting and pleasure, the psalmist wakes to the higher and nobler thought that God--who in sleep (so like death, when nothing is visible), has been, as it were, absent--is now again, when he sees once more (LXX.), found at his right hand (comp. end of Psalms 16), a conscious presence to him, assuring him of justice and protection. But as in Psalms 16, so here, we feel that in spite of his subjection to the common notions about death the psalmist may have felt the stirrings of a better hope. Such "cries from the dark," even if they do not prove the possession of a belief in immortality, show how the human heart was already groping its way, however blindly, towards it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "As for me, I do not envy the wicked man's prosperity. I set against it the blessedness of which I am quite sure. I in my righteousness shall behold the face of God, have the light of his countenance shine upon me, and thus be raised to a condition of perfect happiness." <span class="cmt_word">Moreover, I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness</span>. David had already spoken of death as a "sleep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>). Now he speaks of "awaking." What awaking can this be but an awaking from the sleep of death? When he so awakes, he says, he will he "satisfied with God's <span class="accented">likeness."</span> The word used is the same as that employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>, of the manifestation of the Divine glory to Moses - viz. <span class="accented">temunah.</span> David therefore expects to see, on awaking, a similar manifestation, he will have the enjoyment of the "beatific vision," if not in the Christian sense, at any rate in a true and real sense, and one that will wholly "satisfy" him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:8-15 Being compassed with enemies, David prays to God to keep him in safety. This prayer is a prediction that Christ would be preserved, through all the hardships and difficulties of his humiliation, to the glories and joys of his exalted state, and is a pattern to Christians to commit the keeping of their souls to God, trusting him to preserve them to his heavenly kingdom. Those are our worst enemies, that are enemies to our souls. They are God's sword, which cannot move without him, and which he will sheathe when he has done his work with it. They are his hand, by which he chastises his people. There is no fleeing from God's hand, but by fleeing to it. It is very comfortable, when we are in fear of the power of man, to see it dependent upon, and in subjection to the power of God. Most men look on the things of this world as the best things; and they look no further, nor show any care to provide for another life. The things of this world are called treasures, they are so accounted; but to the soul, and when compared with eternal blessings, they are trash. The most afflicted Christian need not envy the most prosperous men of the world, who have their portion in this life. Clothed with Christ's righteousness, having through his grace a good heart and a good life, may we by faith behold God's face, and set him always before us. When we awake every morning, may we be satisfied with his likeness set before us in his word, and with his likeness stamped upon us by his renewing grace. Happiness in the other world is prepared only for those that are justified and sanctified: they shall be put in possession of it when the soul awakes, at death, out of its slumber in the body, and when the body awakes, at the resurrection, out of its slumber in the grave. There is no satisfaction for a soul but in God, and in his good will towards us, and his good work in us; yet that satisfaction will not be perfect till we come to heaven.</body></html>
