The night is the time when men can least escape those searching, testing thoughts which God's providence then especially sends, to "try the very heart and reins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast tried me., and shalt find nothing;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and findest nothing.</span> The process was one begun in the past, and continuing on in the present. God was ever searching David and trying him; but "found nothing," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no alloy, no base rectal, no serious flaw in his character; not that he was sinless, but that he 'was sincere and earnest - a true worshipper of God, not a hypocrite. <span class="cmt_word">I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</span> "If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>). David's resolution to "keep the door of his lips" would have a chastening influence over both his thoughts and acts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 This psalm is a prayer. Feigned prayers are fruitless; but if our hearts lead our prayers, God will meet them with his favour. The psalmist had been used to pray, so that it was not his distress and danger that now first brought him to his duty. And he was encouraged by his faith to expect God would notice his prayers. Constant resolution and watchfulness against sins of the tongue, will be a good evidence of our integrity. Aware of man's propensity to wicked works, and of his own peculiar temptations, David had made God's word his preservative from the paths of Satan, which lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very comfortable in the reflection, when we are in trouble. Those that are, through grace, going in God's paths, should pray that their goings may be held up in those paths. David prays, Lord, still hold me up. Those who would proceed and persevere in the ways of God, must, by faith prayer, get daily fresh supplies of grace and strength from him. Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, distinguishing favours, not common mercies, but be gracious to me; do as thou usest to do to those who love thy name.</body></html>
