The "daughter of Zion" is, of course, Jerusalem. Compare "daughter of Babylon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-42.htm">Jeremiah 50:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>), "daughter of the Chaldeans" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a>), "daughter of Edom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21, 22</a>), "daughter of Gallim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>). Hengstenberg is probably right in understanding "in the gates" as "<span class="accented">within</span> the gates," since, as he observes, "God's praise is not to be celebrated <span class="accented">in</span> the gates, amid the throng of worldly business, but in the temple." The references in the ' Speaker's Commentary' do not bear out the statement there made, that "public mournings and public thanksgivings were proclaimed in the gates." <span class="cmt_word">I will rejoice in thy salvation</span>; or, <span class="accented">that I may rejoice</span> (Kay). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-20 Those who believe that God is greatly to be praised, not only desire to praise him better themselves, but desire that others may join with them. There is a day coming, when it will appear that he has not forgotten the cry of the humble; neither the cry of their blood, or the cry of their prayers. We are never brought so low, so near to death, but God can raise us up. If he has saved us from spiritual and eternal death, we may thence hope, that in all our distresses he will be a very present help to us. The overruling providence of God frequently so orders it, that persecutors and oppressors are brought to ruin by the projects they formed to destroy the people of God. Drunkards kill themselves; prodigals beggar themselves; the contentious bring mischief upon themselves: thus men's sins may be read in their punishment, and it becomes plain to all, that the destruction of sinners is of themselves. All wickedness came originally with the wicked one from hell; and those who continue in sin, must go to that place of torment. The true state, both of nations and of individuals, may be correctly estimated by this one rule, whether in their doings they remember or forget God. David encourages the people of God to wait for his salvation, though it should be long deferred. God will make it appear that he never did forget them: it is not possible he should. Strange that man, dust in his and about him, should yet need some sharp affliction, some severe visitation from God, to bring him to the knowledge of himself, and make him feel who and what he is.</body></html>
