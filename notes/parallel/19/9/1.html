The thanks are special for a great deliverance - a deliverance from some heathen enemy (vers. 5, 15), who has been signally defeated and almost exterminated (vers. 5, 6). It has been conjectured that the subjugation of Ammon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26-31</a>) is the occasion referred to ('Speaker's Commentary'); but the expectation of further attack (vers. 17-20) scarcely suits this period, when David's wars were well-nigh over. Perhaps the earlier victory over Ammon and Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-14</a>), which was followed by the renewed invasion of the same nations in conjunction with "the Syrians beyond the river" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a>), is more likely to have drawn forth the composition. I will show forth all thy marvellous works; rather, I <span class="accented">will tell forth</span>, or I <span class="accented">will recount all thy wondrous deeds.</span> Not necessarily miracles, but any strange and unexpected deliverances, such as the recent one (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-10 If we would praise God acceptably, we must praise him in sincerity, with our whole heart. When we give thanks for some one particular mercy, we should remember former mercies. Our joy must not be in the gift, so much as in the Giver. The triumphs of the Redeemer ought to be the triumphs of the redeemed. The almighty power of God is that which the strongest and stoutest of his enemies are no way able to stand before. We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, and that with him there is no unrighteousness. His people may, by faith, flee to him as their Refuge, and may depend on his power and promise for their safety, so that no real hurt shall be done to them. Those who know him to be a God of truth and faithfulness, will rejoice in his word of promise, and rest upon that. Those who know him to be an everlasting Father, will trust him with their souls as their main care, and trust in him at all times, even to the end; and by constant care seek to approve themselves to him in the whole course of their lives. Who is there that would not seek him, who never hath forsaken those that seek Him?</body></html>
