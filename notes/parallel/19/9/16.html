The two clauses are grammatically distinct, though no doubt closely connected in their meaning. God makes himself known - manifests his character, by the judgments which he executes, shows himself just, perhaps severe, certainly One who "will not at all acquit the wicked" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands</span>. Some translate, "he snareth the wicked," or, "by snaring the wicked" - the special way in which God manifests himself (see Kay, p. 31; 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 190). Higgaion. This word is found in three other places only, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-61.htm">Lamentations 3:61</a>. In the first it is translated "meditation," and has clearly that meaning; in the second it is supposed to mean "a gentle strain:" in the third it seems best rendered by "musing" or "reflection." Here it stands by itself, as a sort of rubrical direction, like the following word, "Selah." Some suppose it a direction to the choir to play a gentle strain of instrumental music as an interlude; others regard it as enjoining upon the congregation a space of quiet "meditation" (see Hengstenberg, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>; and compare Professor Alexander's work, 'The Psalms translated and explained,' p. 45). <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span> (see the comment on Psalm 3:2). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:11-20 Those who believe that God is greatly to be praised, not only desire to praise him better themselves, but desire that others may join with them. There is a day coming, when it will appear that he has not forgotten the cry of the humble; neither the cry of their blood, or the cry of their prayers. We are never brought so low, so near to death, but God can raise us up. If he has saved us from spiritual and eternal death, we may thence hope, that in all our distresses he will be a very present help to us. The overruling providence of God frequently so orders it, that persecutors and oppressors are brought to ruin by the projects they formed to destroy the people of God. Drunkards kill themselves; prodigals beggar themselves; the contentious bring mischief upon themselves: thus men's sins may be read in their punishment, and it becomes plain to all, that the destruction of sinners is of themselves. All wickedness came originally with the wicked one from hell; and those who continue in sin, must go to that place of torment. The true state, both of nations and of individuals, may be correctly estimated by this one rule, whether in their doings they remember or forget God. David encourages the people of God to wait for his salvation, though it should be long deferred. God will make it appear that he never did forget them: it is not possible he should. Strange that man, dust in his and about him, should yet need some sharp affliction, some severe visitation from God, to bring him to the knowledge of himself, and make him feel who and what he is.</body></html>
