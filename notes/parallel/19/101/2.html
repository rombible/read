hence some here see a reference to music, or song. But the Authorised Version is probably right, since the analogy of such words as "provident," "circumspect," shows how the idea of caution and then wisdom arises from that of looking. The English idiom, "look to your ways," illustrates the Hebrew here.<p><span class= "bld">O when wilt thou come unto me</span>?--This clause is so awkward, however translated, that some critics go the length of pronouncing it spurious. In the Old Testament, with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.">Exodus 20:24</a>, the coming of God to a person is associated with the idea of punishment or inquisition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm" title="You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.">Psalm 17:3</a>); and to see a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-9.htm" title="And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?">2Samuel 6:9</a> (" How shall the ark of the Lord come to me?") seems far-fetched. It is better, therefore, to take the verb as the third person feminine instead of second masculine, with "perfect way" as its subject. The only difficulty in the way of this rendering is the interrogative; but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-22.htm" title="Listen to your father that begat you, and despise not your mother when she is old.">Proverbs 23:22</a>, it becomes a simple adverb of time, we may treat it so here: "I will give heed to a guileless way when it comes to me," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>whenever a course of action arises, presenting an alternative of a <span class= "ital">right </span>and <span class= "ital">wrong, </span>or a <span class= "ital">better </span>and <span class= "ital">worse, </span>I will choose the <span class= "ital">better.</span><p><span class= "bld">I will walk within my house.</span>--This vow of an <span class= "ital">Eastern </span>monarch should be read with the thought of the palace of a caliph at Bagdad, or a sultan at Constantinople, before the mind. But it is a reflection of universal application, that piety should begin at home, and religion show itself in the household as much as at church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/101.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-22.htm">Psalm 18:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a>). The psalmist aspires after "perfectness." Then feeling his inability to walk in the perfect way by his own strength, he cries to God for aid - <span class="cmt_word">O when wilt thou come unto me?</span> "Unless," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "thou come unto me, I cannot keep one of these resolutions. O Lord, come quickly." <span class="cmt_word">I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</span> It is not only the "way," or conduct, that requires to be "perfect," but the "heart" also, or the motives from which the conduct springs. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/101.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>101:1-8 David's vow and profession of godliness. - In this psalm we have David declaring how he intended to regulate his household, and to govern his kingdom, that he might stop wickedness, and encourage godliness. It is also applicable to private families, and is the householder's psalm. It teaches all that have any power, whether more or less, to use it so as to be a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well. The chosen subject of the psalm is God's mercy and judgment. The Lord's providences concerning his people are commonly mixed; mercy and judgment. God has set the one over against the other, both to do good, like showers and sunshine. When, in his providence, he exercises us with the mixture of mercy and judgment, we must make suitable acknowledgments to him for both. Family mercies and family afflictions are both calls to family religion. Those who are in public stations are not thereby excused from care in governing their families; they are the more concerned to set a good example of ruling their own houses well. Whenever a man has a house of his own, let him seek to have God to dwell with him; and those may expect his presence, who walk with a perfect heart, in a perfect way. David resolves to practise no evil himself. He further resolves not to keep bad servants, nor to employ those about him that are wicked. He will not admit them into his family, lest they spread the infection of sin. A froward heart, one that delights to be cross and perverse, is not fit for society, the bond of which is Christian love. Nor will he countenance slanderers, those who take pleasure in wounding their neighbour's reputation. Also, God resists the proud, and false, deceitful people, who scruple not to tell lies, or commit frauds. Let every one be zealous and diligent to reform his own heart and ways, and to do this early; ever mindful of that future, most awful morning, when the King of righteousness shall cut off all wicked doers from the heavenly Jerusalem.</body></html>
