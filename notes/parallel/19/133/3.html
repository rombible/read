But the sentence is constructed in exactly the same form as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-2.htm" title="It is like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;">Psalm 133:2</a>, and the <span class= "ital">dew </span>on Mount Zion must be as clearly the same dew as that on Mount Hermon, as the oil running down to the beard was the same as that poured on the head. Nor may we take "the mountains of Zion "in a general way for the mountains of the country lying round Hermon like spurs, as Van de Velde does in the passage from his <span class= "ital">Travels, </span>quoted by Delitzsch. Mount Zion itself is intended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm" title="I will lift up my eyes to the hills, from where comes my help.">Psalm 121:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm" title="As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.">Psalm 125:2</a>, for this plural) as the last clause," there Jehovah commanded the blessing," clearly shows. Delitzsch says on the passage, "This feature of the picture is taken from the natural reality, for an abundant dew, when warm days have preceded, might very well be diverted to Jerusalem by the operation of the cold current of air, sweeping down from the north over Hermon. We know, indeed, of our own experience how far a cold air coming from the Alps is perceptible and produces its effects." But setting aside the amount of scientific observation required for such a perception of fact, would any one speak of the dew of Mont Blanc descending on the Jura?<p>We must evidently take "the dew of Hermon" as a poetical synonym for "choice dew." No doubt the height of Hermon, and the fact of its being so conspicuous, determined the expression. This choice dew, from its freshness, abundance, and its connection with life and growth, is a symbol, as the sacred oil also is, of the covenant blessing in its <span class= "ital">nature. </span>The descent of the moisture offered itself, as the flowing down of the oil did, as an emblem of the <span class= "ital">operation </span>of the blessing". But the conclusion of the simile is only implied. No doubt the poet intended to write, "As the oil poured on Aaron's head flowed down to his beard, and as the dew of Hermon flowed down on Mount Zion, so the covenant blessing descended on Jehovah's people;" but at the mention of Mount Zion he breaks off the simile, to make the statement, "for there Jehovah," &c. Hebrew poetry did not greatly favour the simile, and often confuses it with metaphor. (See Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-9.htm" title="Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.">Psalm 58:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-12.htm" title="My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: you, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.">Song of Solomon 8:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/133.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion</span>. The interpolation of the words, "and as the dew," is quite unwarrantable, and spoils the sense. It substitutes duality for unity, and destroys the parity of the two illustrations. Translate, "As the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion." The psalmist sees the moisture which fertilizes the Holy Land, and makes it the fertile land that it is, all given forth from Hermon, the one <span class="accented">great</span> mountain at its head. As Dr. Kay well observes, "Physically, Hermon was to Canaan what Aaron was ceremonially to Israel - its head and crown, from which the fertilizing stores of heaven descended over the land. For not only does the one great river of Palestine, the Jordan, issue from the roots of Hermon, but the giant mountain is constantly gathering and sending off clouds, which float down even to Southern Zion." <span class="cmt_word">For there</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in Zion) <span class="cmt_word">the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forevermore.</span> The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-21.htm">Leviticus 25:21</a>, and perhaps to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-8.htm">Deuteronomy 28:8</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/133.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>133:1-3 The excellency of brotherly love. - We cannot say too much, it were well if enough could be said, to persuade people to live together in peace. It is good for us, for our honour and comfort; and brings constant delight to those who live in unity. The pleasantness of this is likened to the holy anointing oil. This is the fruit of the Spirit, the proof of our union with Christ, and adorns his gospel. It is profitable as well as pleasing; it brings blessings numerous as the drops of dew. It cools the scorching heat of men's passions, as the dews cool the air and refresh the earth. It moistens the heart, and makes it fit to receive the good seed of the word, and to make it fruitful. See the proof of the excellency of brotherly love: where brethren dwell together in unity, the Lord commands the blessing. God commands the blessing; man can but beg a blessing. Believers that live in love and peace, shall have the God of love and peace with them now, and they shall shortly be with him for ever, in the world of endless love and peace. May all who love the Lord forbear and forgive one another, as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven them.</body></html>
