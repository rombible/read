(See Note.) Literally, <span class= "ital">Like the oil, the good oil, on the head descending upon the beard, Aaron's beard, which </span>(<span class= "ital">was</span>)<span class= "ital"> descending to the mouth of his robes. </span>Oil meets us as the standing symbol of joy and festivity. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>, Note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm" title="To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.">Isaiah 61:3</a>.) It is also brought closely into connection with <span class= "ital">love </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-3.htm" title="Because of the smell of your good ointments your name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love you.">Song of Solomon 1:3</a>). But while this association, as also the pleasure derived from the fragrance of the oil, would be present here as always in the truly Oriental image, its elaboration in this passage points to a further purpose. It is the holy oil, that whose composition is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-22.htm" title="Moreover the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Exodus 30:22-23</a>, that the poet alludes to. This, while the garments of all the priests were <span class= "ital">sprinkled </span>with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-21.htm" title="And you shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Exodus 29:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-30.htm" title="And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Leviticus 8:30</a>), was <span class= "ital">poured </span>on the head of Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-7.htm" title="Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.">Exodus 29:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm" title="And he poured of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10</a>), so that the description of the psalm, unpleasing as it is to Western ideas, of the saturation, not only of his head, but of face and beard, was actually true. It would run down his neck to the <span class= "ital">collar </span>of the priestly robe. That this is the meaning of "mouth" here is plain from the actual description of the sacerdotal garments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31-32</a>): "And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue. And there shall be a <span class= "ital">mouth </span>in the top of it, in the midst thereof: and it shall have a binding of woven work round about the <span class= "ital">mouth </span>of it, as it were the <span class= "ital">mouth </span>of a habergeon, that it be not rent." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-23.htm" title="And there was an hole in the middle of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.">Exodus 39:23</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm" title="By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it binds me about as the collar of my coat.">Job 30:18</a>, where Authorised Version has "collar.") To the ideas of "joy" and "fragrance," therefore, must also be added that of "consecration." But the point of the comparison does not lie even here; nor is it in the <span class= "ital">freshness </span>of the dew, in the next verse, or its <span class= "ital">abundance, </span>though dew suggests both of these (see Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm" title="Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.">Psalm 110:3</a>), but in the word three times repeated--<span class= "ital">descending. </span>Our version unfortunately obscures this point, by rendering this recurrent participle each time by a different word, missing, at the same time, the marked peculiarity of the rhythm of these psalms. The oil descends from Aaron's head over his face and beard; the dew of Hermon descends on Zion--low in actual measurement, but exalted by the Divine favour above the loftiest hills. It is not <span class= "ital">unity, </span>then, in itself which is the subject of the poem, but the unity of the <span class= "ital">covenant </span>under which all blessings <span class= "ital">flowed down </span>from above, rested on Mount Zion, and took outward shape and form there in the political and religious constitution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/133.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is like the precious ointment upon the head</span>. The anointing oil of the sanctuary was an ointment composed of many "precious" ingredients, as myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, and cassia, besides oil olive, which was its basis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23, 24</a>). Not only Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>), but all later high priests, were anointed with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-30.htm">Exodus 30:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard</span>. This would be the natural result of a copious "pouring" of the oil upon the top of the head. Though not mentioned historically in Leviticus, it presents itself to the eye of the poet, on whose mental vision the whole scene rises. <span class="cmt_word">That went down to the skirts of his garments.</span> Streamed even to the lower fringe of his long vesture (Kay). The high priest at his consecration was a type and symbol of unity. He bore on his breastplate the names of the twelve tribes, so that the holy oil, typical of the grace of God, when it was poured upon him, flowed down on all the tribes, diffusing everywhere an odor of fragrance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/133.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>133:1-3 The excellency of brotherly love. - We cannot say too much, it were well if enough could be said, to persuade people to live together in peace. It is good for us, for our honour and comfort; and brings constant delight to those who live in unity. The pleasantness of this is likened to the holy anointing oil. This is the fruit of the Spirit, the proof of our union with Christ, and adorns his gospel. It is profitable as well as pleasing; it brings blessings numerous as the drops of dew. It cools the scorching heat of men's passions, as the dews cool the air and refresh the earth. It moistens the heart, and makes it fit to receive the good seed of the word, and to make it fruitful. See the proof of the excellency of brotherly love: where brethren dwell together in unity, the Lord commands the blessing. God commands the blessing; man can but beg a blessing. Believers that live in love and peace, shall have the God of love and peace with them now, and they shall shortly be with him for ever, in the world of endless love and peace. May all who love the Lord forbear and forgive one another, as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven them.</body></html>
