(See, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-3.htm" title="Yes, let none that wait on you be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.">Psalm 25:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-30.htm" title="And Mephibosheth said to the king, Yes, let him take all, for as much as my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house.">2Samuel 19:30</a>.) The common idiom, <span class= "ital">gam shenayim, "</span>all two" (i.e., both), exactly like the French <span class= "ital">tous deux, </span>and the German <span class= "ital">alle beide, </span>decides this. Many commentators, rendering <span class= "ital">also together, </span>see an emphasis on the gathering for the yearly feasts: "How good and pleasant for those who are by race and religion brothers to unite for a sacred purpose" The allusion may be there, but the conjecture and purpose of the psalm, and not the form of the expression, suggest it. To a Hebrew, political and religious sentiment were always combined; and Jerusalem was the centre towards which their thoughts and eyes always turned. The translation of the LXX., "to the same place," though not exactly rendering the Hebrew, perhaps brings out the thought, for the poet was plainly thinking of "unity at Zion." This verse was quoted by the Roman legate at the meeting of Anselm and William II. at Windsor, Whitsunday, 1095. It was read at the reception of a new member into the brotherhood of the Knights Templars, and is by St. Augustine quoted as the Divine authority for monastic life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/133.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity</span>! The unity described appears to be existent, and to present itself to the psalmist's vision. Hence the opening, "Behold!" All may see it, and see how blessed and pleasant a thing it is. "Brethren" is used in the wide sense of descendants of a common ancestor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-8.htm">Genesis 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-11.htm">Exodus 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-26.htm">Acts 7:26</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/133.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>133:1-3 The excellency of brotherly love. - We cannot say too much, it were well if enough could be said, to persuade people to live together in peace. It is good for us, for our honour and comfort; and brings constant delight to those who live in unity. The pleasantness of this is likened to the holy anointing oil. This is the fruit of the Spirit, the proof of our union with Christ, and adorns his gospel. It is profitable as well as pleasing; it brings blessings numerous as the drops of dew. It cools the scorching heat of men's passions, as the dews cool the air and refresh the earth. It moistens the heart, and makes it fit to receive the good seed of the word, and to make it fruitful. See the proof of the excellency of brotherly love: where brethren dwell together in unity, the Lord commands the blessing. God commands the blessing; man can but beg a blessing. Believers that live in love and peace, shall have the God of love and peace with them now, and they shall shortly be with him for ever, in the world of endless love and peace. May all who love the Lord forbear and forgive one another, as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven them.</body></html>
