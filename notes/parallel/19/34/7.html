From comparison with other passages it may be (1) any commissioned agent of God, as a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm" title="Then spoke Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message to the people, saying, I am with you, said the LORD.">Haggai 1:13</a>). (2) One of the celestial court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.">Genesis 22:11</a>). (3) Any manifestation of the Divine presence, as the flame in the bush (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.">Exodus 3:2</a>), the winds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/35-5.htm" title="Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.">Psalm 35:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4</a>). (4) Jehovah Himself, as in the phrase "the angel of his presence" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm" title="In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.">Isaiah 63:9</a>). It may very well be, therefore, that the psalmist uses it here in a general sense for the Divine manifestation of protection. We thus avoid the difficulty in the image of <span class= "ital">one </span>angel encamping round the sufferer, which other commentators try to avoid by supposing <span class= "ital">angel </span>to mean either a <span class= "ital">troop </span>of angels, or <span class= "ital">captain </span>or <span class= "ital">chief </span>of an angelic army. But for this difficulty, we should connect the psalmist's words immediately with the well-known incident in Jacob's life at Mahanaim, or with the story of Elisha and "the horses and chariots of fire" round about him. We certainly must not let go the beautiful thought that round God's elect--<p>"The spangled hosts keep watch in squadrons bright."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel of the Lord eneampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them</span>. According to some commentators (Rosenmuller, 'Four Friends,' and others), the expression, "angel of the Lord," is here used as a collective, and means the angels generally. With this certainly agrees the statement that the angel "encampeth <span class="accented">round about</span> them that fear him;" and the illustration from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-14.htm">2 Kings 6:14-18</a> is thus exactly apposite. But others deny that "the angel of the Lord" has ever a collective sense, and think a single personality must necessarily* be intended, which they regard as identical with "the captain of the Lord's host," who appeared to Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14, 15</a>), and "the angel of the Lord's presence" spoken of by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>); so Kay, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Professor Alexander, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.' When pressed to say how this one angel can "encamp round" a number of persons, they reply that, of course, he has his subordinates with him - a "spangled host," that "keep watch in squadrons bright;" and that he is said to do what they do, which is no doubt quite in accordance with ordinary modes of speech. Thus, however, the two expositions become nearly identical, since, according to both, it is the angelic host which "encamps around" the faithful. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-10 If we hope to spend eternity in praising God, it is fit that we should spend much of our time here in this work. He never said to any one, Seek ye me in vain. David's prayers helped to silence his fears; many besides him have looked unto the Lord by faith and prayer, and it has wonderfully revived and comforted them. When we look to the world, we are perplexed, and at a loss. But on looking to Christ depends our whole salvation, and all things needful thereunto do so also. This poor man, whom no man looked upon with any respect, or looked after with any concern, was yet welcome to the throne of grace; the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The holy angels minister to the saints, and stand for them against the powers of darkness. All the glory be to the Lord of the angels. By taste and sight we both make discoveries, and have enjoyment; Taste and see God's goodness; take notice of it, and take the comfort of it. He makes all truly blessed that trust in him. As to the things of the other world, they shall have grace sufficient for the support of spiritual life. And as to this life, they shall have what is necessary from the hand of God. Paul had all, and abounded, because he was content, Php 4:11-18. Those who trust to themselves, and think their own efforts sufficient for them, shall want; but they shall be fed who trust in the Lord. Those shall not want, who with quietness work, and mind their own business.</body></html>
