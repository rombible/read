If the statement in the title may be relied upon, David's fortunes were now at the lowest ebb. He had fled from the court of Saul on finding that Saul was determined to put him to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-31.htm">1 Samuel 20:31</a>). He had hoped to find a safe refuge with Achish, but had been disappointed. He was on the point of becoming a fugitive and an outlaw, a dweller in dens and caves of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>). He had as yet no body of followers. We cannot but admire his piety in composing, at such a time, a song of thanksgiving to God. <span class="cmt_word">His praise shall continually be in my mouth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-1.htm">Psalm 92:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-1.htm">Psalm 145:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-1.htm">Psalm 146:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>). "Continually" must be understood as meaning either "every day" or "many times every day," but must not be taken quite literally, or the business of life would be at a stand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/34.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>34:1-10 If we hope to spend eternity in praising God, it is fit that we should spend much of our time here in this work. He never said to any one, Seek ye me in vain. David's prayers helped to silence his fears; many besides him have looked unto the Lord by faith and prayer, and it has wonderfully revived and comforted them. When we look to the world, we are perplexed, and at a loss. But on looking to Christ depends our whole salvation, and all things needful thereunto do so also. This poor man, whom no man looked upon with any respect, or looked after with any concern, was yet welcome to the throne of grace; the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The holy angels minister to the saints, and stand for them against the powers of darkness. All the glory be to the Lord of the angels. By taste and sight we both make discoveries, and have enjoyment; Taste and see God's goodness; take notice of it, and take the comfort of it. He makes all truly blessed that trust in him. As to the things of the other world, they shall have grace sufficient for the support of spiritual life. And as to this life, they shall have what is necessary from the hand of God. Paul had all, and abounded, because he was content, Php 4:11-18. Those who trust to themselves, and think their own efforts sufficient for them, shall want; but they shall be fed who trust in the Lord. Those shall not want, who with quietness work, and mind their own business.</body></html>
