Comp. Keble's paraphrase.<p>"Even as a flock arrayed are they<p>For the dark grave; Death guides their way,<p>Death is their shepherd now."<p>The rendering, "feed on them," is an error. The rest of the verse as it stands is quite unintelligible. Among the many conjectured emendations, the best is (Burgess) to point the verb as the future of <span class= "ital">y?rad, </span>and render, "and the upright shall go down to the grave amongst them (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, amongst the ungodly) until the morning" (for the last words compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-4.htm" title="And there shall be no leavened bread seen with you in all your coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which you sacrificed the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.">Deuteronomy 16:4</a>), when in contrast to the wicked they shall see light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-20.htm" title="Man that is in honor, and understands not, is like the beasts that perish.">Psalm 49:20</a>).<p>Adopting this emendation, a new force is lent to the next two clauses, which have puzzled modern commentators, as they did the ancient translators (LXX., "their help shall grow old in hell from their glory.") By a slight change of points and accents, and taking <span class= "ital">mizbul </span>as a derivative noun equivalent to <span class= "ital">zebul </span>(so also Gratz), we get, "Their beauty (is) for corruption; sheol (is) its dwelling," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, all, wise and unwise, good and bad, must descend to the under world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm" title="Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.">Psalm 49:11</a>), so that the upright accompany the wicked thither, and it becomes the dwelling-place of their beauty, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, their bodies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">feed on them.</span> With the foolish fancies and vain conceits of the ungodly rich men, the psalmist now contrasts the reality. When they die they are "laid in the grave," or "ranged in Hades" (Kay), as sheep in a sheepfold. There is no escape for them. Death is their shepherd; he keeps them, watches over them, tends them, allows none to quit the fold. <span class="cmt_word">And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning</span>. When the resurrection morn comes - and no other explanation appears to be possible (see even Cheyne) - it will bring them no release; the righteous will then "have domination over them," and will certainly not set them free (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>). And their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling; rather, <span class="accented">and their beauty is for Hades to consume out of its dwelling</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its clay tenement (so Dr. Kay). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/49.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>49:6-14 Here is a description of the spirit and way of worldly people. A man may have wealth, and may have his heart enlarged in love, thankfulness, and obedience, and may do good with it. Therefore it is not men's having riches that proves them to be worldly, but their setting their hearts upon them as the best things. Worldly men have only some floating thoughts of the things of God, while their fixed thoughts, their inward thoughts, are about the world; that lies nearest the heart. But with all their wealth they cannot save the life of the dearest friend they have. This looks further, to the eternal redemption to be wrought out by the Messiah. The redemption of the soul shall cost very dear; but, being once wrought, it shall never need to be repeated. And he, the Redeemer, shall rise again before he sees corruption, and then shall live for evermore, Re 1:18. This likewise shows the folly of worldly people, who sell their souls for that which will never buy them. With all their wealth they cannot secure themselves from the stroke of death. Yet one generation after another applaud their maxims; and the character of a fool, as drawn by heavenly Wisdom itself, Lu 12:16-21, continues to be followed even among professed Christians. Death will ask the proud sinner, Where is thy wealth, thy pomp? And in the morning of the resurrection, when all that sleep in the dust shall awake, the upright shall be advanced to the highest honour, when the wicked shall be filled with everlasting shame and contempt, Da 12:2. Let us now judge of things as they will appear in that day. The beauty of holiness is that alone which the grave cannot touch, or damage.</body></html>
