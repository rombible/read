The LXX. and Vulgate have "problem," "proposition."<p>To open the riddle is not to <span class= "ital">solve </span>it, but to <span class= "ital">propound </span>it, as we say to "open a discourse." (Comp. St. Paul's phrase, "opening and alleging.") The full phrase is probably found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-26.htm" title="She opens her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.">Proverbs 31:26</a>, "She openeth her mouth with wisdom.'"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will incline mine ear to a</span> <span class="cmt_word">parable.</span> The psalmist is "like a minstrel who has to play a piece of music put into his hands. The strain is none of his own devising; and as he proceeds, each note awakes in him a mysterious echo, which he would fain catch and retain in memory" (Kay). A "<span class="accented">parable"</span> in the Old Testament means any enigmatical or dark saying, into which much metaphor or imagery is introduced, so that it is only <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">I will open my dark saying upon the harp;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a harp accompaniment.

Let all hear this with application to ourselves. The poor are in danger from undue desire toward the wealth of the world, as rich people from undue delight in it. The psalmist begins with applying it to himself, and that is the right method in which to treat of Divine things. Before he sets down the folly of carnal security, he lays down, from his own experience, the benefit and comfort of a holy, gracious security, which they enjoy who trust in God, and not in their worldly wealth. In the day of judgment, the iniquity of our heels, or of our steps, our past sins, will compass us. In those days, worldly, wicked people will be afraid; but wherefore should a man fear death who has God with him?</body></html>
