It is difficult to connect this with the preceding. But perhaps the link may be found in the double sense of <span class="accented">mishpatim</span>, "judgments," which includes verbal sentences against sinners delivered in the Law, and also actual sentences upon them in deed and fact. These last are in the writer's mind in the present verse - such judgments as those upon Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23-31</a>), Zerah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-15</a>), and Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-37</a>). That are cursed. This clause is questioned, as metrically redundant. But Hebrew metrology is scarcely as yet an exact science. And the clause finds its justification in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Which do err from thy commandments</span>. Such error brings under a curse those who commit it. If it be a blessed thing to walk in God's Law (ver. 1), it must be a cursed thing to transgress against it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>119:17-24 If God deals in strict justice with us, we all perish. We ought to spend our lives in his service; we shall find true life in keeping his word. Those that would see the wondrous things of God's law and gospel, must beg him to give them understanding, by the light of his Spirit. Believers feel themselves strangers on earth; they fear missing their way, and losing comfort by erring from God's commandments. Every sanctified soul hungers after the word of God, as food which there is no living without. There is something of pride at the bottom of every wilful sin. God can silence lying lips; reproach and contempt may humble and do us good, and then they shall be removed. Do we find the weight of the cross is above that we are able to bear? He that bore it for us will enable us to bear it; upheld by him we cannot sink. It is sad when those who should protect the innocent, are their betrayers. The psalmist went on in duty, and he found comfort in the word of God. The comforts of the word of God are most pleasant to a gracious soul, when other comforts are made bitter; and those that would have God's testimonies to be their delight, must be advised by them. May the Lord direct us in exercising repentance of sin, and faith in Christ.</body></html>
