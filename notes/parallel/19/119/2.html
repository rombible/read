A variant expression for keeping the Law, rather than the specification of a particular part of it. <span class="cmt_word">And that seek him with the whole heart</span>. This is the emphatic portion of the verse. An obedience "from the heart" is alone acceptable to God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-34.htm">Psalm 119:34, 58, 69, 145</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>119:1-8 This psalm may be considered as the statement of a believer's experience. As far as our views, desires, and affections agree with what is here expressed, they come from the influences of the Holy Spirit, and no further. The pardoning mercy of God in Christ, is the only source of a sinner's happiness. And those are most happy, who are preserved most free from the defilement of sin, who simply believe God's testimonies, and depend on his promises. If the heart be divided between him and the world, it is evil. But the saints carefully avoid all sin; they are conscious of much evil that clogs them in the ways of God, but not of that wickedness which draws them out of those ways. The tempter would make men think they are at them out of those ways. The tempter would make men think they are at liberty to follow the word of God or not, as they please. But the desire and prayer of a good man agree with the will and command of God. If a man expects by obedience in one thing to purchase indulgence for disobedience in others, his hypocrisy will be detected; if he is not ashamed in this world, everlasting shame will be his portion. The psalmist coveted to learn the laws of God, to give God the glory. And believers see that if God forsakes them, the temper will be too hard for them.</body></html>
