Keeping as close to the context as possible, the meaning will be: "To all perfection (or apparent perfection) a limit is visible, but the Divine Law is boundless alike in its scope and its requirements." This, translated into the language of modern ideas, merely says that the actual can never correspond with the ideal:<p>"Who keeps a spirit wholly true<p>To that ideal which he bears<span class= "ital">?"</span><p>But in the word <span class= "ital">end </span>in Hebrew, as in English, there is a limitation in time, as in space (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-10.htm" title="He has compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.">Job 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-3.htm" title="He sets an end to darkness, and searches out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.">Job 28:3</a>; comp. Symmachus, "I have seen the end of all settled things"), and the Prayer Book version may really give the psalmist's thought as indicating the difference between mere change and progress.<p>"The old order changeth, yielding place to new,<p>And God fulfils Himself in many ways,<p>Lest one good custom should corrupt the world."<p>TENNYSON: <span class= "ital">Morte d'Arthur.</span><p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 96.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have seen an end of all perfection</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to all other perfection I have seen, and see, a limit; but there is no limit to the perfection of thy Law. <span class="cmt_word">Thy commandment is exceeding broad</span>. Unlimited - measureless in its range. It inculcates on man an absolute perfection. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>119:89-96 The settling of God's word in heaven, is opposed to the changes and revolutions of the earth. And the engagements of God's covenant are established more firmly than the earth itself. All the creatures answer the ends of their creation: shall man, who alone is endued with reason, be the only unprofitable burden of the earth? We may make the Bible a pleasant companion at any time. But the word, without the grace of God, would not quicken us. See the best help for bad memories, namely, good affections; and though the exact words be lost, if the meaning remain, that is well. I am thine, not my own, not the world's; save me from sin, save me from ruin. The Lord will keep the man in peace, whose mind is stayed on him. It is poor perfection which one sees and end of. Such are all things in this world, which pass for perfections. The glory of man is but as the flower of the grass. The psalmist had seen the fulness of the word of God, and its sufficiency. The word of the Lord reaches to all cases, to all times. It will take us from all confidence in man, or in our own wisdom, strength, and righteousness. Thus shall we seek comfort and happiness from Christ alone.</body></html>
