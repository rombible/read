The Revised Version has "hot indignation" instead of "horror;" and so Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hengstenberg, Cheyne, Professor Alexander, and others; but Dr. Kay well defends the Authorized Version ('The Psalms,' Appendix 1. pp. 462, 463). The feeling intended probably resembled that described by Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6</a>). The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>of the LXX. does not ill express it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>119:49-56 Those that make God's promises their portion, may with humble boldness make them their plea. He that by his Spirit works faith in us, will work for us. The word of God speaks comfort in affliction. If, through grace, it makes us holy, there is enough in it to make us easy, in all conditions. Let us be certain we have the Divine law for what we believe, and then let not scoffers prevail upon us to decline from it. God's judgments of old comfort and encourage us, for he is still the same. Sin is horrible in the eyes of all that are sanctified. Ere long the believer will be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. In the mean time, the statutes of the Lord supply subjects for grateful praise. In the season of affliction, and in the silent hours of the night, he remembers the name of the Lord, and is stirred up to keep the law. All who have made religion the first thing, will own that they have been unspeakable gainers by it.</body></html>
