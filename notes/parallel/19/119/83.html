The wine-skin would, of course, shrivel, if hung above a fire, and would afford an apt image of the effect of trouble on an individual or community. "As wine-skin in the smoke my heart is sere and dried." Some think that as a bottle hung up anywhere in an ancient house would be in the smoke, nothing more is implied than its being set aside; but this is too weak.<p>We find in the ancient poets allusion to the custom of mellowing wine by heat:<p>"Prodit fumoso condita vina cado."--OVID: <span class= "ital">Fast. v.</span> 517.<p>(Comp. Hor. <span class= "ital">Ode </span>iii. 8, 9, 10). And so some understand the image here of the good results of the discipline of suffering. The LXX. and Vulg., instead of <span class= "ital">smoke, </span>have "hoar-frost." The Hebrew word has this meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm" title="Fire, and hail; snow, and vapors; stormy wind fulfilling his word:">Psalm 148:8</a>, but in the only other place where it occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-28.htm" title="And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, see, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.">Genesis 19:28</a>) it is <span class= "ital">smoke. </span>The possibility of rendering <span class= "ital">hoar-frost </span>here suggests another explanation. The word <span class= "ital">nod </span>(bottle) may be used of a <span class= "ital">cloud, </span>and as the psalmist has just spoken of his eyes failing, we may have here only another expression for weeping.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 83.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I am become like a bottle in the smoke</span>. Keble's paraphrase brings out the true sense - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"As wine-skin in the smoke,<br />My heart is sere and dried."</span> Wine-skins were smoked to toughen and harden them. <span class="cmt_word">Yet do I not forget thy statutes.</span> The severity of the discipline does not alienate me from thee, or cause me to depart from thy Law (comp. vers. 23, 51, 161). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>119:81-88 The psalmist sought deliverance from his sins, his foes, and his fears. Hope deferred made him faint; his eyes failed by looking out for this expected salvation. But when the eyes fail, yet faith must not. His affliction was great. He was become like a leathern bottle, which, if hung up in the smoke, is dried and shrivelled up. We must ever be mindful of God's statutes. The days of the believer's mourning shall be ended; they are but for a moment, compared with eternal happiness. His enemies used craft as well as power for his ruin, in contempt of the law of God. The commandments of God are true and faithful guides in the path of peace and safety. We may best expect help from God when, like our Master, we do well and suffer for it. Wicked men may almost consume the believer upon earth, but he would sooner forsake all than forsake the word of the Lord. We should depend upon the grace of God for strength to do every good work. The surest token of God's good-will toward us, is his good work in us.</body></html>
