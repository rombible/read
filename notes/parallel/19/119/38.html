There are two renderings, each in accordance with the general drift of the psalm: (1) <span class= "ital">Stablish to Thy servant Thy word, which leads to fear of Thee; </span>or, more likely, (2) <span class= "ital">Stablish to Thy servant Thy promise which is to those who fear Thee, </span>as apparently the LXX.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stablish thy Word unto thy servant</span>; or, "make good thy promise unto thy servant" - thy promise of aid and support in all times of temptation and difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">Who is devoted to thy fear</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which belongeth unto thy fear</span>. The antecedent to the relative is "word" or "promise," and not "servant;" and the prayer is that God will make good to his servant that promise, which lies at the root of all reverence and godly fear (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>, "There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>119:33-40 Teach me thy statutes, not the mere words, but the way of applying them to myself. God, by his Spirit, gives a right understanding. But the Spirit of revelation in the word will not suffice, unless we have the Spirit of wisdom in the heart. God puts his Spirit within us, causing us to walk in his statutes. The sin here prayed against is covetousness. Those that would have the love of God rooted in them, must get the love of the world rooted out; for the friendship of the world is enmity with God. Quicken me in thy way; to redeem time, and to do every duty with liveliness of spirit. Beholding vanity deadens us, and slackens our pace; a traveller must not stand gazing upon every object that presents itself to his view. The promises of God's word greatly relate to the preservation of the true believer. When Satan has drawn a child of God into worldly compliances, he will reproach him with the falls into which he led him. Victory must come from the cross of Christ. When we enjoy the sweetness of God's precepts, it will make us long for more acquaintance with them. And where God has wrought to will, he will work to do.</body></html>
