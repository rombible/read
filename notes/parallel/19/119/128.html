It is true that the expression, <span class= "ital">all precepts of all, </span>may be explained as a strengthened form of <span class= "ital">all precepts</span>--as we say, "all and every"--though the passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm" title="And the first of all the first fruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: you shall also give to the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in your house.">Ezekiel 44:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-16.htm" title="For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them to me.">Numbers 8:16</a>) generally adduced are not strictly analogous. But the Lexicons supply no authority for taking the verb <span class= "ital">y?shar </span>in the sense of "esteem right," and the figure of the path in the next clause seems here plainly to fix its meaning.

"Eclecticism of every kind in reference to the Word of God is rejected" (Hengstenberg). And I hate every false way (comp. vers. 104, 163).

Christ our Surety, having paid our debt and ransom, secures all the blessings of salvation to every true believer. The psalmist expects the word of God's righteousness, and no other salvation than what is secured by that word, which cannot fall to the ground. We deserve no favour form God; we are most easy when we cast ourselves upon God's mercy, and refer ourselves to it. If any man resolve to do God's will as his servant, he shall be made to know his testimonies. We must do what we can for the support of religion, and, after all, must beg of God to take the work into his own hands. It is hypocrisy to say we love God's commandments more than our worldly interests. The way of sin is a false way, being directly contrary to God's precepts, which are right: those that love and esteem God's law, hate sin, and will not be reconciled to it.</body></html>
