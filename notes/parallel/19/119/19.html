Human intelligence does not suffice to fathom the will of God. The mortal is a stranger on the earth; both time and strength are wanting to attain to knowledge which only Divine wisdom can teach.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am a stranger in the earth</span>; or, "a sojourner" (Cheyne, Kay, Revised Version); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>. Earth is not our true home. We all "seek a country." <span class="cmt_word">Hide not thy commandments from me</span>. God "hides" things from the wise and prudent which he reveals to "babes." The psalmist prays that the true meaning of God's Word may not be kept back from him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>119:17-24 If God deals in strict justice with us, we all perish. We ought to spend our lives in his service; we shall find true life in keeping his word. Those that would see the wondrous things of God's law and gospel, must beg him to give them understanding, by the light of his Spirit. Believers feel themselves strangers on earth; they fear missing their way, and losing comfort by erring from God's commandments. Every sanctified soul hungers after the word of God, as food which there is no living without. There is something of pride at the bottom of every wilful sin. God can silence lying lips; reproach and contempt may humble and do us good, and then they shall be removed. Do we find the weight of the cross is above that we are able to bear? He that bore it for us will enable us to bear it; upheld by him we cannot sink. It is sad when those who should protect the innocent, are their betrayers. The psalmist went on in duty, and he found comfort in the word of God. The comforts of the word of God are most pleasant to a gracious soul, when other comforts are made bitter; and those that would have God's testimonies to be their delight, must be advised by them. May the Lord direct us in exercising repentance of sin, and faith in Christ.</body></html>
