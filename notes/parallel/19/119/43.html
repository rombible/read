"The word of truth" here is the "well-grounded answer" that the psalmist looks to make to those who reproach him (Hengstenberg). (See the preceding verse.) If God does not grant him "mercy and salvation" (ver. 41), this answer will be "taken out of his mouth." <span class="cmt_word">For I have hoped in thy judgments.</span> I have trusted in thy vindication of my character, and in thy judgments upon my foes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>119:41-48 Lord, I have by faith thy mercies in view; let me by prayer prevail to obtain them. And when the salvation of the saints is completed, it will plainly appear that it was not in vain to trust in God's word. We need to pray that we may never be afraid or ashamed to own God's truths and ways before men. And the psalmist resolves to keep God's law, in a constant course of obedience, without backsliding. The service of sin is slavery; the service of God is liberty. There is no full happiness, or perfect liberty, but in keeping God's law. We must never be ashamed or afraid to own our religion. The more delight we take in the service of God, the nearer we come to perfection. Not only consent to his law as good, but take pleasure in it as good for us. Let me put forth all the strength I have, to do it. Something of this mind of Christ is in every true disciple.</body></html>
