But while this may be a legitimate application of the close of this remarkable composition, and while the LXX. suggest a comparison with our Lord's parable by their rendering (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-11.htm" title="For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-10.htm" title="For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.">Luke 19:10</a>), this could hardly have been the intention of the words of this verse. More likely there is a reference to the condition of the community, for the word rendered "lost" (literally, <span class= "ital">perishing</span>) is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.">Isaiah 27:13</a> of the exiled Hebrews, and is rendered "outcasts;" the emphatic "I do not forget Thy commandments," which is the real close of the psalm, seems to make this view imperative.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 176.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have gone astray like a lost sheep</span> (comp. ver. 67). Some see in this verse nothing but a reference to the outward circumstances of the psalmist's life. But this is certainly not the idea generally attached in Scripture to the image of the "lost sheep" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>). Dean Johnson's exposition is probably correct, "I have wandered far from thee and from home, as a sheep lost and ready to perish in the wilderness." <span class="cmt_word">Seek thy servant</span>. "Seek him, lest he be not able of himself to seek thee; and bring him again to thy fold." <span class="cmt_word">For I do not forget thy commandments</span>. In my worst wanderings I have not fallen away wholly from thee. Thy Law has been ever in my thoughts. I have not "forgotten" it, but meditated on it and longed for it (vers. 15, 20, 40). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>119:169-176 The psalmist desired grace and strength to lift up his prayers, and that the Lord would receive and notice them. He desired to know more of God in Christ; to know more of the doctrines of the word, and the duties of religion. He had a deep sense of unworthiness, and holy fear that his prayer should not come before God; Lord, what I pray for is, what thou hast promised. We have learned nothing to purpose, if we have not learned to praise God. We should always make the word of God the rule of our discourse, so as never to transgress it by sinful speaking, or sinful silence. His own hands are not sufficient, nor can any creature lend him help; therefore he looks up to God, that the hand that had made him may help him. He had made religion his deliberate choice. There is an eternal salvation all the saints long for, and therefore they pray that God would help their way to it. Let thy judgments help me; let all ordinances and all providences, (both are God's judgments,) further me in glorifying God; let them help me for that work. He often looks back with shame and gratitude to his lost estate. He still prays for the tender care of Him who purchased his flock with his own blood, that he may receive from him the gift of eternal life. Seek me, that is, Find me; for God never seeks in vain. Turn me, and I shall be turned. Let this psalm be a touchstone by which to try our hearts, and our lives. Do our hearts, cleansed in Christ's blood, make these prayers, resolutions and confessions our own? Is God's word the standard of our faith, and the law of our practice? Do we use it as pleas with Christ for what we need? Happy those who live in such delightful exercises.</body></html>
