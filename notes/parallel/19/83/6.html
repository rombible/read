Edom was always among the bitterest of Israel's enemies, and naturally took a part in almost every combination that was made against them. Though sometimes subjugated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>), it continued hostile during the whole period of Israelite and Jewish history. Hence the constant denunciations of the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-4.htm">Malachi 1:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the Ishmaelites.</span> The Ishmaelites were the chief inhabitants of Northern Arabia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13-18</a>). They do not often appear among Israel's enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Of Moab.</span> Moab, on the contrary, is a persistent adversary (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-6.htm">Numbers 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4-27</a>; 26:2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the Hagarenes.</span> The "Hagarenes," or "Hagarites," are only mentioned here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-10.htm">1 Chronicles 5:10, 19-22</a>. They were probably a branch of the Ishmaelites, named after Hagar, Ishmael's mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-12.htm">Genesis 25:12</a>). Their name occurs among those of Aramman tribes in the Assyrian inscriptions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/83.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>83:1-8 Sometimes God seems not to be concerned at the unjust treatment of his people. But then we may call upon him, as the psalmist here. All wicked people are God's enemies, especially wicked persecutors. The Lord's people are his hidden one; the world knows them not. He takes them under his special protection. Do the enemies of the church act with one consent to destroy it, and shall not the friends of the church be united? Wicked men wish that there might be no religion among mankind. They would gladly see all its restraints shaken off, and all that preach, profess, or practise it, cut off. This they would bring to pass if it were in their power. The enemies of God's church have always been many: this magnifies the power of the Lord in preserving to himself a church in the world.</body></html>
