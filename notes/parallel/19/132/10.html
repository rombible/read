In the original (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm" title="O LORD God, turn not away the face of your anointed: remember the mercies of David your servant.">2Chronicles 6:42</a>) it is of course Solomon who prays for himself; here (see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>) we must naturally think of one of the Asmonean princes. The expression "to turn away the face," of a suppliant, instead of "turning from him," is borrowed from court etiquette. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-16.htm" title="And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.">1Kings 2:16</a>, margin.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/132.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</span> Here the text diverges still more from that of Chronicles, which runs thus: "O Lord God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant" The meaning, however, is much the same in both passages: "For David's sake, to whom thou hast shown so many mercies, turn not away the face - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. reject not the petition, or the offering - of his representative." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>132:1-10 David bound himself to find a place for the Lord, for the ark, the token of God's presence. When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.</body></html>
