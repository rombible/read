The vow in which David declared his purpose has just been quoted, and that which is now said to have been heard and found can hardly be anything else than this purpose. In fact, the <span class= "ital">feminine </span>suffix to the verbs points directly back to the word rendered <span class= "ital">afflictions </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-1.htm" title="Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:">Psalm 132:1</a>, which is really a feminine form. This being settled, we need not go from the plain direction of such places as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm" title="And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-7.htm" title="And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.">Genesis 48:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm" title="And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:">Ruth 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a>, which pronounce the identity of Ephratah with Bethlehem, to seek any other locality which might possibly be so called. David's purpose would naturally be connected--especially after a long lapse of time--with the birthplace of his family. But though taking this poetical licence, the psalm keeps sufficiently close to history as to recognise in the discovery of the Ark at Kirjath-jearim an important, nay, a decisive step in the project of building the Temple. Though his purpose may not have been even dimly defined to David when he moved the Ark, history justly sees in that momentous change the initial step in the grander undertaking. That <span class= "ital">"</span>the fields of the wood" (Heb., <span class= "ital">sedey-y?'ar</span>) is one designation of Kirjath-jearim (city of Yaarim, which went by so many names: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-20.htm" title="And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.">Jeremiah 26:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-25.htm" title="The children of Kirjatharim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty and three.">Ezra 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/15-10.htm" title="And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:">Joshua 15:10-11</a>) there can be little doubt. We must not, of course, think here of David's contemporaries, but of those of the psalmist, who poetically are represented as taking important part in the early plans for building the Temple--just as we might say, speaking of our old cathedrals, "we built fine churches in those days." The poet makes them say, identifying themselves with the people of those distant times, while naturally the historical correctness suffers, "We heard his project at Bethlehem; we found out <span class= "ital">its </span>meaning (saw it take shape) at Kirjath-jearim." For <span class= "ital">m?tsa, </span>in the sense of "finding out the meaning or discerning," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-12.htm" title="And Samson said to them, I will now put forth a riddle to you: if you can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:">Judges 14:12</a>, "of a riddle." This sentence reminds one of a riddle by its form.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/132.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-10.</span> - The realization of David's design. The resting-place is, after a time, discovered and prepared. The ark is brought up and placed in it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1-11</a>). The "priests" are" clothed with righteousness," and the "saints shout for joy." God "turns not away the face of his anointed," but accepts the costly offering. God himself "arises into his rest," and makes his presence visible from the mercy-seat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah</span>. "It" is probably "the ark" - not yet mentioned, but a main object of the writer's thoughts; and "Ephratah" is the district south and west of Jerusalem, in which both Bethlehem and Kirjath-jearim were situated. <span class="cmt_word">And found it in the fields of the wood</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the fields of Jaar</span>. "Jaar" is a contracted and poetic name for Kirjath-jearim, where the ark remained from its return out of the country of the Philistines till David transferred it to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5-13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>132:1-10 David bound himself to find a place for the Lord, for the ark, the token of God's presence. When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.</body></html>
