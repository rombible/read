Some think that they are there only as a quotation from this psalm, but the mode in which the words are here introduced points the other way. The psalmist does not at his distance from the events distinguish between David and Solomon. He merges the executor of the work in the projector; and in honour of the second Temple it is as natural for him to take up words used at the actual dedication of the first as it was to refer to the original purpose in David's mind. All is blended together in the long perspective of poetry. As to the form of the words, they are of course themselves a reminiscence of the ancient battle-cry of the nation when the Ark set forward on the march. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-1.htm" title="Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.">Psalm 68:1</a>, Note.) The mention of the <span class= "ital">Ark </span>does not definitely dispose of the Maccabaean theory of this psalm, though it doubtless must weigh against it. The quotation may have been adopted generally without meaning literal correspondence between all the circumstances--just as the battle-cry had become merely a <span class= "ital">religious </span>formula--or, as Lightfoot and Prideaux suggest (see Prideaux, <span class= "ital">Connection, </span>i. 141), there may have been an ark made for the second Temple in imitation of the original.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Ark of thy strength.</span>--See the reference in Chronicles. The expression occurs nowhere else but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-61.htm" title="And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.">Psalm 78:61</a>, where the word <span class= "ital">strength </span>by itself denotes the <span class= "ital">ark. </span>The technical word <span class= "ital">ark </span>nowhere else occurs in the psalms. For <span class= "ital">strength </span>the LXX. and Vulg. have "sanctification."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/132.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arise, O Lord, into thy rest</span>. Another transfer, but into the place of final "rest." The words are a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a>:41, and were uttered originally by Solomon at the close of his long dedication prayer. <span class="cmt_word">Thou, and the ark of thy strength</span>. The quotation continues. God is regarded as entering the temple, and taking possession of it, in and with the ark. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>132:1-10 David bound himself to find a place for the Lord, for the ark, the token of God's presence. When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.</body></html>
