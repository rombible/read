The "place" which David desired to "find" was a permanent resting-place for the ark of God, which he had already "brought up from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with gladness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>), but which he had only established in a temporary abode of the nature of a tent, or tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>). God approved David's zeal, but did not allow him to accomplish his design (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An habitation for the mighty God of Jacob</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Mighty One of Jacob</span> (comp. ver. 2 and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>132:1-10 David bound himself to find a place for the Lord, for the ark, the token of God's presence. When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.</body></html>
