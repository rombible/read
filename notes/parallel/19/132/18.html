This allusion is rendered more probable by the use of the word rendered "flourish" (properly, <span class= "ital">shine</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>a cognate to which was the technical name given to this golden plate. (See the reference in Exodus 39, above.)

But if the Maccabaean hypothesis is correct, the use of the word, instead of the more usual word for "crown," is interesting. "One relic of the ancient insignia has been preserved, which was probably prized as the most precious of all. It was the golden plate affixed to the turban, inscribed 'Holiness to Jehovah,' which was believed to have come down from the time of Aaron, and which, treasured through all the vicissitudes of the Jewish state, was carried to Rome by Titus, and seen there by the great Jewish Rabbi, in the time of Hadrian" (Stanley, J. <span class= "ital">C. </span>3:353).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/132.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His enemies will I clothe with shame</span>.

How vast is the love of God to man, that he should speak thus concerning his church! It is his desire to dwell with us; yet how little do we desire to dwell with him! He abode in Zion till the sins of Israel caused him to give them up to the spoilers. Forsake us not, O God, and deliver us not in like manner, sinful though we are. God's people have a special blessing on common enjoyments, and that blessing puts peculiar sweetness into them. Zion's poor have reason to be content with a little of this world, because they have better things prepared for them. God will abundantly bless the nourishment of the new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with the bread of life. He gives more than we ask, and when he gives salvation, he will give abundant joy. God would bring to nothing every design formed to destroy the house of David, until King Messiah should arise out of it, to sit upon the throne of his Father. In him all the promises centre. His enemies, who will not have him to reign over them, shall at the last day be clothed with shame and confusion for ever.</body></html>
