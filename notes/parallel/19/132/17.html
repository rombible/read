The Messianic application of this prediction comes out in Zechariah's song (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-69.htm" title="And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;">Luke 1:69</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I have ordained a lamp.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">I have trimmed a lamp; </span>the word used in connection with the sacred lights, under the express charge of Aaron and his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-21.htm" title="In the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever to their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.">Exodus 27:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/24-2.htm" title="Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.">Leviticus 24:2-3</a>). But with this distinctly sacerdotal allusion we must also combine the special allusion to the Davidic dynasty, according to the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm" title="And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.">1Kings 11:36</a>): "That David my servant may have a light (or, <span class= "ital">lamp, </span>as here) always before me in Jerusalem."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/132.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There will I make the horn of David to bud</span>. The "horn of David" budded most gloriously when "a rod came forth out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch grew out of his roots, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1, 2</a>) - in other words, when Messiah appeared, and re-established the Davidian kingdom, which thenceforth has endured, and will endure for ever. <span class="cmt_word">I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</span> The metaphor is changed; but the idea is the same. Christ's coming shed a glory on David's house, and on the temple, and on David himself, such as had never previously illumined them. David is often promised "a lamp" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-19.htm">2 Kings 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-7.htm">2 Chronicles 21:7</a>). In Christ the lamp was given. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>132:11-18 The Lord never turns from us when we plead the covenant with his anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. How vast is the love of God to man, that he should speak thus concerning his church! It is his desire to dwell with us; yet how little do we desire to dwell with him! He abode in Zion till the sins of Israel caused him to give them up to the spoilers. Forsake us not, O God, and deliver us not in like manner, sinful though we are. God's people have a special blessing on common enjoyments, and that blessing puts peculiar sweetness into them. Zion's poor have reason to be content with a little of this world, because they have better things prepared for them. God will abundantly bless the nourishment of the new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with the bread of life. He gives more than we ask, and when he gives salvation, he will give abundant joy. God would bring to nothing every design formed to destroy the house of David, until King Messiah should arise out of it, to sit upon the throne of his Father. In him all the promises centre. His enemies, who will not have him to reign over them, shall at the last day be clothed with shame and confusion for ever.</body></html>
