This passage is based mainly on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>, but contains likewise expressions which seem taken from other psalms, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-16.htm">Psalm 68:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-14.htm">Psalm 147:14</a>. The chief promise is that of a special "fruit of his body" to be "set upon his throne" (ver. 11) and to reign in Zion forever (vers. 13, 14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3, 35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will not turn from it</span>.

How vast is the love of God to man, that he should speak thus concerning his church! It is his desire to dwell with us; yet how little do we desire to dwell with him! He abode in Zion till the sins of Israel caused him to give them up to the spoilers. Forsake us not, O God, and deliver us not in like manner, sinful though we are. God's people have a special blessing on common enjoyments, and that blessing puts peculiar sweetness into them. Zion's poor have reason to be content with a little of this world, because they have better things prepared for them. God will abundantly bless the nourishment of the new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with the bread of life. He gives more than we ask, and when he gives salvation, he will give abundant joy. God would bring to nothing every design formed to destroy the house of David, until King Messiah should arise out of it, to sit upon the throne of his Father. In him all the promises centre. His enemies, who will not have him to reign over them, shall at the last day be clothed with shame and confusion for ever.</body></html>
