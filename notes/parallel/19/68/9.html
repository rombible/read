Thy living creatures dwell therein; thou makest provision of thy goodness for the afflicted, O God. </span>The rain of gifts has been variously explained as <span class= "ital">actual showers, blessings of prosperity, outpourings of the Holy Spirit. </span>Both the latter might no doubt be implied in the expression, but some particular material blessing seems indicated, and in connection with the desert wanderings the <span class= "ital">rain of manna </span>suggests itself. By <span class= "ital">thine inheritance </span>we understand God's <span class= "ital">people, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm" title="But the LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as you are this day.">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-9.htm" title="Save your people, and bless your inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.">Psalm 28:9</a>, &c. The "living creatures" in the next verse will then probably be the <span class= "ital">quails; </span>and a slight emendation, lately suggested, carries conviction along with it. It consists in bringing "thy living creatures" into <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm" title="You, O God, did send a plentiful rain, whereby you did confirm your inheritance, when it was weary.">Psalm 68:9</a>, and, by the insertion of a letter, to read instead of "they dwell therein"--<span class= "ital">they are satisfied with it </span>(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-24.htm" title="And had rained down manna on them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.">Psalm 78:24-25</a>). This gives the rendering, <span class= "ital">and when it was exhausted thou didst refresh it with thy living creatures; they are satisfied therewith. </span>(Burgess.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain.</span> Not a literal rain, but a shower of blessings - manna, quails, water out of the rock, protection against enemies, victories, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Whereby thou didst confirm</span> (or, <span class="accented">establish</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thine inheritance</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When it was weary.</span> The wandering in the wilderness must have been inexpressibly dull and wearisome, especially to those who had left Egypt with the hope of a quick march through the waste, and a speedy entrance into "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>). The "establishment" in Palestine under Joshua was a blessing that could not but be highly valued after well nigh a century of cruel bondage in Egypt, and forty years of aimless wandering in the Sinaitic peninsula. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>68:7-14 Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies. If God bring his people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be as the wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold. Full salvation will render those white as snow, who were vile and loathsome through the guilt and defilement of sin.</body></html>
