In these patriotic recollections the poet is naturally inspired by the strains of former odes of victory and freedom. The music especially of Deborah's mighty song (Judges 5), which, directly or indirectly, coloured so much of later Hebrew poetry (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; Habakkuk 3) is in his ears throughout.<p><span class= "bld">Wentest forth . . . didst march.</span>--The parallel clauses as well as the words employed have, in the sound and sequence, a martial tread. The latter word, "didst march," is peculiar to Judges 5, Habakkuk 3, and this psalm.<p><span class= "bld">Even Sinai itself.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">this Sinai. </span>(See Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-5.htm" title="The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.">Judges 5:5</a>, where the clause completing the parallelism, here omitted, is retained, and shows us that the predicate to be supplied here is <span class= "ital">melted.</span>)<p>"The mountain melted from before Jehovah,<p>This Sinai from before Jehovah, God of Israel."<p>The demonstrative "this Sinai" appears more natural if we suppose the verse, even in Deborah's song, to be an echo or fragment of some older pieces contemporary with the Exodus itself. Such fragments of ancient poetry actually survive in some of the historical books--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-17.htm" title="Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing you to it:">Numbers 21:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-1.htm" title="Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:1-19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God setteth the solitary in families;</span> or, <span class="accented">in a home</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. gives "solitary ones" - outcasts, wanderers - a home to dwell in. The reference is to the settlement of the nomadic Israelites in Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">He bringeth out those which are bound</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-7.htm">Psalm 146:7</a>, "The Lord looseth the prisoners;" and compare the many references to the "bondage" of Israel in Egypt). The Exodus is glanced at, but not exclusively. God "brings men out" from the tyranny of worldly oppressors, of ghostly enemies, and of their own lusts and sins. <span class="cmt_word">With chains;</span> rather, <span class="accented">into prosperity</span> (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">But the rebellious dwell in a dry land.</span> Rebels against God are not "brought out." They are left to dwell in the "dry land" of their own impenitence and self-will (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>68:1-6 None ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. God is the joy of his people, then let them rejoice when they come before him. He who derives his being from none, but gives being to all, is engaged by promise and covenant to bless his people. He is to be praised as a God of mercy and tender compassion. He ever careth for the afflicted and oppressed: repenting sinners, who are helpless and exposed more than any fatherless children, are admitted into his family, and share all their blessings.</body></html>
