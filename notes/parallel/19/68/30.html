So LXX. and Vulgate. The <span class= "ital">beast of the reed </span>is undoubtedly symbolical of Egypt, whether it be the <span class= "ital">crocodile </span>or the <span class= "ital">hippopotamus.</span><p><span class= "bld">Bulls . . . calves.</span>--These are possibly emblems respectively of the <span class= "ital">strong </span>and the <span class= "ital">weak</span>--the <span class= "ital">princes </span>and the <span class= "ital">common people. </span>(Comp., for a somewhat similar description of the Egyptians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/76-5.htm" title="The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.">Psalm 76:5-6</a>.) But a slight emendation suggested by Gratz gives <span class= "ital">the herd of bulls despisers of the people, </span>a reading quite in keeping with the ordinary use of this figure. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.">Jeremiah 1:11</a>.) The figure in connection with the <span class= "ital">bull-worship </span>of Egypt is especially significant.<p><span class= "bld">Till every one submit.</span>--This clause still waits for a satisfactory explanation. The Authorised Version is intelligible, but grammatically indefensible. The LXX. are undoubtedly right in taking the verb as a contracted infinitive preceded by a negative particle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.">Genesis 27:1</a>), and not as a participle. The meaning <span class= "ital">submit </span>or <span class= "ital">humble </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm" title="Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.">Proverbs 6:3</a>) is only with violence deduced from the original meaning of the verb, which (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm" title="After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.">Daniel 7:7</a>) means to <span class= "ital">stamp </span>like a furious animal. One cognate is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-18.htm" title="Seems it a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but you must foul the residue with your feet?">Ezekiel 34:18</a>) of a herd of bulls fouling the pasture with their feet, and another means to <span class= "ital">tread. </span>The form of the verb here used might mean <span class= "ital">to set oneself in quick motion, </span>which is the sense adopted by the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm" title="Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.">Proverbs 6:3</a>. Hence we get <span class= "ital">rebuke </span><span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "ital">from marching for pieces of silver, </span>the meaning being that a rebuke is administered not only to Egypt, but also to those Jews who took the pay of Egypt as mercenaries, and oppressed the rest of the community, a sense in keeping with the next clause.<p><span class= "bld">Scatter.</span>--The verb, as pointed, means <span class= "ital">hath scattered, </span>but the LXX. support the alteration to the imperative which the context demands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke the company of spear men;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the wild beast of the reeds</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the crocodile or the hippopotamus, either of which may well symbolize the empire of Egypt, the mightiest of the heathen powers in David's time. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude of the bulls</span> represents other heathen powers, Assyria perhaps especially, which had the human-headed and winged bull for its principal emblem. <span class="cmt_word">With the calves of the people;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of peoples</span> - an obscure phrase, perhaps meaning inferior powers. Till every one <span class="cmt_word">submit himself with pieces of silver;</span> literally, (each) <span class="accented">submitting himself to thee with pieces of silver</span>. This is given as the result of the rebukes. When the various earth powers have been "rebuked" or chastised by God, then they will submit to bring gifts, or pay tribute, to Israel (comp. ver. 18). <span class="cmt_word">Scatter thou the people that delight in war.</span> This is exegetical of the first clause - rebuke these various world powers that delight in war by "scattering" them, or putting them to flight before their enemies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>68:29-31 A powerful invitation is given to those that are without, to join the church. Some shall submit from fear; overcome by their consciences, and the checks of Providence, they are brought to make peace with the church. Others will submit willingly, ver. 29,31. There is that beauty and benefit in the service of God, and in the gospel of Christ which went forth from Jerusalem, which is enough to invite sinners out of all nations.</body></html>
