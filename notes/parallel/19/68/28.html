First, he prays that God will complete the work which he has begun by continually strengthening Israel (ver. 28). Then he rises to prophecy. Kings and princes shall bring presents to Zion; empires shall prostrate themselves; Egypt and Ethiopia shall hasten to bow down; all the kingdoms of the earth shall ultimately "sing praises unto the Lord." Israel and the God of Israel will thus be glorified exceedingly. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy God hath commanded</span> (or, <span class="accented">ordained</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thy strength.</span> It is fixed in the Divine counsels that Israel shall be strong.

The kingdom of the Messiah shall be submitted to by all the rulers and learned in the world. The people seem to address the king, ver. 28. But the words are applicable to the Redeemer, to his church, and every true believer. We pray, that thou, O God the Son, wilt complete thine undertaking for us, by finishing thy good work in us.</body></html>
