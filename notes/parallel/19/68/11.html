It is also full of curious transitions, and of ellipses which make the meaning doubtful. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord gave the word.</span> The reader naturally asks - What word? Commentators answer variously: "the watchword" (Cheyne); "promise of victory" (Kay); "the word of command" (Dean Johnson); "announcement of an actual victory gained" (Hengstenberg). I should rather understand a sort of creative word, initiating the period of strife (comp. Shakespeare's "Cry havock, and let slip the dogs of war!"). <span class="cmt_word">Great was the company of those that published it;</span> literally, <span class="accented">great was the company of the women that heralded it</span>. The reference is to the female choirs which took a prominent part in the war songs of ancient days (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-1.htm">Judges 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6, 7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>68:7-14 Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies. If God bring his people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be as the wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold. Full salvation will render those white as snow, who were vile and loathsome through the guilt and defilement of sin.</body></html>
