If we could recover the allusions, the language would probably appear clear enough.<p>"Why rest ye among the sheepfolds?<span class= "ital">"</span><p>"A dove's wings are (now) covered with silver, and her<p>feathers with the sheen of gold."<p>"When the Almighty scattered kings there,<p>It was snowing on Tsalmon."<p>Even in our ignorance of these allusions we at once recognise in the first member of this antique verse the scornful inquiry of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm" title="Why stayed you among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.">Judges 5:16</a>, addressed to the inglorious tribe that preferred ease at home to the dangers and discomforts of battle.<p>The word here rendered "sheepfolds" (in the Authorised Version <span class= "ital">pots, </span>a meaning which cannot represent the Hebrew word or its cognates in any other place) is cognate to that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm" title="Why stayed you among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.">Judges 5:16</a>, and occurs in its present form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-43.htm" title="And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.">Ezekiel 40:43</a>, where the margin renders, "andirons, or two hearthstones." The derivation from <span class= "ital">to set </span>would allow of its application to any kind of <span class= "ital">barrier.</span><p>Whether Reuben, as in Deborah's song, or Issachar, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-14.htm" title="Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:">Genesis 49:14</a>, where a cognate word occurs ("burdens"), were the original stay-at-home, does not matter. The interest lies in the covert allusion made by the psalmist in his quotation to some cowardly or recreant party now playing the same disgraceful game.<p>The next clause, which has caused so much trouble to commentators, appears perfectly intelligible if treated as the answer made to the taunting question, and as simply a note of time:--they stayed at home because all nature was gay and joyous with summer. There is no authority for taking the rich plumage of the dove as emblematic of peace or plenty. The dove appears, indeed, in the Bible as a type, but only, as in all other literature, as a type of love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-14.htm" title="O my dove, that are in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see your countenance, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.">Song of Solomon 2:14</a>); whereas the appearance of this bird was in Palestine, as that of the swallow with us, a customary mark of time. (See Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-12.htm" title="The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;">Song of Solomon 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-14.htm" title="O my dove, that are in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see your countenance, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.">Song of Solomon 2:14</a>.) And a verse of a modern poet shows how naturally its full plumage might indicate the approach of summer:--<p>"In the spring a lovelier iris changes on the burnished dove."<p>--TENNYSON: <span class= "ital">Locksley Hall.</span><p>This reply calls forth from the first speaker a rejoinder in companion terms. The inglorious tribe plead summer joys as an excuse for ease. The reply tells of the devotion and ardour of those who, even amid the rigour of an exceptional winter, took up arms for their country: <span class= "ital">When the AImighty scattered kings there, it was snowing on Tsalmon. </span>(For the geography of Tsalmon, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-48.htm" title="And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.">Judges 9:48</a>.) Whether intentionally or not, the sense of the severity of the snowstorm--rare in Palestinian winters--is heightened by the contrast implied in the name "Dark" or "Shadow Hill."<p>The peculiarity of the position of the locative <span class= "ital">there </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">in it</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>coming before the mention of the locality itself, is illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm" title="And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.">Isaiah 8:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though ye have lien among the pots;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Will ye lie down among the sheepfolds</span>? Will ye, O ye laggarts of Israel, like the Reubenites in the war against Sisera, instead of going out to war with your brethren, "abide among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16</a>)? Yet shall ye be as <span class="cmt_word">the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold</span>. It is certainly wrong to supply, yet shall ye be before as the wings of a dove." There can be no promise of good made to these laggarts. Probably the meaning is, "Will ye be," or "Will ye seek to be as the wings of a dove, covered with silver, and her feathers of yellow gold?" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Will ye abide in your prosperity and your riches, decked in gorgeous apparel, resplendent with silver and gold, while your brethren are bearing the brunt of battle, with all its ghastly sights and sounds, in your and the land's defence? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>68:7-14 Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies. If God bring his people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be as the wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold. Full salvation will render those white as snow, who were vile and loathsome through the guilt and defilement of sin.</body></html>
