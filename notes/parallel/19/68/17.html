Its literal reading is, <span class= "ital">God's chariots, two myriads of thousands, and again myriads of thousands </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">of repetition</span>)<span class= "ital">, the Lord among them, Sinai in holiness; </span>which, by strict rule, must mean: "God's chariots are innumerable, and the Lord rides in them to Sinai, into the holy place." But this rendering is quite against the whole tenor of the passage, which is descriptive of a march <span class= "ital">from</span>, not <span class= "ital">to, </span>Sinai. Hence some suggest the rendering, "The Lord is among them--a Sinai in holiness," meaning that Zion has become <span class= "ital">Sinai, </span>a common enough figure in poetry (comp. <span class= "ital">In medio Tibure Sardinia est</span>--Mart. 4:60), but only discovered here by a roundabout process. There can hardly be a question as to the propriety of the emendation suggested by Dr. Perowne, <span class= "ital">The Lord is with them; He has come from Sinai into the holy place. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm" title="My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain on the tender herb, and as the showers on the grass:">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>, which was undoubtedly in the poet's mind.)<p><span class= "bld">Of</span> <span class= "bld">angels.</span>--This rendering arose from a confusion of the word which means <span class= "ital">repetition </span>with a word which means <span class= "ital">shining. </span>LXX., "of flourishing ones"; Vulg., "of rejoicing ones." But the mistake is a happy one, and Milton's sonorous lines have well caught the feeling and music of the Hebrew:--<p>"About His chariots numberless were poured<p>Cherub and seraph, potentates and thrones,<p>And virtues, winged spirits and chariots winged,<p>From the armoury of God, where stand of old<p>Myriads." <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost, </span>vii. 196.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels.</span> Another abrupt transition. The psalmist sees God move from Sinai, where he had represented him as present in ver. 8, into the sanctuary of Mount Zion. He is, of course, accompanied by his angelic host. This is described as a host of chariots (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>) -twenty thousand in number, and "thousands of repetition" - or thousands multiplied by thousands, as Hengstenberg understands the phrase (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">is among them;</span> or, "in their midst." <span class="cmt_word">As in Sinai, in the holy place;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Sinai is in the sanctuary</span>. The glories of Sinai are, as it were, transferred thither. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>68:15-21 The ascension of Christ must here be meant, and thereto it is applied, Eph 4:8. He received as the purchase of his death, the gifts needful for the conversion of sinners, and the salvation of believers. These he continually bestows, even on rebellious men, that the Lord God might dwell among them, as their Friend and Father. He gave gifts to men. Having received power to give eternal life, the Lord Jesus bestows it on as many as were given him, Joh 17:2. Christ came to a rebellious world, not to condemn it, but that through him it might be saved. The glory of Zion's King is, that he is a Saviour and Benefactor to all his willing people, and a consuming fire to all that persist in rebellion against him. So many, so weighty are the gifts of God's bounty, that he may be truly said to load us with them. He will not put us off with present things for a portion, but will be the God of our salvation. The Lord Jesus has authority and power to rescue his people from the dominion of death, by taking away the sting of it from them when they die, and giving them complete victory over it when they rise again. The crown of the head, the chief pride and glory of the enemy, shall be smitten; Christ shall crush the head of the serpent.</body></html>
