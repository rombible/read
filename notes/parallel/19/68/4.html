The poet's voice is the herald's who precedes the army of God to order the removal of all obstructions, and the formation of cairns to mark the road. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-14.htm" title="And shall say, Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people.">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-10.htm" title="Go through, go through the gates; prepare you the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.">Isaiah 62:10</a>, are passages alluding to the same custom.<p>The translation, "upon the heavens," rests on a rabbinical interpretation of <span class= "ital">'araboth.</span><p>By derivation it means "a dry sandy region," a "steppe."

The plural often designates particular parts of this region, as the plains of Moab or Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-4.htm" title="And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.">2Kings 25:4-5</a>). Such a restricted sense is quite in keeping with the allusions to the early history which make up so much of the psalm.<p><span class= "bld">By his name JAH.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">his name is Jah. </span>This abbreviated form of Jehovah is first found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm" title="The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.">Exodus 15:2</a>. No doubt the verse is a fragment of a song as old as the Exodus.<p>It may be noticed here that the dependence of this psalm on older songs is nowhere more conspicuous than in the very various use of the Divine names, <span class= "ital">Elohim, Adonai, El, Shaddai, Jehovah, Jah.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing unto God, sing praises to his Name</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-4.htm">Psalm 64:4</a>): <span class="cmt_word">extol him that rideth upon the heavens.</span> This passage is now generally translated, <span class="accented">Cast up</span> a <span class="accented">highway for him that rideth through the deserts</span> (Hengstenberg, Kay, Dean Johnson, Professor Cheyne, Revised Version). The image is that of a king travelling through a waste, for whom a way was made beforehand (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By his name Jah;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Jah is his Name</span>. "Jah" - the shortened form of "Jehovah" - occurs first in the Song of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>). It is repeated here in ver. 18, and recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>. Dr. Kay suggests that "it represents the <span class="accented">concentration</span> of God's redeeming power and love." <span class="cmt_word">And rejoice before him</span> (comp. ver. 3). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>68:1-6 None ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. God is the joy of his people, then let them rejoice when they come before him. He who derives his being from none, but gives being to all, is engaged by promise and covenant to bless his people. He is to be praised as a God of mercy and tender compassion. He ever careth for the afflicted and oppressed: repenting sinners, who are helpless and exposed more than any fatherless children, are admitted into his family, and share all their blessings.</body></html>
