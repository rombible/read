If the interposition has been one of a striking and unusual character, if the relief has been great, the deliverance signal, the triumph accorded to his people extraordinary, then he "goes up with a shout" - amid the exulting cries and loud jubilations of rescued Israel. When the occasion is such as to call for a public manifestation of thanksgiving at the house of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-28.htm">2 Chronicles 20:28</a>), then he "goes up" also "with the sound of the trumpet," which was always sounded by the priests on great occasions of festal joy and gladness (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-42.htm">1 Chronicles 16:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-27.htm">2 Chronicles 29:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/47.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>47:5-9 Praise is a duty in which we ought to be frequent and abundant. But here is a needful rule; Sing ye praises with understanding. As those that understand why and for what reasons they praise God, and what is the meaning of the service. It is not an acceptable service, if it is not a reasonable service. We are never to forget the end of Messiah's exaltation, so continually do the prophets dwell upon the conversion of the nations to the gospel of Christ. Why do we vainly fancy that we belong to him, unless the Spirit reign in our hearts by faith? Lord, is it not thy glory and delight to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins, now that thou art exalted as a Prince and a Saviour? Set up thy kingdom in our hearts. Bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. And so sweetly constrain all the powers and faculties of the souls of thy redeemed, into holy love, fear, and delight in thee, that praise with the understanding may rise from every heart, both here and for ever, to Thee, our God.</body></html>
