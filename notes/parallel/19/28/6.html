Others regard the psalm as composed by the union of two distinct pieces. Others again treat <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-6.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplications.">Psalm 28:6</a> as an interpolation.

The cause of the change would seem to have been a confident assurance, arising out of the very act of prayer, that the prayer is heard and granted, so that the happy results prayed for are certain to follow. Such an assurance is certainly not attained by all those whose supplications are earnest and devout; but David appears to have enjoyed it not infrequently (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications</span> (comp. ver. 2, with which this is, of set purpose, made exactly to correspond). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:6-9 Has God heard our supplications? Let us then bless his name. The Lord is my strength, to support me, and carry me on through all my services and sufferings. The heart that truly believes, shall in due time greatly rejoice: we are to expect joy and peace in believing. God shall have the praise of it: thus must we express our gratitude. The saints rejoice in others' comfort as well as their own: we have the less benefit from the light of the sun, nor from the light of God's countenance, for others' sharing therein. The psalmist concludes with a short, but comprehensive prayer. God's people are his inheritance, and precious in his eyes. He prays that God would save them; that he would bless them with all good, especially the plenty of his ordinances, which are food to the soul. And direct their actions and overrule their affairs for good. Also, lift them up for ever; not only those of that age, but his people in every age to come; lift them up as high as heaven. There, and there only, will saints be lifted up for ever, never more to sink, or be depressed. Save us, Lord Jesus, from our sins; bless us, thou Son of Abraham, with the blessing of righteousness; feed us, thou good Shepherd of the sheep, and lift us up for ever from the dust, O thou, who art the Resurrection and the Life.</body></html>
