A general notice of the imprecations of the Psalms will be found in the General Introduction (VI.). Here it is enough to remark that there is no indication of personal animosity or vindictiveness. The poet, even if expressing his own feelings, was identified with devout Israel, to whom it was natural not only to expect from Jehovah the manifestation of judgment which could alone remove the conditions that were so unfavourable to the true religion, but also to pray that He would at the same time vindicate Himself and justify those faithful to Him. (Comp. for the general thought <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/3-8.htm" title="For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.">Isaiah 3:8-11</a>.) In the actual course of God's providence, the retribution is often very accurately apportioned to the evil deed, and the Bible contains many strong instances--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>that of Adonibezek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-5.htm" title="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Judges 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm" title="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.">Judges 1:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours</span>. The feeling of righteous indignation, naturally implanted in us, causes us to desire the punishment of the wicked, quite apart from any wrong that they may have done to ourselves (Aristotle, 'Rhet.,' 2:1, &sect; 3). Give them after the work of their hands: <span class="cmt_word">render to them their desert</span>. Nothing satisfies our moral feelings but <span class="accented">exact</span> retribution - <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. David shows in both respects a moral nature uncorrupted by contact with the world of his day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-5 David is very earnest in prayer. Observe his faith in prayer; God is my rock, on whom I build my hope. Believers should not rest till they have received some token that their prayers are heard. He prays that he may not be numbered with the wicked. Save me from being entangled in the snares they have laid for me. Save me from being infected with their sins, and from doing as they do. Lord, never leave me to use such arts of deceit and treachery for my safety, as they use for my ruin. Believers dread the way of sinners; the best are sensible of the danger they are in of being drawn aside: we should all pray earnestly to God for his grace to keep us. Those who are careful not to partake with sinners in their sins, have reason to hope that they shall not receive their plagues. He speaks of the just judgments of the Lord on the workers of iniquity, ver. 4. This is not the language of passion or revenge. It is a prophecy that there will certainly come a day, when God will punish every man who persists in his evil deeds. Sinners shall be reckoned with, not only for the mischief they have done, but for the mischief they designed, and did what they could to effect. Disregard of the works of the Lord, is the cause of the sin of sinners, and becomes the cause of their ruin.</body></html>
