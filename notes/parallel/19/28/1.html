Thus Tyre (or Ts-r) is built on a broad shelf of rock. We see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/32-30.htm" title="How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?">Deuteronomy 32:30-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-2.htm" title="There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.">1Samuel 2:2</a>, that "rock" was a common metaphor for a tutelary deity, and it is adopted frequently for Jehovah in the Psalms and poetical books. Sometimes in the Authorised Version it is rendered "strong" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm" title="Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?">Psalm 60:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-3.htm" title="Be you my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: you have given commandment to save me; for you are my rock and my fortress.">Psalm 71:3</a>; see margin). The LXX. (followed by Vulg.) here, as generally, apparently through timidity, suppresses the metaphor, and renders "my God." In the song of Moses in Deuteronomy, the metaphor occurs nine times, and Stanley thinks it was derived from the granite peaks of Sinai (<span class= "ital">Jewish Church, </span>p. 195).<p><span class= "bld">Be not silent to me.</span>--Vulg. and margin, rightly, "from me." The word rendered "silent" appears, like <span class= "greekheb">????? </span>in Greek, to have the double meaning of deaf and dumb, and is apparently from an analogous derivation. (See Gesenius, <span class= "ital">Lex., sub voce.</span>) Hence we might render, "turn not a deaf ear to me," or "turn not from me in silence."<p><span class= "bld">Them that go down into the pit</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., the dead, </span>or <span class= "ital">those just about to die </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm" title="O LORD, you have brought up my soul from the grave: you have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.">Psalm 30:3</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-4.htm" title="I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that has no strength:">Psalm 88:4</a>, the expression is parallel to "My life draweth nigh unto the grave;" pit (<span class= "ital">bor</span>) is either the sepulchre (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm" title="But you are cast out of your grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.">Isaiah 14:19</a>), or the world of the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-4.htm" title="I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that has no strength:">Psalm 88:4</a>). The two significations pass one into the other. This expression suggests that the psalmist was on a bed of sickness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my Rock; be not silent</span> <span class="cmt_word">to me;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">to thee</span>, <span class="accented">O Lord</span>, <span class="accented">will I call</span>; <span class="accented">my Rock</span>, <span class="accented">be not thou deaf unto me<span class="cmt_word">.</span> "</span>My Rock" belongs to the second clause. It is with David, in these early psalms, an <span class="accented">epitheton usilatum</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-3.htm">Psalm 40:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-2.htm">Psalm 61:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, etc.). The Hebrew term used is sometimes <span class="accented">taut</span>, sometimes <span class="accented">sela</span>, which call to our minds the two great rook-fortresses of Tyre and Petra. <span class="cmt_word">Lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without hope, desperate. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-5 David is very earnest in prayer. Observe his faith in prayer; God is my rock, on whom I build my hope. Believers should not rest till they have received some token that their prayers are heard. He prays that he may not be numbered with the wicked. Save me from being entangled in the snares they have laid for me. Save me from being infected with their sins, and from doing as they do. Lord, never leave me to use such arts of deceit and treachery for my safety, as they use for my ruin. Believers dread the way of sinners; the best are sensible of the danger they are in of being drawn aside: we should all pray earnestly to God for his grace to keep us. Those who are careful not to partake with sinners in their sins, have reason to hope that they shall not receive their plagues. He speaks of the just judgments of the Lord on the workers of iniquity, ver. 4. This is not the language of passion or revenge. It is a prophecy that there will certainly come a day, when God will punish every man who persists in his evil deeds. Sinners shall be reckoned with, not only for the mischief they have done, but for the mischief they designed, and did what they could to effect. Disregard of the works of the Lord, is the cause of the sin of sinners, and becomes the cause of their ruin.</body></html>
