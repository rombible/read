For the good man the darkest night of trouble and sorrow will have a dawn of hope.<p><span class= "bld">He is gracious . . .</span>--The Authorised Version is right in making this a description of the upright man's character. The construction certainly at first appears strange, since "the upright" is in the plural, while the epithets in this clause resume the singular of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-3.htm" title="Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endures for ever.">Psalm 112:3</a>. This may be best explained by treating the first clause of this verse as a familiar proverbial saying, which the poet introduces, as a quotation, without changing the number to suit his own construction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/112.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness</span>. God's Word is "a lantern unto their feet, and a light unto their paths" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>) - sufficient under most circumstances to guide their steps aright. When this is not enough, he vouchsafes an inward light to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous</span>. It is a very forced interpretation to understand this as said of Jehovah. The entire subject of the psalm is the righteous, God-like <span class="accented">man</span>. In him are reflected shadows of all the Divine qualities. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/112.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>112:1-10 The blessedness of the righteous. - We have to praise the Lord that there are a people in the world, who fear him and serve him, and that they are a happy people; which is owing entirely to his grace. Their fear is not that which love casts out, but that which love brings in. It follows and flows from love. It is a fear to offend. This is both fear and trust. The heart touched by the Spirit of God, as the needle touched with the loadstone, turns direct and speedily to God, yet still with trembling, being filled with this holy fear. Blessings are laid up for the faithful and their children's children; and true riches are bestowed on them, with as much of this world's possessions as is profitable for them. In the darkest hours of affliction and trial, the light of hope and peace will spring up within them, and seasonable relief shall turn mourning into joy. From their Lord's example they learn to be kind and full of compassion, as well as just in all their dealings; they use discretion, that they may be liberal in that manner which appears most likely to do good. Envy and slander may for a time hide their true characters here, but they shall be had in everlasting remembrance. They need not fear evil tidings. A good man shall have a settled spirit. And it is the endeavour of true believers to keep their minds stayed upon God, and so to keep them calm and undisturbed; and God has promised them both cause to do so, and grace to do so. Trusting in the Lord is the best and surest way of establishing the heart. The heart of man cannot fix any where with satisfaction, but in the truth of God, and there it finds firm footing. And those whose hearts are established by faith, will patiently wait till they gain their point. Compare all this with the vexation of sinners. The happiness of the saints is the envy of the wicked. The desire of the wicked shall perish; their desire was wholly to the world and the flesh, therefore when these perish, their joy is gone. But the blessings of the gospel are spiritual and eternal, and are conferred upon the members of the Christian church, through Christ their Head, who is the Pattern of all righteousness, and the Giver of all grace.</body></html>
