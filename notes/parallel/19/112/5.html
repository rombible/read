Others, "he will sustain his affairs by justice." The verb primarily means "to measure," but in the conjugation here used has the sense of "sustains." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-11.htm" title="And there will I nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine; lest you, and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.">Genesis 45:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-12.htm" title="And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.">Genesis 47:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm" title="And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:21</a>, where the Authorised Version has "nourish.") The meaning is confirmed by the parallelism of the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/112.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A good man showeth favor, and lendeth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">well is it with the man that showeth</span>, etc. The verse is exegetical of the latter clause of ver. 4, and shows how the righteous man's compassion works. It makes him "show favor," or "kindness," to men generally, and "lend" to those who are in necessity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-26.htm">Psalm 37:26</a>; and for the duty of lending to the needy, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-8.htm">Deuteronomy 15:8, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will guide his affairs with discretion</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">with equity</span>. Scarcely, as Professor Cheyne suggests, "in courts of justice." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/112.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>112:1-10 The blessedness of the righteous. - We have to praise the Lord that there are a people in the world, who fear him and serve him, and that they are a happy people; which is owing entirely to his grace. Their fear is not that which love casts out, but that which love brings in. It follows and flows from love. It is a fear to offend. This is both fear and trust. The heart touched by the Spirit of God, as the needle touched with the loadstone, turns direct and speedily to God, yet still with trembling, being filled with this holy fear. Blessings are laid up for the faithful and their children's children; and true riches are bestowed on them, with as much of this world's possessions as is profitable for them. In the darkest hours of affliction and trial, the light of hope and peace will spring up within them, and seasonable relief shall turn mourning into joy. From their Lord's example they learn to be kind and full of compassion, as well as just in all their dealings; they use discretion, that they may be liberal in that manner which appears most likely to do good. Envy and slander may for a time hide their true characters here, but they shall be had in everlasting remembrance. They need not fear evil tidings. A good man shall have a settled spirit. And it is the endeavour of true believers to keep their minds stayed upon God, and so to keep them calm and undisturbed; and God has promised them both cause to do so, and grace to do so. Trusting in the Lord is the best and surest way of establishing the heart. The heart of man cannot fix any where with satisfaction, but in the truth of God, and there it finds firm footing. And those whose hearts are established by faith, will patiently wait till they gain their point. Compare all this with the vexation of sinners. The happiness of the saints is the envy of the wicked. The desire of the wicked shall perish; their desire was wholly to the world and the flesh, therefore when these perish, their joy is gone. But the blessings of the gospel are spiritual and eternal, and are conferred upon the members of the Christian church, through Christ their Head, who is the Pattern of all righteousness, and the Giver of all grace.</body></html>
