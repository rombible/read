The protection and deliverance, which a man's own strength cannot give, which no host, however numerous, can afford (ver. 16), which are not to be obtained from the largest chariot or cavalry force (ver. 17), can he and will be furnished freely by God, who alone keeps souls from death, and "delivers" those who are in peril. <span class="cmt_word">And to keep them alive in famine</span>. Famine was a calamity from which Palestine often suffered (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-1.htm">Genesis 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-5.htm">Genesis 42:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-5.htm">1 Kings 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1</a>, etc.).

Their hearts, as well as their times, are all in his hand; he formed the spirit of each man within him. All the powers of the creature depend upon him, and are of no account, of no avail at all, without him. If we make God's favour sure towards us, then we need not fear whatever is against us. We are to give to him the glory of his special grace. All human devices for the salvation of our souls are vain; but the Lord's watchful eye is over those whose conscientious fear of his name proceeds from a believing hope in his mercy. In difficulties they shall be helped; in dangers they shall not receive any real damage. Those that fear God and his wrath, must hope in God and his mercy; for there is no flying from him, but by flying to him. Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us; let us always have the comfort and benefit, not according to our merits, but according to the promise which thou hast in thy word given to us, and according to the faith thou hast by thy Spirit and grace wrought in us.</body></html>
