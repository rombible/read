We cannot imagine it otherwise, for God would contradict his own nature, if he ordained by a positive law anything contrary to that rule. But still we maybe thankful that there is no such contradiction - that "the Law is holy, just, and good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And all his works are done in truth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-7.htm">Psalm 111:7, 8</a>, "The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and equity"). All God's working (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span>), all his dealings with his creatures have truth and equity and faithfulness for their basis. He can be thoroughly trusted. This is a second and very strong ground for thanksgiving. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/33.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>33:1-11 Holy joy is the heart and soul of praise, and that is here pressed upon the righteous. Thankful praise is the breath and language of holy joy. Religious songs are proper expressions of thankful praise. Every endowment we possess, should be employed with all our skill and earnestness in God's service. His promises are all wise and good. His word is right, and therefore we are only in the right when we agree with it. His works are all done in truth. He is the righteous Lord, therefore loveth righteousness. What a pity it is that this earth, which is so full of the proofs and instances of God's goodness, should be so empty of his praises; and that of the multitudes who live upon his bounty, there are so few who live to his glory! What the Lord does, he does to purpose; it stands fast. He overrules all the counsels of men, and makes them serve his counsels; even that is fulfilled, which to us is most surprising, the eternal counsel of God, nor can any thing prevent its coming to pass.</body></html>
