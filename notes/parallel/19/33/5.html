"Righteousness" is the essential principle of justice; "judgment," the carrying out of the principle in act. God loves both - a further ground for praising him. The earth is full of the goodness (or, <span class="accented">loving</span>-<span class="accented">kindness</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-64.htm">Psalm 119:64</a>).

Thankful praise is the breath and language of holy joy. Religious songs are proper expressions of thankful praise. Every endowment we possess, should be employed with all our skill and earnestness in God's service. His promises are all wise and good. His word is right, and therefore we are only in the right when we agree with it. His works are all done in truth. He is the righteous Lord, therefore loveth righteousness. What a pity it is that this earth, which is so full of the proofs and instances of God's goodness, should be so empty of his praises; and that of the multitudes who live upon his bounty, there are so few who live to his glory! What the Lord does, he does to purpose; it stands fast. He overrules all the counsels of men, and makes them serve his counsels; even that is fulfilled, which to us is most surprising, the eternal counsel of God, nor can any thing prevent its coming to pass.</body></html>
