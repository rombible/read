Another English poet sings to the stars:--<p>"'Tis to be forgiven<p>That, in our aspirations to be great,<p>Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,<p>And claim a kindred with you."<p>--BYRON: <span class= "ital">Childe Harold.</span><p>But the psalmist looks beyond the bright worlds to a higher kinship with God Himself.<p><span class= "bld">For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">thou makest him want but a little from God: i.e., </span>hast made him little less than Divine. We should read, however, instead of <span class= "ital">"for </span>thou," "<span class= "ital">and </span>thou hast made," &c. The Authorised Version follows the LXX. in a translation suggested doubtlessly by the desire to tone down an expression about the Deity that seemed too bold. That version was adopted in his quotation by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-6.htm" title="But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?">Hebrews 2:6-7</a>). (See Note in <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary.</span>) Undoubtedly the word Elohim, being used to express a class of supernatural beings, includes angels as well as the Divine being (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-13.htm" title="And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.">1Samuel 28:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-8.htm" title="In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.">Zechariah 12:8</a>). But here there is nothing in the context to suggest limitation to one part of that class.<p><span class= "bld">Crowned.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">compassed.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast made him but a little lower than God</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). There is no place in the Old Testament where <span class="accented">Elohim</span> means "angels;" and, though the LXX. so translate in the present passage, and the rendering has passed from them into the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm">Hebrews 2:7</a>), it cannot be regarded as critically correct. The psalmist, in considering how man has been favoured by God, goes back in thought to his creation, and remembers the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26, 27</a>, "Let us make man <span class="accented">in our own image</span>, <span class="accented">after our likeness</span>... So God created man <span class="accented">in his own image</span>, <span class="accented">in the image of God</span> created he him" (compare the still stronger expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>, "I have said, Ye <span class="accented">are gods"</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And hast crowned him with glory and honour</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "and, by so <span class="accented">doing</span>, by giving him a nature but a little short of the Divine, hast put on him a crown of glory such as thou hast given to no other creature." There is a point of view from which the nature of man transcends that of angels, since <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it is a direct transcript of the Divine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is the nature which the Son of God assumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm">Hebrews 2:16</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:3-9 We are to consider the heavens, that man thus may be directed to set his affections on things above. What is man, so mean a creature, that he should be thus honoured! so sinful a creature, that he should be thus favoured! Man has sovereign dominion over the inferior creatures, under God, and is appointed their lord. This refers to Christ. In Heb 2:6-8, the apostle, to prove the sovereign dominion of Christ, shows he is that Man, that Son of man, here spoken of, whom God has made to have dominion over the works of his hands. The greatest favour ever showed to the human race, and the greatest honour ever put upon human nature, were exemplified in the Lord Jesus. With good reason does the psalmist conclude as he began, Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, which has been honoured with the presence of the Redeemer, and is still enlightened by his gospel, and governed by his wisdom and power! What words can reach his praises, who has a right to our obedience as our Redeemer?</body></html>
