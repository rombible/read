but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.">1Samuel 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-19.htm" title="And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.">1Samuel 22:19</a>). The <span class= "ital">yonek, </span>or suckling, denotes an earlier stage of the nursing period (which, with Hebrew mothers, sometimes extended over three years, <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-27.htm" title="But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.">2 Maccabees 7:27</a>, and on Talmudic authority could not be less than two years) than the <span class= "ital">olel, </span>which is applied to children able to play about on the streets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-21.htm" title="For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.">Jeremiah 9:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-4.htm" title="The tongue of the sucking child sticks to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaks it to them.">Lamentations 4:4</a>). (See Dr. Ginsburg on <span class= "ital">Eastern Manners and Customs: Bible Educator, </span>i. 29.)<p><span class= "bld">Ordained strength . . .</span>--At the first glance, the LXX. translation, as quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-16.htm" title="And said to him, Hear you what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise?">Matthew 21:16</a> (see Note, <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary</span>)<span class= "ital">, "</span>Thou hast perfected praise," seems to be correct, from a comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm" title="Give to the LORD, O you mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength.">Psalm 29:1</a>, where <span class= "ital">strength </span>translates the same Hebrew word, and plainly means <span class= "ital">homage. </span>This expresses, doubtless, part of the thought of the poet, that in a child's simple and innocent wonder lies the truest worship; that God accomplishes the greatest things and reveals His glory by means of the weakest instruments--a thought which was seized upon by our Lord to condemn the want of spirituality in the scribes and Pharisees. But the context, speaking the language of war, seems to demand the primitive meaning, <span class= "ital">stronghold </span>or <span class= "ital">defence. </span>The truth which the Bible proclaims of the innate divinity of man, his essential likeness to God, is the principal subject of the poet; and in the princely heart of innocence of an unspoilt child he sees, as Wordsworth saw, its confirmation. "Trailing clouds of glory do we come, From God who is our home." Such a proof is strong even against the noisy clamour of apostate men, who rebel against the Divine government, and lay upon God the blame of their aberration from His order. "His merry babbling mouth provides a defence of the Creator against all the calumnies of the foe" (Ewald). Others think rather of the faculty of speech, and the wonder and glory of it.<p><span class= "bld">The avenger.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">him who avenges himself.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of the month of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength</span>. By "babes and sucklings" are meant young children just able to lisp God's praises, and often doing so, either through pious teaching or by a sort of natural instinct, since "Heaven lies about us in our infancy" (Wordsworth). These scarce articulate mutterings form a foundation on which the glory of God in part rests. <span class="cmt_word">Because of thine enemies</span>. To put them to shame, who, having attained to manhood, refuse to acknowledge God. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mightset still the enemy and the avenger</span>. It scarcely seems as if any single individual - either Absalom, or Ahithophel, or even Satan (Kay) - is intended. Rather the words are used generally of all those who are enemies of God, and desirous of revenging themselves upon him. The existence of such persons is well shown by Hengstenberg. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1,2 The psalmist seeks to give unto God the glory due to his name. How bright this glory shines even in this lower world! He is ours, for he made us, protects us, and takes special care of us. The birth, life, preaching, miracles, suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus are known through the world. No name is so universal, no power and influence so generally felt, as those of the Saviour of mankind. But how much brighter it shines in the upper world! We, on this earth, only hear God's excellent name, and praise that; the angels and blessed spirits above, see his glory, and praise that; yet he is exalted far above even their blessing and praise. Sometimes the grace of God appears wonderfully in young children. Sometimes the power of God brings to pass great things in his church, by very weak and unlikely instruments, that the excellency of the power might the more evidently appear to be of God, and not of man. This he does, because of his enemies, that he may put them to silence.</body></html>
