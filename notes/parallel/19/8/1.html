Better, <span class= "ital">great or exalted.</span><p><span class= "bld">Who hast set . . .</span>--The. translation of this clause is uncertain. It must be determined by the parallelism, and by the fact that the poet, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm" title="What is man, that you are mindful of him? and the son of man, that you visit him?">Psalm 8:4</a>, merely expands the thought he had before expressed. There is plainly some error in the text since it is ungrammatical. The proposed emendations vary considerably. The ancient versions also disagree. The Authorised Version may be retained, since it meets all the requirements of the context, and is etymologically correct; though, grammatically, Ewald's correction, which also agrees with the Vulg., is preferable, "Thou whose splendour is raised above the heavens." The precise thought in the poet's mind has also been the subject of contention. Some take the clause to refer to the praises raised in Jehovah's honour higher than the heavens, a thought parallel to the preceding clause; others, to the visible glory spread over the sky. Others see an antithesis. God's glory is displayed on earth in His <span class= "ital">name, </span>His <span class= "ital">real </span>glory is above the heavens. Probably only a general sense of the majesty of Him "that is higher than the highest" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-8.htm" title="If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regards; and there be higher than they.">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a>), and "whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm" title="But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?">1Kings 8:27</a>), occupied the poet's mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord our Lord</span>. In the original, <span class="accented">Jehovah Adoneynu</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Jehovah, who art our sovereign Lord and Master." As David is here the mouthpiece of humanity, praising God for mercies common to all men, he uses the plural pronoun instead of the singular one<span class="cmt_word">. How excellent is thy Name in all the earth!</span> or, "How <span class="accented">glorious</span> is thy Name!" (Kay, Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">Who hast set thy glory above the heavens</span>. It is difficult to obtain this sense from the present Hebrew text; but some corruption of the text is suspected. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1,2 The psalmist seeks to give unto God the glory due to his name. How bright this glory shines even in this lower world! He is ours, for he made us, protects us, and takes special care of us. The birth, life, preaching, miracles, suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus are known through the world. No name is so universal, no power and influence so generally felt, as those of the Saviour of mankind. But how much brighter it shines in the upper world! We, on this earth, only hear God's excellent name, and praise that; the angels and blessed spirits above, see his glory, and praise that; yet he is exalted far above even their blessing and praise. Sometimes the grace of God appears wonderfully in young children. Sometimes the power of God brings to pass great things in his church, by very weak and unlikely instruments, that the excellency of the power might the more evidently appear to be of God, and not of man. This he does, because of his enemies, that he may put them to silence.</body></html>
