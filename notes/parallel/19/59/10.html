First he begs that they may not be slain, but only "scattered abroad," so that they may remain as examples of God's vengeance for the warning of others (ver. 11). Then, forgetting this wish, he pleads for their capture and their utter destruction, without which God's glory will not be fully vindicated (vers. 12, 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The God of my mercy shall prevent me;</span> or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">God with his mercy shall prevent</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> anticipate) <span class="accented">me</span>. <span class="cmt_word">God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/59.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>59:8-17 It is our wisdom and duty, in times of danger and difficulty, to wait upon God; for he is our defence, in whom we shall be safe. It is very comfortable to us, in prayer, to look to God as the God of our mercy, the Author of all good in us, and the Giver of all good to us. The wicked can never be satisfied, which is the greatest misery in a poor condition. A contented man, if he has not what he would have, yet he does not quarrel with Providence, nor fret within himself. It is not poverty, but discontent that makes a man unhappy. David would praise God because he had many times, and all along, found Him his refuge in the day of trouble. He that is all this to us, is certainly worthy of our best affections, praises, and services. The trials of his people will end in joy and praise. When the night of affliction is over, they will sing of the Lord's power and mercy in the morning. Let believers now, in assured faith and hope, praise Him for those mercies, for which they will rejoice and praise him for ever.</body></html>
