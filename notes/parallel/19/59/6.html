Down below me at Tophane; over about Stamboul; far away at Scutari; the whole 60,000 dogs that are said to overrun Constantinople appeared engaged in the most active extermination of each other without a moment's cessation. The yelping, howling, barking, growling, and snarling were all merged into one uniform and continuous even sound" (Albert Smith, <span class= "ital">A Month at Constantinople, </span>quoted from Spurgeon's <span class= "ital">Treasury of David</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/59.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - "Here a new stanza begins" (Cheyne). The "enemies" of ver. 1 and the "workers of iniquity" of ver. 2 are more elaborately portrayed. First they are represented as "dogs" - such hideous, half-wild dogs as frequent Eastern cities, which sleep during the greater part of the day, and rove about in packs at night - unclean, horrid, loathsome animals (ver. 6). Then they appear as men - abusive, slanderous, godless (ver. 7). In conclusion, appeal is made to God against them. He will "laugh them to scorn" (ver. 8); and he is a sure Defence against all their efforts (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They return at evening.</span> Having traced David to his house, they disperse for a time, but "return" again at evening, and take up their watch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They make a noise like a dog;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> snarl and growl, quarrelling more or less among themselves during the night time. <span class="cmt_word">And go round about the city.</span> Either wander vaguely about, as dogs do for prey, or patrol the walls and gates to see that David does not quit the city, and so escape them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/59.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>59:1-7 In these words we hear the voice of David when a prisoner in his own house; the voice of Christ when surrounded by his merciless enemies; the voice of the church when under bondage in the world; and the voice of the Christian when under temptation, affliction, and persecution. And thus earnestly should we pray daily, to be defended and delivered from our spiritual enemies, the temptations of Satan, and the corruptions of our own hearts. We should fear suffering as evil-doers, but not be ashamed of the hatred of workers of iniquity. It is not strange, if those regard not what they themselves say, who have made themselves believe that God regards not what they say. And where there is no fear of God, there is nothing to secure proper regard to man.</body></html>
