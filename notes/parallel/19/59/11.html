Timon, in the play, is made to say--<p>"Live loath'd and long<p>You smiling smooth detested parasites,"<p>that the ruin of Athens might be complete, if deferred. National feeling, too, has often insisted on extreme modes of punishment, partly from vindictive feeling, partly for deterrent purposes. Witness the sequel to the Indian mutiny. But where is the parallel to the feeling that seems uppermost in the Psalmist's mind, viz., a wish for protracted retribution on the nations for the moral benefit of Israel?<p><span class= "bld">Scatter them.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">make them wander</span>: a word applied to Cain and to the Israelite wanderings in the wilderness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/59.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Slay them not, lest my people forget;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my <span class="accented">true</span> people - <span class="accented">faithful</span> Israel. The psalmist's "first thought is, that by lingering on in life for a while the wicked may be more edifying monuments of the Divine anger" (Cheyne). (For a parallel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Scatter them by thy power;</span> or, <span class="accented">make them wanderers</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12, 14</a>).

It is very comfortable to us, in prayer, to look to God as the God of our mercy, the Author of all good in us, and the Giver of all good to us. The wicked can never be satisfied, which is the greatest misery in a poor condition. A contented man, if he has not what he would have, yet he does not quarrel with Providence, nor fret within himself. It is not poverty, but discontent that makes a man unhappy. David would praise God because he had many times, and all along, found Him his refuge in the day of trouble. He that is all this to us, is certainly worthy of our best affections, praises, and services. The trials of his people will end in joy and praise. When the night of affliction is over, they will sing of the Lord's power and mercy in the morning. Let believers now, in assured faith and hope, praise Him for those mercies, for which they will rejoice and praise him for ever.</body></html>
