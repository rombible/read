As in the preceding images, it must convey the idea of abortive effort and sudden ruin, and, as has generally been understood, some experience of eastern travel undoubtedly supplied the figure which accident or a copyist's error has rendered so obscure. The Hebrew literally runs, <span class= "ital">Before </span>(<span class= "ital">shall</span>)<span class= "ital"> understand your pots a bramble as </span>(or <span class= "ital">so</span>)<span class= "ital"> living as </span>(or <span class= "ital">so</span>)<span class= "ital"> heat sweeps them off. </span>The ancient versions mostly render <span class= "ital">thorns </span>instead of <span class= "ital">pots, </span>and make the simile to lie in the destruction of the bush before growing to maturity. The English versions have undoubtedly caught the figure more correctly. But it is doubtful if the Hebrew word rendered <span class= "ital">feel </span>could be used of inanimate objects, and even if a kettle might be said to <span class= "ital">feel the fire, </span>we should hardly speak of its <span class= "ital">feeling </span>the <span class= "ital">fuel. </span>Some change in the text must be made. A very slight change in one letter gives excellent sense to the first clause. <span class= "ital">Before thorns </span>(taking the word <span class= "ital">?tad </span>which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/9-14.htm" title="Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you, and reign over us.">Judges 9:14-15</a> is translated <span class= "ital">bramble </span>collectively) <span class= "ital">make your pots ready. </span>But the second clause remains very difficult. Even if (with Gratz) we read <span class= "ital">charol </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm" title="Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.">Job 30:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-31.htm" title="And, see, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.">Proverbs 24:31</a>, "nettles") for <span class= "ital">charon, </span>and render <span class= "ital">thorny bush, </span>the words <span class= "ital">as living </span>still offer a puzzle. And even if with the Prayer Book we might render <span class= "ital">raw </span>instead of <span class= "ital">living, </span>yet <span class= "ital">burning heat </span>could not stand for <span class= "ital">cooked meat. </span>Apparently the poet intends to compare the sudden overthrow of the wicked before their arms could succeed, to the disappearance of the fuel before it had time to heat the cooking-pot; and it is quite possible that he compressed all this into a condensed expression, which we must expand: "As, before the brambles make the pots ready, they are consumed, so He will whirl them (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the wicked) away alive, as the fierce heat consumes the thorns." Hebrew poetry is always more satisfactory with metaphor than with simile, and here, as often, seems to falter between the two, and so becomes obscure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/58.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.</span> This "difficult and obscure verse" has been variously explained. Professor Cheyne translates, "Before your pots can feel the thorns, and while your flesh (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the flesh in the pots, on which you are about to feast) is still raw, the hot wrath of Jehovah shall sweep it away." The Revised Version gives the following: "Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the thorns] away with a whirlwind, the green [thorns] and the burning alike." Dr. Kay, "Before your caldrons have felt the thorn fire, even as raw flesh, even so, shall hot fury sweep him away." The general meaning seems to be that before the wicked judges can enjoy the fruits of their wickedness, the fierce wrath of God will come upon them like a tempest, and sweep both them and the produce of their villainy away (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-6.htm">2 Samuel 23:6, 7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/58.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>58:6-11 David prayed that the enemies of God's church and people might be disabled to do further mischief. We may, in faith, pray against the designs of the enemies of the church. He foretells their ruin. And who knows the power of God's anger? The victories of the Just One, in his own person and that of his servants, over the enemies of man's salvation, produce a joy which springs not from revenge, but from a view of the Divine mercy, justice, and truth, shown in the redemption of the elect, the punishment of the ungodly, and the fulfilment of the promises. Whoever duly considers these things, will diligently seek the reward of righteousness, and adore the Providence which orders all thing aright in heaven and in earth.</body></html>
