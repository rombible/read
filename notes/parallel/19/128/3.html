This is no more out of keeping with the figure of the <span class= "ital">vine </span>than the table is with that of olive plants. Though the Hebrews had not yet developed the fatal habit of secluding their women, as later Orientals have done, still there was a strict custom which allotted a more private tent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-9.htm" title="And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.">Genesis 18:9</a>) or part of a house to them. And doubtless we are here also to think of the good housewife who is engaged within at the household duties, and is not like the idle gossip, sitting "at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-14.htm" title="For she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,">Proverbs 9:14</a>). The <span class= "ital">vine </span>and <span class= "ital">olive </span>are in Hebrew poetry frequent symbols of fruitfulness and of a happy, flourishing state. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm" title="But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.">Psalm 52:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm" title="The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.">Jeremiah 11:16</a>.) The comparison of children to the healthy young shoots of a tree is, of course, common to all poetry, being indeed latent in such expressions as "scion of a noble house." (Comp. Euripides, <span class= "ital">Medea </span>1,098: "a sweet young shoot of children.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/128.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides</span> (rather, <span class="accented">in the inner chambers</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of thine house</span>. The second point of blessedness is a fruitful wife, content to dwell in the female apartments of the house, to keep at home (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>) and guide the household. <span class="cmt_word">Thy children like olive plants</span>; or, "olive shoots" - the vigorous offsets from an aged olive tree, which spring up around it, ready to take its place. <span class="cmt_word">Round about thy table</span>. Clustering around thy board, at once a source of cheerfulness and strength (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>). This is the third point of blessedness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/128.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>128:1-6 The blessings of those who fear God. - Only those who are truly holy, are truly happy. In vain do we pretend to be of those that fear God, if we do not make conscience of keeping stedfastly to his ways. Blessed is every one that fears the Lord; whether he be high or low, rich or poor in the world. If thou fear him and walk in his ways, all shall be well with thee while thou livest, better when thou diest, best of all in eternity. By the blessing of God, the godly shall get an honest livelihood. Here is a double promise; they shall have something to do, for an idle life is a miserable, uncomfortable life, and shall have health and strength, and power of mind to do it. They shall not be forced to live upon the labours of other people. It is as much a mercy as a duty, with quietness to work and eat our own bread. They and theirs shall enjoy what they get. Such as fear the Lord and walk in his ways, are the only happy persons, whatever their station in life may be. They shall have abundant comfort in their family relations. And they shall have all the good things God has promised, and which they pray for. A good man can have little comfort in seeing his children's children, unless he sees peace upon Israel. Every true believer rejoices in the prosperity of the church. Hereafter we shall see greater things, with the everlasting peace and rest that remain for the Israel of God.</body></html>
