I</span>.--The especial difficulty of this psalm, its abrupt changes of person, meets us at the outset. The text literally rendered, runs: "<span class= "ital">He sitting in the hiding place of the Most High; In the shadow of the Almighty he lodgeth, I say to Jehovah, My refuge and my fortress, My God, I trust in Him. </span>The change in the last clause presents no particular difficulty, as many similar instances occur; but that from the <span class= "ital">third </span>person, in the first verse, to the <span class= "ital">first, </span>in the second, is very awkward, and many shifts have been adopted to get out of it. The best is to supply the word <span class= "ital">blessed: "</span>Blessed is he that," &c<span class= "note">[16]</span> The different names for God employed here should be noticed. By their accumulation the poet makes the sum of assurance doubly sure.<p><span class= "note">[16] The omission of this word by a copyist would be very natural, from its confusion with the numerical heading of the psalm and the initial letter of the word that now begins it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/91.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>). He who has his thoughts always on God is said to "dwell in him" - to "make his abode with him" - to "sit down in his secret place." He has the Almighty, as it were, for his constant companion. <span class="cmt_word">Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</span> This is not "tautology." What is meant is that "loving faith on man's part shall be met by faithful love on God's part" (Kay). God will extend his "shadow" over the man who places himself under his protection. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/91.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>91:1-8 He that by faith chooses God for his protector, shall find all in him that he needs or can desire. And those who have found the comfort of making the Lord their refuge, cannot but desire that others may do so. The spiritual life is protected by Divine grace from the temptations of Satan, which are as the snares of the fowler, and from the contagion of sin, which is a noisome pestilence. Great security is promised to believers in the midst of danger. Wisdom shall keep them from being afraid without cause, and faith shall keep them from being unduly afraid. Whatever is done, our heavenly Father's will is done; and we have no reason to fear. God's people shall see, not only God's promises fulfilled, but his threatenings. Then let sinners come unto the Lord upon his mercy-seat, through the Redeemer's name; and encourage others to trust in him also.</body></html>
