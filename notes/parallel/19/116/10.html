Mr. Burgess has certainly given the true explanation of the use of this particle. It sometimes <span class= "ital">follows</span> instead of <span class= "ital">preceding </span>the verb affected by it. We must render, <span class= "ital">It is because I believed that I spoke </span>(of God's graciousness, &c.). What follows then comes in as an antithesis. <span class= "ital">I was in great trouble; I said in my pain, "All men are untrustworthy </span>or <span class= "ital">deceitful" </span>Or (LXX.), <span class= "ital">In an ecstasy of despair I said</span>, "<span class= "ital">The whole race of mankind is a delusion</span>." The meaning of the whole passage may be thus put: It is through trust in God that I thus speak (as above--viz., of God being glorious and righteous, and of His preserving the souls of the simple). It was not always so. Once in distrust I thought that God did not care for man, and that the whole of humanity was a failure. The word <span class= "ital">ch?phez, </span>rendered in Authorised Version <span class= "ital">haste, </span>more properly <span class= "ital">alarm, </span>is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-23.htm" title="Behold, he drinks up a river, and hastens not: he trusts that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.">Job 40:23</a> contrasted with <span class= "ital">trust, </span>as it is here with <span class= "ital">faith. </span>For the sense <span class= "ital">failure </span>or <span class= "ital">vanity </span>for the word rendered in Authorised Version <span class= "ital">liars, </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-11.htm" title="And the LORD shall guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in drought, and make fat your bones: and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.">Isaiah 58:11</a> ("fail;" margin, "lie or deceive").<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/116.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - Parenthetic and obscure. Both the connection and rendering are doubtful. Professor Cheyne translates, "I was confident that I should speak thus;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. even while my affliction was going on, I felt confident that relief would come, and that I should one day speak as I have just spoken. I was, however, too sorely afflicted to give utterance to my feeling. Instead of so doing, I vented my unhappiness in abuse of my fellow-men. Thus understood, the words are an <span class="accented">apologia</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I believed, therefore have I spoken</span>. So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. But many other meanings are suggested. See the preceding paragraph. I was greatly afflicted (comp. ver. 3). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/116.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>116:10-19 When troubled, we do best to hold our peace, for we are apt to speak unadvisedly. Yet there may be true faith where there are workings of unbelief; but then faith will prevail; and being humbled for our distrust of God's word, we shall experience his faithfulness to it. What can the pardoned sinner, or what can those who have been delivered from trouble or distress, render to the Lord for his benefits? We cannot in any way profit him. Our best is unworthy of his acceptance; yet we ought to devote ourselves and all we have to his service. I will take the cup of salvation; I will offer the drink-offerings appointed by the law, in token of thankfulness to God, and rejoice in God's goodness to me. I will receive the cup of affliction; that cup, that bitter cup, which is sanctified to the saints, so that to them it is a cup of salvation; it is a means of spiritual health. The cup of consolation; I will receive the benefits God bestows upon me, as from his hand, and taste his love in them, as the portion not only of mine inheritance in the other world, but of my cup in this. Let others serve what masters they will, truly I am thy servant. Two ways men came to be servants. By birth. Lord, I was born in thy house; I am the son of thine handmaid, and therefore thine. It is a great mercy to be children of godly parents. By redemption. Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds, thou hast discharged me from them, therefore I am thy servant. The bonds thou hast loosed shall tie me faster unto thee. Doing good is sacrifice, with which God is well pleased; and this must accompany giving thanks to his name. Why should we offer that to the Lord which cost us nothing? The psalmist will pay his vows now; he will not delay the payment: publicly, not to make a boast, but to show he is not ashamed of God's service, and to invite others to join him. Such are true saints of God, in whose lives and deaths he will be glorified.</body></html>
