This, too, is the meaning of "withal," used to render the same Hebrew word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-10.htm" title="Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I with escape.">Psalm 141:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Thou, Lord, only.</span>--The authority of all the ancient Versions, including the LXX. and Vulg., is for taking the adverb with the predicate, not with the subject as in the Authorised Version: "Thou, Jehovah, makest me to dwell alone in safety." We see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-31.htm" title="Arise, get you up to the wealthy nation, that dwells without care, said the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.">Jeremiah 49:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm" title="Feed your people with your rod, the flock of your heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the middle of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.">Micah 7:14</a>, that isolation from other nations was, in the Hebrew view, a guarantee against danger. This certainly favours the view that the poem is national rather than individual.<p>For the concluding verses of the psalm Luther had a great affection, and desired Ludvig Teuffel to set them as the words of a requiem for him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>). His confidence in God enables David to lay himself down calmly and tranquilly to sleep, whatever dangers threaten him. He seeks his couch, and <span class="accented">at once</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>) slumber visits him. No anxious thoughts keep him tossing on his bed for hours<span class="cmt_word">. For thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety</span>. David has a satisfaction in thinking that it is God only who watches over him. All other help would be vain, superfluous. God alone brought Israel through the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-12.htm">Deuteronomy 32:12</a>); God alone established Israel in Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2, 3</a>). David feels that he needs no second helper and protector. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-8 Wordly people inquire for good, not for the chief good; all they want is outward good, present good, partial good, good meat, good drink, a good trade, and a good estate; but what are all these worth? Any good will serve the turn of most men, but a gracious soul will not be put off so. Lord, let us have thy favour, and let us know that we have it, we desire no more; let us be satisfied of thy loving-kindness, and will be satisfied with it. Many inquire after happiness, but David had found it. When God puts grace in the heart, he puts gladness in the heart. Thus comforted, he pitied, but neither envied nor feared the most prosperous sinner. He commits all his affairs to God, and is prepared to welcome his holy will. But salvation is in Christ alone; where will those appear who despise him as their Mediator, and revile him in his disciples? May they stand in awe, and no longer sin against the only remedy.</body></html>
