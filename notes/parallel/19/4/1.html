It is summed up in the question, "Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?" The strength of the innocent in the face of calumny or oppression lies in the appeal to the eternal source of righteousness.<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast enlarged.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in my straitness Thou </span>(or, <span class= "ital">Thou who</span>)<span class= "ital"> hast made room for me. </span>This is a thought very common in the Psalter, and apparently was a favourite phrase of David's, occurring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-19.htm" title="He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.">Psalm 18:19</a> (comp. Psa. 4:36), and in other psalms attributed to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness</span>. Not "the God who imputes to me righteousness," as some render, but "the God who sees that I and my cause are righteous," and who wilt therefore certainly lend me aid. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast enlarged me</span>; or, <span class="accented">made room for me</span> - "set me at ease" In the language of the Old Testament, "straits" and "narrowness" mean trouble and affliction; "room," "space," "enlargement," mean prosperity. David has experienced God's mercies in the past, and therefore looks for them in the future (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>). When I woe in distress; literally, in [<span class="accented">my</span>] <span class="accented">distress. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</span> This is David's usual cry, repeated in a hundred varied forms throughout the Psalms (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-7.htm">Psalm 27:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 Hear me for thy mercy-sake, is our best plea. He who will not ask such blessings as pardon, and justifying righteousness, and eternal life, must perish for the want of them. Alas! that so many should make so fearful a choice. The psalmist warns against sin. Keep up holy reverence of the glory and majesty of God. You have a great deal to say to your hearts, they may be spoken with, let it not be unsaid. Examine them by serious self-reflection; let your thoughts fasten upon that which is good, and keep close to it. Consider your ways, and before you turn to sleep at night, examine your consciences with respect to what you have done in the day; particularly what you have done amiss, that you may repent of it. when you awake in the night, meditate upon God, and the things that belong to your peace. Upon a sick-bed, particularly, we should consider our ways. Be still. when you have asked conscience a question, be serious, be silent, wait for an answer. Open not the mouth to excuse sin. All confidence must be pan answer. Open not the mouth to excuse sin. All confidence only: therefore, after commanding the sacrifices of righteousness, the psalmist says, Put your trust in the Lord.</body></html>
