Among David's adherents in his times of distress (ver. 1) would be many who doubted and desponded, anticipating nothing but continued suffering and misfortune. Theft would ask the question of the text. Or the scope may be wider. Men are always seeking for good, but not knowing what their true good is. David points it out to them. It is to have the light of God's countenance shining on them. Lord, lift thou up, etc.; compare the form of Levitical benediction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>), and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3, 7, 19</a>. If we bask in the sunshine of God's favour, there is nothing more needed for happiness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:6-8 Wordly people inquire for good, not for the chief good; all they want is outward good, present good, partial good, good meat, good drink, a good trade, and a good estate; but what are all these worth? Any good will serve the turn of most men, but a gracious soul will not be put off so. Lord, let us have thy favour, and let us know that we have it, we desire no more; let us be satisfied of thy loving-kindness, and will be satisfied with it. Many inquire after happiness, but David had found it. When God puts grace in the heart, he puts gladness in the heart. Thus comforted, he pitied, but neither envied nor feared the most prosperous sinner. He commits all his affairs to God, and is prepared to welcome his holy will. But salvation is in Christ alone; where will those appear who despise him as their Mediator, and revile him in his disciples? May they stand in awe, and no longer sin against the only remedy.</body></html>
