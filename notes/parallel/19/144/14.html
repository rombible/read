The words rendered "oxen, strong to labour," can hardly bear this meaning with the present pointing, since the participle is passive, and there is no authority for rendering <span class= "ital">oxen bearing burdens. </span>The words have been rendered <span class= "ital">oxen laden, </span>either with the produce of the land, or with their own fat (so apparently the LXX.), or with young, <span class= "ital">pregnant</span>--all open to the objection that the passive of <span class= "ital">to bear </span>must mean "to be borne," and the latter to the further objection that the words are in the masculine. But since <span class= "ital">all-phim </span>elsewhere means "heads of families" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-21.htm" title="What will you say when he shall punish you? for you have taught them to be captains, and as chief over you: shall not sorrows take you, as a woman in travail?">Jeremiah 13:21</a>, &c) or "princes," and the noun cognate with the verb is used of a post connected with the revenue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm" title="And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.">1Kings 11:28</a>; comp. the connection between the Greek <span class= "greekheb">?????</span> and <span class= "greekheb">????????</span>), the participle passive may easily here mean "honoured," or "high in office." Or, from the use of the cognate Chaldee form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-3.htm" title="In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof three score cubits, and the breadth thereof three score cubits;">Ezra 6:3</a>, "strongly laid," we might render, <span class= "ital">our princes firmly established; </span>and this is the best explanation of the passage.<p><span class= "bld">No breaking in.--</span>Heb., a "breach," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the town walls. LXX. and Vulg., "no falling of the fence." Others refer to the folds for cattle. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-2.htm" title="You have made the earth to tremble; you have broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shakes.">Psalm 60:2</a>.) Ewald, however, connecting closely with the mention of "pregnant oxen," renders <span class= "ital">no abortion. </span>So Syriac: "Our cattle are great (with young), and there is not a barren one among them."<p><span class= "bld">Nor going out</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>either to war, or into <span class= "ital">captivity </span>(Prayer Book version), or the breaking out of cattle. The first is the more probable.<p><span class= "bld">Complaining.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">outcry, cry of sorrow, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-2.htm" title="Judah mourns, and the gates thereof languish; they are black to the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.">Jeremiah 14:2</a>; or possibly, <span class= "ital">cry of battle.</span><p><span class= "bld">Streets.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">squares.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/144.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That our oxen may be strong to labor</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and our oxen are heavily laden</span>.

Here the description of a happy time ends, and a burst of congratulation follows (see the next verse). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/144.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>144:9-15 Fresh favours call for fresh returns of thanks; we must praise God for the mercies we hope for by his promise, as well as those we have received by his providence. To be saved from the hurtful sword, or from wasting sickness, without deliverance from the dominion of sin and the wrath to come, is but a small advantage. The public prosperity David desired for his people, is stated. It adds much to the comfort and happiness of parents in this world, to see their children likely to do well. To see them as plants, not as weeds, not as thorns; to see them as plants growing, not withered and blasted; to see them likely to bring forth fruit unto God in their day; to see them in their youth growing strong in the Spirit. Plenty is to be desired, that we may be thankful to God, generous to our friends, and charitable to the poor; otherwise, what profit is it to have our garners full? Also, uninterrupted peace. War brings abundance of mischiefs, whether it be to attack others or to defend ourselves. And in proportion as we do not adhere to the worship and service of God, we cease to be a happy people. The subjects of the Saviour, the Son of David, share the blessings of his authority and victories, and are happy because they have the Lord for their God.</body></html>
