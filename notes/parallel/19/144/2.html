<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-17.htm" title="To you, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defense, and the God of my mercy.">Psalm 59:17</a>). The expression is exactly analogous to the term" grace," applied to kings as the source of grace or mercy. For the other epithets, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm" title="The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.">Psalm 18:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Who subdueth.--</span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-47.htm" title="It is God that avenges me, and subdues the people under me.">Psalm 18:47</a>; but the verb is different (cognate with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-48.htm" title="It is God that avenges me, and that brings down the people under me.">2Samuel 22:48</a>), and here the singular, "my people," instead of "my peoples." Some MSS. indeed have the plural here, and the Syriac and Chaldee followed them, or changed to suit Psalms 18. If we had the historical incidents out of which the psalm sprung we might account for the change.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/144.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust</span>. The general resemblance to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> is striking, but there are peculiar and original touches which indicate the author, not the copyist. For instance, the expression, "my goodness," occurs nowhere else. <span class="cmt_word">Who subdueth my people under me.</span> Another reading gives, "Who subdueth <span class="accented">peoples</span> under me." Either reading suits the circumstances of David, who had to subdue a great portion of his own people under him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6-21</a>), and also conquered many foreign nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/144.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>144:1-8 When men become eminent for things as to which they have had few advantages, they should be more deeply sensible that God has been their Teacher. Happy those to whom the Lord gives that noblest victory, conquest and dominion over their own spirits. A prayer for further mercy is fitly begun with a thanksgiving for former mercy. There was a special power of God, inclining the people of Israel to be subject to David; it was typical of the bringing souls into subjection to the Lord Jesus. Man's days have little substance, considering how many thoughts and cares of a never-dying soul are employed about a poor dying body. Man's life is as a shadow that passes away. In their highest earthly exaltation, believers will recollect how mean, sinful, and vile they are in themselves; thus they will be preserved from self-importance and presumption. God's time to help his people is, when they are sinking, and all other helps fail.</body></html>
