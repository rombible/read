<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm" title="And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be numbered.">Genesis 13:16</a>, &c, if a finite verb instead of participles followed; or it might mean "because," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-18.htm" title="And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.">Genesis 30:18</a>, &c, but for the same anomalous construction; or it might, as by the LXX., be rendered <span class= "ital">whose, </span>if any antecedent for it could be discovered. But all these devices are plainly impossible, and there is nothing for it but to treat the passage which it introduces as a fragment of another poem quite unconnected with the previous part of the psalm. Render, <span class= "ital">we whose.</span><p><span class= "bld">As plants.</span>--The Hebrew word seems always to denote a young, vigorous tree lately planted. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-9.htm" title="Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.">Job 14:9</a>, aptly translated by the LXX. <span class= "greekheb">????????</span><span class= "ital">. </span>(For the comparison, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-7.htm" title="For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.">Isaiah 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm" title="And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.">Psalm 1:3</a>, Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-3.htm" title="Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of your house: your children like olive plants round about your table.">Psalm 128:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Grown up in their youth.--</span>The form here used is peculiar, but in another conjugation the verb is frequently used of <span class= "ital">bringing </span>up children (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-6.htm" title="Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you be mine, and if you will listen to my voice, take you the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.">2Kings 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-4.htm" title="Be you ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.">Isaiah 23:4</a>, &c.). as it is of the rain nourishing young plants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-14.htm" title="He hews him down cedars, and takes the cypress and the oak, which he strengthens for himself among the trees of the forest: he plants an ash, and the rain does nourish it.">Isaiah 44:14</a>). Here the poet must mean <span class= "ital">grown tall beyond their age, </span>or the figure is somewhat tame. A suggestion to read, "reproductive in their youth," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>though young themselves, bringing up families, improves the poetry, and suits well the intention of this fragment of song and the general feeling of the Hebrew race. Comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-4.htm" title="As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.">Psalm 127:4</a>, "sons of youth" (Burgess).<p><span class= "bld">Corner stones.</span>--The word only occurs once besides, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-15.htm" title="The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar.">Zechariah 9:15</a>, where it is used of the corners of the altar. The derivation is from a root meaning <span class= "ital">to conceal, </span>as is also the word rendered <span class= "ital">garners, </span>in the next verse. Aquila and Symmachus, "angles."<p><span class= "bld">Polished.</span>--The Hebrew word means <span class= "ital">to hew, </span>used, with one exception, of wood for fuel, but is cognate with a word used of <span class= "ital">stones, </span>and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm" title="Listen to me, you that follow after righteousness, you that seek the LORD: look to the rock from where you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you are dig.">Isaiah 51:1</a> in the passive participle of a cave hewn in a rock. The exception is <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-16.htm" title="I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.">Proverbs 7:16</a>, where the word is applied to tapestry.<p><span class= "bld">After the similitude of a palace--</span>i.e., like a large and stately building. There seems no reason to confine the reference to the Temple, as the LXX. and Vulg. do, though the absence of the article is not insuperably against this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>).<p>The explanations usually given of this passage make the resemblance to be either to caryatides carved at the angles of a palace, or to carved or variegated wood pillars in the corners of a spacious room. For the former there seems to be no authority in Scripture or known Hebrew usage. The latter has the support of Dr. J. G. Wetzstein, but seems far-fetched. It is far more according to Hebrew feeling to render the words simply, <span class= "ital">like hewn angles, the building of a palace; </span>an image suggestive, like that of "the wall" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-9.htm" title="If she be a wall, we will build on her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.">Song of Solomon 8:9</a> (see Note), of unassailable chastity and virtue. Perhaps the phrase "women of strength or of a strong fortification," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-11.htm" title="And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you all that you require: for all the city of my people does know that you are a virtuous woman.">Ruth 3:11</a>, may imply the same figure. Gratz alters to "daughters of a palace."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/144.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That our sons may be as plants</span>. The stanza which these words introduce is a very remarkable one, having nothing at all corresponding to it in the rest of the Psalter. It has been thought by some to be an antique document, quoted by the writer of the psalm, as suited for a festal occasion. Our translation makes it a picture of the condition to which the writer hopes that Israel may one day come; but the best recent critics see in it a description of Israel's actual condition in the writer's day. Professor Cheyne translates, "Because our sons <span class="accented">are</span> as plants;" and Dr. Kay, "What time our sons <span class="accented">are</span> as plants." <span class="cmt_word">Grown up in their youth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">grown large</span>. The sons are compared to ornamental trees or shrubs, growing outside a building. That our <span class="cmt_word">daughters may be as cornerstones, polished</span> (or, "carved") <span class="cmt_word">after the similitude of a palace.</span> The daughters are like carved pillars, lighting up the angular recesses of the structure. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/144.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>144:9-15 Fresh favours call for fresh returns of thanks; we must praise God for the mercies we hope for by his promise, as well as those we have received by his providence. To be saved from the hurtful sword, or from wasting sickness, without deliverance from the dominion of sin and the wrath to come, is but a small advantage. The public prosperity David desired for his people, is stated. It adds much to the comfort and happiness of parents in this world, to see their children likely to do well. To see them as plants, not as weeds, not as thorns; to see them as plants growing, not withered and blasted; to see them likely to bring forth fruit unto God in their day; to see them in their youth growing strong in the Spirit. Plenty is to be desired, that we may be thankful to God, generous to our friends, and charitable to the poor; otherwise, what profit is it to have our garners full? Also, uninterrupted peace. War brings abundance of mischiefs, whether it be to attack others or to defend ourselves. And in proportion as we do not adhere to the worship and service of God, we cease to be a happy people. The subjects of the Saviour, the Son of David, share the blessings of his authority and victories, and are happy because they have the Lord for their God.</body></html>
