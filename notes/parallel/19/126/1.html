On the other hand, the usual rendering suggests that the news of the restoration appeared too good to be true. "Surely you are dreaming" is a common saying. An illustration has been aptly produced in Livy's description of the feelings of the Greeks when they heard at the Isthmian games (B.C. 196), after the defeat of the Macedonians by T. Flaminius, the proclamation of the herald that they should, by the free gift of the Roman people, retain their liberty. "The joy was too great for men to take it all in.

And how ought redemption from the wrath to come, from the power of sin and of Satan, to be valued! The sinner convinced of his guilt and danger, when by looking to a crucified Saviour he receives peace to his conscience, and power to break off his sins, often can scarcely believe that the prospect which opens to him is a reality.</body></html>
