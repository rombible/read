The words of the prophet Haggai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/haggai/1-10.htm" title="Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.">Haggai 1:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-19.htm" title="Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.">Haggai 2:19</a>), contemporary with the Return, should be compared. The word rendered "precious" in the Authorised Version may be correctly represented by "handful." Its meaning is "drawing;" and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-13.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that sows seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.">Amos 9:13</a> (see margin) we see that the sower was called "the drawer of seed," no doubt from the hand being repeatedly drawn out for the cast from the bag or basket containing the seed. Others render "seed-basket" here. The contrast so beautifully painted in this verse was certainly realised when "the priests and Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of the house of God with joy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm" title="And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.">Ezra 6:16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-22.htm" title="And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.">Ezra 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-42.htm" title="And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.">Nehemiah 12:42</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/126.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed</span>; literally, <span class="accented">going he goes and weeping</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. weeping every step as he goes - "bearing the <span class="accented">draught</span> of seed," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the seed which he has <span class="accented">drawn</span> forth from his bag, and is about to scatter on the earth.

And while we are in this world there will be matter for prayer, even when we are most furnished with matter for praise. Suffering saints are often in tears; they share the calamities of human life, and commonly have a greater share than others. But they sow in tears; they do the duty of an afflicted state. Weeping must not hinder sowing; we must get good from times of affliction. And they that sow, in the tears of godly sorrow, to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting; and that will be a joyful harvest indeed. Blessed are those that mourn, for they shall be for ever comforted. When we mourn for our sins, or suffer for Christ's sake, we are sowing in tears, to reap in joy. And remember that God is not mocked; for whatever a man soweth that shall he reap, Ga 6:7-9. Here, O disciple of Jesus, behold an emblem of thy present labour and future reward; the day is coming when thou shalt reap in joy, plentiful shall be thy harvest, and great shall be thy joy in the Lord.</body></html>
