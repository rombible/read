The parallelism decides in favour of this.<p>Mark the honest man, and behold the upright;<p>For a posterity (shall be) to the man of peace:<p>But transgressors are altogether destroyed,<p>The posterity of the wicked is destroyed.<p>So the LXX. and Vulg.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace</span>. This translation is much disputed. Most ancients and many moderns render the first line, "Keep innocency, and observe uprightness," while some critics maintain that <span class="accented">acharith</span> in the second line must mean "posterity," and not "end." Others, again, join <span class="accented">shalom</span> to <span class="accented">ish</span>, and render, "There shall be posterity (or, a future) to the man of peace." However, the rendering of the Authorized Version is retained by our Revisers, and accepted in part by Hengstenberg and Dr. Kay, while it has the complete approval of Canon Cook. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>37:34-40 Duty is ours, and we must mind it; but events are God's, we must refer the disposal of them to him. What a striking picture is in ver. 35,36, of many a prosperous enemy of God! But God remarkably blights the projects of the prosperous wicked, especially persecutors. None are perfect in themselves, but believers are so in Christ Jesus. If all the saint's days continue dark and cloudy, his dying day may prove comfortable, and his sun set bright; or, if it should set under a cloud, yet his future state will be everlasting peace. The salvation of the righteous will be the Lord's doing. He will help them to do their duties, to bear their burdens; help them to bear their troubles well, and get good by them, and, in due time, will deliver them out of their troubles. Let sinners then depart from evil, and do good; repent of and forsake sin, and trust in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ. Let them take his yoke upon them, and learn of him, that they may dwell for evermore in heaven. Let us mark the closing scenes of different characters, and always depend on God's mercy.</body></html>
