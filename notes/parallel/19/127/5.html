(See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-43.htm" title="Whoever is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the LORD.">Psalm 107:43</a>.) Parents who have large families of sons are evidently intended. From the figure of the warrior and the arrows we should expect here, too, a martial image. They shall not be discomfited, but they shall challenge their enemies in the gates. In illustration may be quoted:<p>"Therefore men pray to have around their hearth,<p>Obedient offspring, to requite their foes<p>With harm, and honour whom their father loves;<p>But he whose issue is unprofitable,<p>Begets what else but sorrow to himself,<p>And store of laughter to his enemies?"<p><span class= "ital">SOPH.: Antig., </span>641<p>On the other hand, it is the habit of Hebrew poetry to accumulate metaphors, and the <span class= "ital">gate </span>is so commonly spoken of as the place of public resort, where legal cases were decided (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-21.htm" title="That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nothing.">Isaiah 29:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm" title="For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.">Amos 5:12</a>, &c), that it is quite as likely that the allusion here is to the support which a man's just cause would receive when evidently backed up by a long retinue of stalwart sons. This view certainly receives support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-4.htm" title="His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.">Job 5:4</a>, where we have the very opposite picture of a tyrant's sons, not only unable to support their father, but themselves "crushed in the gate;" and the phrase "speak with their enemies" in this same verse may be illustrated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-4.htm" title="And when he that does flee to one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.">Joshua 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm" title="Righteous are you, O LORD, when I plead with you: yet let me talk with you of your judgments: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they happy that deal very treacherously?">Jeremiah 12:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/127.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them</span>. Happy the man whose quiver contains many such arrows, and who is thus sure of abundant protection. <span class="cmt_word">They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate</span>; rather, when <span class="accented">they shall</span> speak (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version). "The gate" was the place where judgment was given, and where consequently adversaries were apt to meet, as they pushed their respective causes. There might be collisions on such occasions; and, in any case, a man with several lusty sons to take his part would have an advantage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/127.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>127:1-5 The value of the Divine blessing. - Let us always look to God's providence. In all the affairs and business of a family we must depend upon his blessing. 1. For raising a family. If God be not acknowledged, we have no reason to expect his blessing; and the best-laid plans fail, unless he crowns them with success. 2. For the safety of a family or a city. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchmen, though they neither slumber nor sleep, wake but in vain; mischief may break out, which even early discoveries may not be able to prevent. 3. For enriching a family. Some are so eager upon the world, that they are continually full of care, which makes their comforts bitter, and their lives a burden. All this is to get money; but all in vain, except God prosper them: while those who love the Lord, using due diligence in their lawful callings, and casting all their care upon him, have needful success, without uneasiness or vexation. Our care must be to keep ourselves in the love of God; then we may be easy, whether we have little or much of this world. But we must use the proper means very diligently. Children are God's gifts, a heritage, and a reward; and are to be accounted blessings, and not burdens: he who sends mouths, will send meat, if we trust in him. They are a great support and defence to a family. Children who are young, may be directed aright to the mark, God's glory, and the service of their generation; but when they are gone into the world, they are arrows out of the hand, it is too late to direct them then. But these arrows in the hand too often prove arrows in the heart, a grief to godly parents. Yet, if trained according to God's word, they generally prove the best defence in declining years, remembering their obligations to their parents, and taking care of them in old age. All earthly comforts are uncertain, but the Lord will assuredly comfort and bless those who serve him; and those who seek the conversion of sinners, will find that their spiritual children are their joy and crown in the day of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
