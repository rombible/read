It is, as has been observed, "confident and triumphant." The psalmist has, in the first part, shown the wickedness of the ungodly; in the second, he has prayed for vengeance on them, and for the deliverance of their victims; in the third, he expresses his certainty that his prayer is heard, and that the punishment and deliverance for which he has prayed are as good as accomplished. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is King for ever and ever</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-10.htm">Psalm 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-10.htm">Psalm 146:10</a>). Thus God's kingdom is established, his authority vindicated, his absolute rule over all men made manifest. Internal and external foes are alike overcome. The heathen - whether uncircumcised in the flesh or in the heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25, 26</a>) - are perished out of his (Jehovah's) land. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-18 The psalmist speaks with astonishment, at the wickedness of the wicked, and at the patience and forbearance of God. God prepares the heart for prayer, by kindling holy desires, and strengthening our most holy faith, fixing the thoughts, and raising the affections, and then he graciously accepts the prayer. The preparation of the heart is from the Lord, and we must seek unto him for it. Let the poor, afflicted, persecuted, or tempted believer recollect, that Satan is the prince of this world, and that he is the father of all the ungodly. The children of God cannot expect kindness, truth, or justice from such persons as crucified the Lord of glory. But this once suffering Jesus, now reigns as King over all the earth, and of his dominion there shall be no end. Let us commit ourselves unto him, humbly trusting in his mercy. He will rescue the believer from every temptation, and break the arm of every wicked oppressor, and bruise Satan under our feet shortly. But in heaven alone will all sin and temptation be shut out, though in this life the believer has a foretaste of deliverance.</body></html>
