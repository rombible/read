therefore shall no man look for his goods.">Job 20:21</a>, "nothing escaped his covetousness, therefore his prospering shall not last," and from the cognate of the verb "strength." Perhaps, however, "his ways are always strong" implies only the bold and reckless course with which a tyrant pursues his end. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-12.htm" title="Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.">Psalm 73:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thy judgments . . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a height thy judgments far above him. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Puffeth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., in scorn. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm" title="For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, said the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffs at him.">Psalm 12:5</a>.) South uses the word in this sense, "It is really to defy heaven to <span class= "ital">puff </span>at damnation, and bid omnipotence do its work." It is especially forcible after the description of the haughty attitude of the wicked, with his nose high in the air, snorting out contempt against his foes, disdaining God and man alike.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His ways are always grievous</span>; lather, <span class="accented">firm</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> steadfast and consistent, not wavering and uncertain. The thoroughly wicked person who "neither fears God nor regards man," pursues the course which he has set himself, without deviation, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left. There is nothing to hinder him - no qualm of conscience, no distrust of himself, no fear of other men's opposition<span class="cmt_word">. Thy judgments are far above out of his sight</span>. They are held in reserve; he does not foresee them - he does not believe in them. <span class="cmt_word">As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them</span>. His human adversaries he wholly despises, believing that a breath from his month will bring them to nothing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 God's withdrawings are very grievous to his people, especially in times of trouble. We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion.</body></html>
