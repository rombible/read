Not to be taken of indignation felt by the sufferers, but literally of the afflictions they endure. The Authorised Version rendering of the next clause takes the wicked as the subject of the verb; but it preserves the parallelism better, and is more in accordance with the rest of the psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/10-8.htm" title="He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places does he murder the innocent: his eyes are privately set against the poor.">Psalm 10:8-10</a>), to understand it of the "humble," the singular changing to the plural in the subject when supplied: "they (the sufferers) are taken (the verb is in the present) in the plot which they (the wicked) have devised."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor</span>. Dr. Kay translates, "Through the pride of the wicked man the poor is set on fire;" and our Revisers, "In the pride of the wicked, the poor is hotly pursued;" and so (nearly) the LXX., the Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, Kohler, Hengstenberg, and others. The Authorized Version paraphrases rather than translates; but it does not misrepresent the general sense, which is a complaint that the poor are persecuted by the wicked<span class="cmt_word">. Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>, "Let his net that he hath hid catch himself;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a>, "Let the wicked fall into their own nets;" see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a>). Some, however, translate, "They (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the poor) are ensnared in the devices which they (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wicked) have imagined;" and this is certainly a possible rendering. Hengstenberg regards it as preferable to the other "on account of the parallelism and connection." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 God's withdrawings are very grievous to his people, especially in times of trouble. We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion.</body></html>
