The idea of continuance is instinctive in the human mind. "The thing that has been, it is that which shall be" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>). We expect the sun to rise each day, solely because in the past it has always risen (see Butler's 'Analogy,' part 1. ch. 1.). The wicked man, who has always prospered, expects to prosper in the future; he has no anticipation of coming change; he supposes that his "house will continue for ever, and his dwelling-place to all generations' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>); he thinks that "to-morrow will be as to-day, and much more abundant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-12.htm">Isaiah 56:12</a>).

We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion.</body></html>
