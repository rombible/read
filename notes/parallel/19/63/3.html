"Love is the ever-springing fountain" from which all goodness proceeds, and a sense of it is even more than the happy sense of being alive. The following lines convey in a modern dress the feeling of this part of the psalm:--<p>"So gazing up in my youth at love,<p>As seen through power, ever above<p>All modes which make it manifest,<p>My soul brought all to a single test--<p>That He, the Eternal, First and Last,<p>Who in His power had so surpassed<p>All man conceives of what is might,<p>Whose wisdom too showed infinite--<p>Would prove as infinitely good."<p>R.

When this is the regular frame of a believer's mind, he values the loving-kindness of God more than life. God's loving-kindness is our spiritual life, and that is better than temporal life. We must praise God with joyful lips; we must address ourselves to the duties of religion with cheerfulness, and speak forth the praises of God from a principle of holy joy. Praising lips must be joyful lips. David was in continual danger; care and fear held his eyes waking, and gave him wearisome nights; but he comforted himself with thoughts of God. The mercies of God, when called to mind in the night watches, support the soul, making darkness cheerful. How happy will be that last morning, when the believer, awaking up after the Divine likeness, shall be satisfied with all the fulness of God, and praise him with joyful lips, where there is no night, and where sorrow and sighing flee away!</body></html>
