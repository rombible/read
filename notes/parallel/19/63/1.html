Here the land is imagined to be <span class= "ital">faint </span>for want of water. The LXX. and Vulgate have "pathless." The parched land thirsting for rain was a natural image, especially to an Oriental, for a devout religious soul eager for communion with heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/63.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O God, thou art my God;</span> or, <span class="accented">my strong God</span> (<span class="accented">Eli</span>) - my Tower of strength. <span class="cmt_word">Early will I seek thee.</span> The song was, perhaps, composed in the night watches, and poured forth at early dawn, when the king woke "refreshed" (comp. vers. 5, 6; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-14.htm">2 Samuel 16:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee;</span> or, <span class="accented">pineth for thee</span> (the verb occurs only in this place).

The true Christian devotes to God the morning hour. He opens the eyes of his understanding with those of his body, and awakes each morning to righteousness. He arises with a thirst after those comforts which the world cannot give, and has immediate recourse by prayer to the Fountain of the water of life. The true believer is convinced, that nothing in this sinful world can satisfy the wants and desires of his immortal soul; he expects his happiness from God, as his portion. When faith and hope are most in exercise, the world appears a weary desert, and the believer longs for the joys of heaven, of which he has some foretastes in the ordinances of God upon earth.</body></html>
