It was the duty of every faithful Israelite to set forth God's majesty, and to "declare his works with rejoicing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/117-2.htm">Psalm 117:2</a>). David proclaims himself ready to perform this duty.

Especially we should speak of God's wondrous work of redemption, while we declare his greatness. For no deliverance of the Israelites, nor the punishment of sinners, so clearly proclaims the justice of God, as the cross of Christ exhibits it to the enlightened mind. It may be truly said of our Lord Jesus Christ, that his words are words of goodness and grace; his works are works of goodness and grace. He is full of compassion; hence he came into the world to save sinners. When on earth, he showed his compassion both to the bodies and souls of men, by healing the one, and making wise the other. He is of great mercy, a merciful High Priest, through whom God is merciful to sinners.</body></html>
