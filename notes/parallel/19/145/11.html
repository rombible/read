The "glory" of God's kingdom is such that the faithful are naturally drawn to "speak" of it. "His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endureth throughout all ages" (ver. 13). "His kingdom <span class="accented">ruleth over all"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>) - heaven and earth, and hell, and all space, and whatever space contains.

"Power" is of the essence of kingship, and comes naturally to the front whenever the character of a kingdom is spoken of. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/145.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>145:10-21 All God's works show forth his praises. He satisfies the desire of every living thing, except the unreasonable children of men, who are satisfied with nothing. He does good to all the children of men; his own people in a special manner. Many children of God, who have been ready to fall into sin, to fall into despair, have tasted his goodness in preventing their falls, or recovering them speedily by his graces and comforts. And with respect to all that are heavy laden under the burden of sin, if they come to Christ by faith, he will ease them, he will raise them. He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of his people. He is present every where; but in a special way he is nigh to them, as he is not to others. He is in their hearts, and dwells there by faith, and they dwell in him. He is nigh to those that call upon him, to help them in all times of need. He will be nigh to them, that they may have what they ask, and find what they seek, if they call upon him in truth and sincerity. And having taught men to love his name and holy ways, he will save them from the destruction of the wicked. May we then love his name, and walk in his ways, while we desire that all flesh should bless his holy name for ever and ever.</body></html>
