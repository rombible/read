There can, therefore, be little doubt that, as Dean Stanley observed, this image was furnished by the windings and rapids of the Jordan, each hurrying to dash itself with yet fiercer vehemence of sounding water over some opposing ledge of rocks "in cataract after cataract to the sea." Thus every step taken on that sorrowful journey offered an emblem of the griefs accumulating on the exile's heart. The word rendered waterspout only occurs besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-8.htm" title="And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.

The image is common in all poetry. (Comp. "And as a sea of ills urges on its waves; one falling, another, with huge (literally, <span class= "ital">third</span>) crest, rising."--'sch., <span class= "ital">Seven against Thebes, </span>759.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Deep calleth unto deep at</span> <span class="cmt_word">the noise of thy waterspouts.</span> Blow follows blow. Misfortunes "come not in single file, but in battalions." The imagery may be taken from the local storms that visit the Trans-Jordanic territory (see Lynch, 'Expedition to the Jordan and the Dead Sea;' and Wilson, 'Negeb,' pp. 26, 27). <span class="cmt_word">All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-7.htm">Psalm 88:7, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/42.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>42:6-11 The way to forget our miseries, is to remember the God of our mercies. David saw troubles coming from God's wrath, and that discouraged him. But if one trouble follow hard after another, if all seem to combine for our ruin, let us remember they are all appointed and overruled by the Lord. David regards the Divine favour as the fountain of all the good he looked for. In the Saviour's name let us hope and pray. One word from him will calm every storm, and turn midnight darkness into the light of noon, the bitterest complaints into joyful praises. Our believing expectation of mercy must quicken our prayers for it. At length, is faith came off conqueror, by encouraging him to trust in the name of the Lord, and to stay himself upon his God. He adds, And my God; this thought enabled him to triumph over all his griefs and fears. Let us never think that the God of our life, and the Rock of our salvation, has forgotten us, if we have made his mercy, truth, and power, our refuge. Thus the psalmist strove against his despondency: at last his faith and hope obtained the victory. Let us learn to check all unbelieving doubts and fears. Apply the promise first to ourselves, and then plead it to God.</body></html>
