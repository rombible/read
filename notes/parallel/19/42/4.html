In the way wherein I walked have they privately laid a snare for me.">Psalm 142:3</a>). But the Authorised Version is better, "when I think of it, my heart must overflow." The expression, "I pour out my soul upon me," may, however, mean, "I weep floods of tears over myself," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "over my lot."<p><span class= "bld">For I had gone with the multitude.</span>--The LXX. and Vulg., as well as the strangeness of the words rendered "multitude" and "went with them," indicate a corruption of the text. Fortunately the general sense and reference of the verse are independent of the doubtful expressions. The poet indulges in a grateful recollection of some great festival, probably the Feast of Tabernacles. (See LXX.)<p><span class= "bld">That kept holyday.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">dancing </span>or <span class= "ital">reeling. </span>But the word is used absolutely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm" title="And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.">Exodus 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-41.htm" title="And you shall keep it a feast to the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.">Leviticus 23:41</a>) for keeping a festival, and especially the Feast of Tabernacles. Dancing appears to have been a recognised part of the ceremonial. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2Samuel 6:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I remember these things</span>; rather, <span class="accented">these things I remember</span> - <span class="accented">the</span> things remembered being those touched on in the rest of the verse - his former free access to the house of God, and habit of frequenting it, especially on festival occasions, when the multitude "kept holy day." "Deep sorrow," as Hengstenberg remarks, "tries to lose itself in the recollection of the happier past." I pour out my soul in me. "The heart <span class="accented">pours itself out</span>, or melts in any one, who is in a manner dissolved by grief and pain." David does not alleviate his sorrow, but aggravates it, by thinking of the happy past.

A gracious soul can take little satisfaction in God's courts, if it do not meet with God himself there. Living souls never can take up their rest any where short of a living God. To appear before the Lord is the desire of the upright, as it is the dread of the hypocrite. Nothing is more grievous to a gracious soul, than what is intended to shake its confidence in the Lord. It was not the remembrance of the pleasures of his court that afflicted David; but the remembrance of the free access he formerly had to God's house, and his pleasure in attending there. Those that commune much with their own hearts, will often have to chide them. See the cure of sorrow. When the soul rests on itself, it sinks; if it catches hold on the power and promise of God, the head is kept above the billows. And what is our support under present woes but this, that we shall have comfort in Him. We have great cause to mourn for sin; but being cast down springs from unbelief and a rebellious will; we should therefore strive and pray against it.</body></html>
