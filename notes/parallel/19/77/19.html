All that we see distinctly is, that through this dark and terrible night, with the enemy pressing close behind, and the driving sea on either side, He led His people like sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron" (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Jewish Church, </span>i. 128).<p>To some minds the abruptness of the conclusion of the psalm marks it as unfinished. But no better end could have been reached in the poet's perplexity than that to which he has been led by his musings on the past, the thought of the religious aids ready to his hand, in the faith and worship left by Moses and Aaron. We are reminded of him who recalled the thoughts of the young man, searching for a higher ideal of duty, back to the law and obedience. Or if the psalm is rather an expression of the feeling of the community than of an individual, there is a pointed significance in the conclusion given to all the national cries of doubt and despair--the one safe course was to remain loyal and true to the ancient institutions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/77.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy way is in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the sea;</span> rather, <span class="accented">was in the sea.</span> Thou wentest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in person before thy people in their passage across the dry bed of the Red Sea; truly there, though invisible (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52, 53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-13.htm">Isaiah 63:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy path in the great waters;</span> literally, <span class="accented">thy paths.</span> So the Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">And thy footsteps are not known;</span> rather, <span class="accented">were not</span>.

God's way is in the sanctuary. We are sure that God is holy in all his works. God's ways are like the deep waters, which cannot be fathomed; like the way of a ship, which cannot be tracked. God brought Israel out of Egypt. This was typical of the great redemption to be wrought out in the fulness of time, both by price and power. If we have harboured doubtful thoughts, we should, without delay, turn our minds to meditate on that God, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, that with him, he might freely give us all things.</body></html>
