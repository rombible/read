So Symmachus, "my wound;" Aquila, "my sickness." Gesenius says, "that which makes my sickness." If we keep this meaning we must understand mental sickness or "madness," and understand the poet to say that to indulge in despairing cries is mere madness (comp. King Lear's, "Oh! that way madness lies"), he will recall God's ancient deliverances, and so re-establish his faith. But it seems more natural to take a sense which the cognate verb very commonly bears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-8.htm" title="Therefore every one that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.">Leviticus 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm" title="Therefore say to the house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the heathen, where you went.">Ezekiel 36:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-7.htm" title="They have cast fire into your sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of your name to the ground.">Psalm 74:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm" title="You have made void the covenant of your servant: you have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.">Psalm 89:39</a>), and render, "I said this (such despair) is on my part profanation, profanation of the years of the right hand of the Most High." To despair of continued help from One who had been so gracious in the past is a kind of blasphemy. The word "profanation" must be understood as repeated for the sake of <span class= "ital">the </span>grammar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/77.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I said, This is my infirmity;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the fault is not in God, but in myself" - in my own weakness and want of faith. But I will remember <span class="cmt_word">the years of the right</span> <span class="cmt_word">hand of the Most High</span>. There is no "I will remember" in the original, which expresses the thought of the writer imperfectly; but some such phrase must of necessity be supplied. The words are retained in the Revised Version and by Professor Cheyne. The remembrance of God's mercies during the many years that are past is that which best sustains us in a time of severe trouble. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/77.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>77:1-10 Days of trouble must be days of prayer; when God seems to have withdrawn from us, we must seek him till we find him. In the day of his trouble the psalmist did not seek for the diversion of business or amusement, but he sought God, and his favor and grace. Those that are under trouble of mind, must pray it away. He pored upon the trouble; the methods that should have relieved him did but increase his grief. When he remembered God, it was only the Divine justice and wrath. His spirit was overwhelmed, and sank under the load. But let not the remembrance of the comforts we have lost, make us unthankful for those that are left. Particularly he called to remembrance the comforts with which he supported himself in former sorrows. Here is the language of a sorrowful, deserted soul, walking in darkness; a common case even among those that fear the Lord, Isa 50:10. Nothing wounds and pierces like the thought of God's being angry. God's own people, in a cloudy and dark day, may be tempted to make wrong conclusions about their spiritual state, and that of God's kingdom in the world. But we must not give way to such fears. Let faith answer them from the Scripture. The troubled fountain will work itself clear again; and the recollection of former times of joyful experience often raises a hope, tending to relief. Doubts and fears proceed from the want and weakness of faith. Despondency and distrust under affliction, are too often the infirmities of believers, and, as such, are to be thought upon by us with sorrow and shame. When, unbelief is working in us, we must thus suppress its risings.</body></html>
