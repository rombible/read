Instead of the usual contrast between the wicked man and the godly one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10, 11</a>, etc.), the psalmist here makes the startling contrast between the wicked man and God! The character of the wicked man is given in four verses (vers. 1-4), the portrait of God in five (vers. 5-9). God's first and principal characteristic is "mercy" - or rather, "loving-kindness" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e1;&#x5e8;</span>). This quality is revealed, not on earth only, but also in heaven, towards the angels. Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. Next to loving-kindness in God comes "faithfulness" - fidelity to every promise that he has ever made, unswerving attachment to those whom he has once loved, undeviating maintenance of the truth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-10.htm">Psalm 57:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-4.htm">Psalm 108:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:5-12 Men may shut up their compassion, yet, with God we shall find mercy. This is great comfort to all believers, plainly to be seen, and not to be taken away. God does all wisely and well; but what he does we know not now, it is time enough to know hereafter. God's loving-kindness is precious to the saints. They put themselves under his protection, and then are safe and easy. Gracious souls, though still desiring more of God, never desire more than God. The gifts of Providence so far satisfy them, that they are content with such things as they have. The benefit of holy ordinances is sweet to a sanctified soul, and strengthening to the spiritual and Divine life. But full satisfaction is reserved for the future state. Their joys shall be constant. God not only works in them a gracious desire for these pleasures, but by his Spirit fills their souls with joy and peace in believing. He quickens whom he will; and whoever will, may come, and take from him of the waters of life freely. May we know, and love, and uprightly serve the Lord; then no proud enemy, on earth or from hell, shall separate us from his love. Faith calleth things that are not, as though they were. It carries us forward to the end of time; it shows us the Lord, on his throne of judgment; the empire of sin fallen to rise no more.</body></html>
