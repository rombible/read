"To the wicked" cannot, as some explain, mean "concerning the wicked." The only possible meaning of the text as it stands is therefore, "Thus saith sin to (me) the wicked man in my heart." But there can be no question that the psalmist wrote "in <span class= "ital">his </span>heart," since ail the ancient versions, with the exception of the Chaldee Paraphrase, followed this reading, and some MSS. still show it. This gives us a very fine sense. Sin is personified as the evil counsellor or prompter sitting in the heart of the wicked to suggest evil thoughts: <span class= "ital">Sin in the wicked man's heart is his oracle. </span>Conscience is on the wrong side.<p><span class= "bld">There is no fear . . .</span>--This is not the suggestion of sin just mentioned, but an explanation of the condition into which the wicked man has sunk. Impiety and irreverence have so corrupted his nature, that sin has become his oracle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The transgression of the wicked saith within</span> <span class="cmt_word">my heart.</span> This is a difficult passage. In the first place, the text is uncertain, since some manuscripts have <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span>, "his heart," in the place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, "my heart." And further, whichever reading we prefer, the meaning is far from clear. Dr. Kay translates, "Transgression's oracle to the wicked is, 'In the interior of my own heart;'" and understands the meaning to be that the sinfulness of the wicked man deludes him into the belief that his wickedness is known to no one but himself - it is all safely locked up in the recesses of his own heart. Professor Alexander suggests as possible, "Thus saith depravity to the wicked man, 'In the midst of my heart, there is no fear of God before his (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God's) eyes.'" Others, preferring <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, render, "Transgression speaks to the wicked within his heart; There is no fear of God," etc.; regarding the two clauses as perfectly independent the one of the ether. This is, perhaps, the best explanation. There is <span class="cmt_word">no fear of God before his eyes.</span> Either he belongs to the class of "fools, who say in their heart, There is no God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>), or he agrees with those who cry, "Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face; he will never see it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-4 From this psalm our hearts should be duly affected with hatred of sin, and seek satisfaction in God's loving-kindness. Here is the root of bitterness, from which all the wickedness of wicked men comes. It takes rise from contempt of God, and the want of due regard to him. Also from the deceit they put upon their own souls. Let us daily beg of God to preserve us from self-flattery. Sin is very hurtful to the sinner himself, and therefore ought to be hateful; but it is not so. It is no marvel, if those that deceive themselves, seek to deceive all mankind; to whom will they be true, who are false to their own souls? It is bad to do mischief, but worse to devise it, to do it with plot and management. If we willingly banish holy meditations in our solitary hours, Satan will soon occupy our minds with sinful imaginations. Hardened sinners stand to what they have done, as though they could justify it before God himself.</body></html>
