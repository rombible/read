It is an awful picture of wickedness of a man abandoning himself without check or remorse to the inspiration of his own evil heart. He goes from bad to worse. In a great English tragedy, the murderer, though he has determined to wade farther in blood, yet prays against the horror of nightly temptations:<p>"Merciful powers,<p>Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature<p>Gives way to in repose.<p>But this man "deviseth mischief upon his bed." When even the worst criminals shudder at their own deeds, whispering to their "deaf pillows" the agonies that creep over them with darkness and silence, this ungodly man of the Hebrew poet's picture is occupied rather in scheming fresh villainies; even then <span class= "ital">he abhorreth not evil, </span>or better, <span class= "ital">rejecteth not, </span>catches rather at every fresh suggestion, and shapes it to his end.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of his mouth are iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">and deceit</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-3.htm">Psalm 28:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He hath left off to be wise, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">to do good.</span> There was a time when he occasionally acted wisely, and did what was right. But that time is gone by. Now he is consistently wicked. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:1-4 From this psalm our hearts should be duly affected with hatred of sin, and seek satisfaction in God's loving-kindness. Here is the root of bitterness, from which all the wickedness of wicked men comes. It takes rise from contempt of God, and the want of due regard to him. Also from the deceit they put upon their own souls. Let us daily beg of God to preserve us from self-flattery. Sin is very hurtful to the sinner himself, and therefore ought to be hateful; but it is not so. It is no marvel, if those that deceive themselves, seek to deceive all mankind; to whom will they be true, who are false to their own souls? It is bad to do mischief, but worse to devise it, to do it with plot and management. If we willingly banish holy meditations in our solitary hours, Satan will soon occupy our minds with sinful imaginations. Hardened sinners stand to what they have done, as though they could justify it before God himself.</body></html>
