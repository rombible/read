The ultimate source of all life is God. Israel had been taught by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-20.htm">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>) that God was <span class="accented">their</span> Life; but this was not all; he is equally the Origin of life to everything that lives - to angels, men, beasts, birds, fishes, zoophytes, plants (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11, 20, 24, 27</a>, etc.). And, as he is the sole Source of natural life, so is he also the one and only Origin of spiritual vitality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-9.htm">Psalm 66:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-57.htm">John 6:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And in thy light shall we see light</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 5, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5-7</a>). God is essentially Life and Light. He "has life in himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>). He "is Light, and in him is no darkness at all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>). The Son, who is "the Light of the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), is but "the Effulgence of his Father's glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, Revised Version), "Light of light," the ray which streams from the Sun of the universe. Yet from him comes the light which enlighteneth all creatures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). "In <span class="accented">his</span> light we see light." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/36.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>36:5-12 Men may shut up their compassion, yet, with God we shall find mercy. This is great comfort to all believers, plainly to be seen, and not to be taken away. God does all wisely and well; but what he does we know not now, it is time enough to know hereafter. God's loving-kindness is precious to the saints. They put themselves under his protection, and then are safe and easy. Gracious souls, though still desiring more of God, never desire more than God. The gifts of Providence so far satisfy them, that they are content with such things as they have. The benefit of holy ordinances is sweet to a sanctified soul, and strengthening to the spiritual and Divine life. But full satisfaction is reserved for the future state. Their joys shall be constant. God not only works in them a gracious desire for these pleasures, but by his Spirit fills their souls with joy and peace in believing. He quickens whom he will; and whoever will, may come, and take from him of the waters of life freely. May we know, and love, and uprightly serve the Lord; then no proud enemy, on earth or from hell, shall separate us from his love. Faith calleth things that are not, as though they were. It carries us forward to the end of time; it shows us the Lord, on his throne of judgment; the empire of sin fallen to rise no more.</body></html>
