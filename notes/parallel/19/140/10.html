Gesenius, deriving from a root meaning "to boil up," renders, "whirlpools," which, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-12.htm" title="You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but you brought us out into a wealthy place.">Psalm 66:12</a>, combines "water" with "fire," as joint emblems of <span class= "ital">perils </span>that cannot be escaped. But Symmachus, Theodotion, and Jerome render "ditches," which is supported by a Rabbinical quotation, given by Delitzsch: "first of all they burned them in pits; when the flesh was consumed they collected the bones, and burned them in coffins."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/140.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let burning coals fall upon them</span>, or, "burning coals shall be thrown upon them." <span class="cmt_word">Let them be cast</span> (or, "they shall be cast") <span class="cmt_word">into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</span> The clauses are declaratory rather than optative. The psalmist sees the wrath of God poured out upon his enemies, who are at the same time God's enemies - they are cast into the fire prepared to receive the wicked - and plunged into deep pits whence they find it impossible to extricate themselves. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/140.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>140:8-13 Believers may pray that God would not grant the desires of the wicked, nor further their evil devices. False accusers will bring mischief upon themselves, even the burning coals of Divine vengeance. And surely the righteous shall dwell in God's presence, and give him thanks for evermore. This is true thanksgiving, even thanks-living: this use we should make of all our deliverances, we should serve God the more closely and cheerfully. Those who, though evil spoken of and ill-used by men, are righteous in the sight of God, being justified by the righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to them, and received by faith, as the effect of which, they live soberly and righteously; these give thanks to the Lord, for the righteousness whereby they are made righteous, and for every blessing of grace, and mercy of life.</body></html>
