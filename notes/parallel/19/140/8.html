The LXX. and Vulg. give the first clause thus: "Give me not over to the enemy, by reason of their own desire;" which may possibly have been in St. Paul's mind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Further not.--</span>The text of this clause has undoubtedly suffered. The Authorised Version follows the LXX. and Vulg. in inserting a negative before the last word. These versions also take the word rendered "wicked devices" as a verb, not finding a noun of the form anywhere else: "They have plotted against me: desert me not, lest they exalt themselves." So also Symmachus, and another Greek version quoted by Origen.<p>As the text at present stands, we must render: <span class= "ital">his plot do not further</span>--<span class= "ital">they lift up. </span>Looking on to the next verse, "the head of those surrounding me," the suggestion at once arises that the verb <span class= "ital">lift up </span>properly belongs to this clause:<p>"His plot do not further.<p>They lift the head, these surrounding me."<p>This arrangement disregards the "selah." and also obliges us to suspect that a clause has dropped cut after the first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-9.htm" title="As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.">Psalm 140:9</a>--a suspicion confirmed by the rhythm.<span class= "note">[20]<p>[20] Mr. Burgess amends to "Further not his plot to his exaltation."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/140.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked</span>. The "desires of the wicked" are hurtful both to themselves and others.

Others translate, "Or how they will exalt themselves!" The third stanza here terminates. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/140.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>140:8-13 Believers may pray that God would not grant the desires of the wicked, nor further their evil devices. False accusers will bring mischief upon themselves, even the burning coals of Divine vengeance. And surely the righteous shall dwell in God's presence, and give him thanks for evermore. This is true thanksgiving, even thanks-living: this use we should make of all our deliverances, we should serve God the more closely and cheerfully. Those who, though evil spoken of and ill-used by men, are righteous in the sight of God, being justified by the righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to them, and received by faith, as the effect of which, they live soberly and righteously; these give thanks to the Lord, for the righteousness whereby they are made righteous, and for every blessing of grace, and mercy of life.</body></html>
