The angelic spectators of the magnificent drama enacted below them cry (not merely speak <span class= "ital">of, </span>as Authorised Version, but <span class= "ital">utter </span>the word) each one, "Glory," obeying the poet's invocation in the prelude.<p>Notice that the effect of the storm on <span class= "ital">men </span>is supposed to be all summed up in the poet's own attitude of listening awe. There is no actual mention of this part of creation; but one feels from the poem that while inanimate nature trembles and suffers, and the godlike intelligences of heaven are engaged in praise, <span class= "ital">man</span> listens and is mute.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve.</span> Plutarch says, "Shepherds accustom their flocks in a thunderstorm to keep together, and put their heads in the same direction; for such as are left alone and separated from the rest through terror cast their young" ('Sympos.,' Quest. 2.). And Pliny, "Solitary sheep cast their lambs in thunderstorms; the remedy is to keep the flock together, since it helps them to have company." A traveller in South Africa observes, "In Bechuanaland, when there are heavy thunderstorms, the antelopes flee in consternation; and the poor Bechuanas start off on the morning following such a storm in quest of the young which have been cast through horror" (see Moffat's 'South Africa,' quoted by Dr. Kay, in his 'Commentary on the Psalms,' p. 93). <span class="cmt_word">And discovereth the forests</span>; or, <span class="accented">strippeth the forests.</span> Denudes them of their leaves and branches. <span class="cmt_word">And in his temple doth every one speak of his glory</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his grand temple, or palace (<span class="accented">heykal</span>), of heaven and earth. In this temple "every one," or rather <span class="accented">everything</span>, all that is in it. is continually speaking of his glory (literally, "says, Glory!"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-11 Exhortation to give glory to God. - The mighty and honourable of the earth are especially bound to honour and worship him; but, alas, few attempt to worship him in the beauty of holiness. When we come before him as the Redeemer of sinners, in repentance faith, and love, he will accept our defective services, pardon the sin that cleaves to them, and approve of that measure of holiness which the Holy Spirit enables us to exercise. We have here the nature of religious worship; it is giving to the Lord the glory due to his name. We must be holy in all our religious services, devoted to God, and to his will and glory. There is a beauty in holiness, and that puts beauty upon all acts of worship. The psalmist here sets forth God's dominion in the kingdom of nature. In the thunder, and lightning, and storm, we may see and hear his glory. Let our hearts be thereby filled with great, and high, and honourable thoughts of God, in the holy adoring of whom, the power of godliness so much consists. O Lord our God, thou art very great! The power of the lightning equals the terror of the thunder. The fear caused by these effects of the Divine power, should remind us of the mighty power of God, of man's weakness, and of the defenceless and desperate condition of the wicked in the day of judgment. But the effects of the Divine word upon the souls of men, under the power of the Holy Spirit, are far greater than those of thunder storms in the nature world. Thereby the stoutest are made to tremble, the proudest are cast down, the secrets of the heart are brought to light, sinners are converted, the savage, sensual, and unclean, become harmless, gentle, and pure. If we have heard God's voice, and have fled for refuge to the hope set before us, let us remember that children need not fear their Father's voice, when he speaks in anger to his enemies. While those tremble who are without shelter, let those who abide in his appointed refuge bless him for their security, looking forward to the day of judgment without dismay, safe as Noah in the ark.</body></html>
