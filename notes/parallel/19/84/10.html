The idea of "doorkeeper," however, though not necessarily involved in the Hebrew word, is suggested in a Korahite psalm, since the Korahites were "keepers of the gates of the tabernacle, and keepers of the entry." Compare with this wish the words which a Greek poet puts into the mouth of his hero, who sweeps the threshold of Apollo's temple:<p>"A pleasant task, O Phoebus, I discharge,<p>Before thine house in reverence of thy seat<p>Of prophecy, an honoured task to me."<p>EURIPIDES, <span class= "ital">Ion, </span>128.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/84.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> than any number of days elsewhere. It is difficult to trace any connection between these concluding verses. They appear to consist of distinct thoughts, which arise in the writer's mind, and are jotted down as they occur to him. One is a thought of loyalty, which finds vent in a prayer for the king (ver. 9). Another is a reflection of the main thought of the psalm, the incomparable blessedness of dwelling in God's house. A third (vers. 11, 12) is the joy and glory of perpetual communion with God and trust in God. See the remarks of Professor Cheyne ('The Book of Psalms,' p. 237). <span class="cmt_word">I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">at the</span> <span class="accented">threshold</span>; but the meaning is well expressed by the Authorized Version. "Doorkeepers in the house of their God" was exactly what the Korahite Levites were (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1, 12-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</span> As their ancestor, Korah, had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-26.htm">Numbers 16:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/84.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>84:8-12 In all our addresses to God, we must desire that he would look on Christ, his Anointed One, and accept us for his sake: we must look to Him with faith, and then God will with favour look upon the face of the Anointed: we, without him, dare not show our faces. The psalmist pleads love to God's ordinances. Let us account one day in God's courts better than a thousand spent elsewhere; and deem the meanest place in his service preferable to the highest earthly preferment. We are here in darkness, but if God be our God, he will be to us a Sun, to enlighten and enliven us, to guide and direct us. We are here in danger, but he will be to us a Shield, to secure us from the fiery darts that fly thick about us. Through he has not promised to give riches and dignities, he has promised to give grace and glory to all that seek them in his appointed way. And what is grace, but heaven begun below, in the knowledge, love, and service of God? What is glory, but the completion of this happiness, in being made like to him, and in fully enjoying him for ever? Let it be our care to walk uprightly, and then let us trust God to give us every thing that is good for us. If we cannot go to the house of the Lord, we may go by faith to the Lord of the house; in him we shall be happy, and may be easy. That man is really happy, whatever his outward circumstances may be, who trusts in the Lord of hosts, the God of Jacob.</body></html>
