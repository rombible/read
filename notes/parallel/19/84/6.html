And <span class= "ital">Baca </span>(<span class= "ital">b?kha</span>) seems to have this signification, whatever origin we give the word. The valley has been variously identified--with the valley of <span class= "ital">Achor </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-15.htm" title="And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.">Hosea 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm" title="And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.">Joshua 7:24</a>); the valley of <span class= "ital">Rephaim </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-22.htm" title="And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.">2Samuel 5:22</a>)--a valley found by Burckhardt in the neighbourhood of Sinai; and one, more recently, by Renan, the last station of the present caravan route from the north to Jerusalem. Of these, the valley of Rephaim is most probably in the poet's mind, since it is described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-5.htm" title="And it shall be as when the harvestman gathers the corn, and reaps the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathers ears in the valley of Rephaim.">Isaiah 17:5</a>) as sterile, and as the text stands, we think of some place devoid of water, but which the courage and faith of the pilgrims treats as if it were well supplied with that indispensable requisite, thus turning adversity itself into a blessing. He either plays on the sound of the word (<span class= "ital">Baca, </span>and <span class= "ital">becaim</span>) or the exudations of the <span class= "ital">balsam </span>shrub gave the valley its name.<p><span class= "bld">The rain also filleth the pools.</span>--That <span class= "ital">rain </span>is the right rendering of the Hebrew word here appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm" title="Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he has given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.">Joel 2:23</a>. The rendering <span class= "ital">pools </span>follows the reading, <span class= "ital">berech�th</span>; but the text has <span class= "ital">berach�th, "</span>blessings," as read by the LXX. and generally adopted now. Render <span class= "ital">yea, as the autumn rain covers </span>(<span class= "ital">it</span>)<span class= "ital"> with blessings, i.e., </span>just as the benign showers turn a wilderness into a garden, so resolution and faith turn disadvantage to profit. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/35-6.htm" title="Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.">Isaiah 35:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-18.htm" title="Remember you not the former things, neither consider the things of old.">Isaiah 43:18</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/84.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a wall;</span> rather, <span class="accented">through the valley of weeping</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.).

They are to his soul as the nest to the bird. Yet they are only an earnest of the happiness of heaven; but how can men desire to enter that holy habitation, who complain of Divine ordinances as wearisome? Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go on in the exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenly city may have to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many a thirsty desert; but wells of salvation shall be opened for them, and consolations sent for their support. Those that press forward in their Christian course, shall find God add grace to their graces. And those who grow in grace, shall be perfect in glory.</body></html>
