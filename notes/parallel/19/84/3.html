"Our common house- sparrow is found on the coast in the towns, and inland its place is taken by a very closely-allied species, <span class= "ital">Passer Cisalpina</span>" (Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of the Bible, </span>p. 202).<p><span class= "bld">Swallow.</span>--Heb. <span class= "ital">deror, </span>which by its etymology implies a bird of rapid whirling flight. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-2.htm" title="As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.">Proverbs 26:2</a>, where this characteristic is especially noticed.) The ancient versions take the word as cognate with "turtle-dove." In an appendix to Delitzsch's Commentary on the Psalms, Dr. J. G. Wetzstein, identifies the <span class= "ital">tsippor </span>with the <span class= "ital">osfur </span>of the Arabs, a generic name for small chirping birds, and <span class= "ital">deror </span>with <span class= "ital">d-ri. </span>which is specific of the <span class= "ital">sparrow.</span><p><span class= "bld">Even thy altars.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">at </span>or <span class= "ital">near thine altars, </span>though even if taken as in the Authorised "Version the meaning is the same. There is no real occasion for the great difficulty that has been made about this verse. It is absurd indeed to think of the birds actually nesting on the altars; but that they were found in and about the Temple is quite probable, just as in Herodotus (i. 159) we read of Aristodicus making the circuit of the temple at Branchidae, and taking the nests of young sparrows and other birds. (Comp. the story in 'lian of the man who was slain for harming a sparrow that had sheltered in the temple of 'sculapius.) Ewald gives many other references, and among them one to Burckhardt showing that birds nest in the Kaaba at Mecca.<p>The Hebrew poetic style is not favourable to simile, or the psalmist would have written (as a modern would), "As the birds delight to nest at thine altars, so do I love to dwell in thine house."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/84.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young</span>. Both sparrows and swallows abound in Palestine. Canon Tristram found the nest of a sparrow "so closely allied to our own that it is difficult to distinguish it," in a chink of the Haram wall at Jerusalem, near the Golden Gate ('Land of Israel,' p. 182). An anecdote related by Herodotus (1, 159) shows that sparrows built about the Greek temples. The general meaning of the figure in this place seems to be, "If even birds love to build their nests, as they do, in the sacred precincts, how much more reason has the believing heart to find its home in the house of its God!" But the psalmist thinks it enough to suggest the parallel, and does not stop to carry it out. Even <span class="cmt_word">thine altars.</span> The "altar" is put, by metonymy, for the temple itself. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/84.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>84:1-7 The ordinances of God are the believer's solace in this evil world; in them he enjoys the presence of the living God: this causes him to regret his absence from them. They are to his soul as the nest to the bird. Yet they are only an earnest of the happiness of heaven; but how can men desire to enter that holy habitation, who complain of Divine ordinances as wearisome? Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go on in the exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenly city may have to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many a thirsty desert; but wells of salvation shall be opened for them, and consolations sent for their support. Those that press forward in their Christian course, shall find God add grace to their graces. And those who grow in grace, shall be perfect in glory.</body></html>
