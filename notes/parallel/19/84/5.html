It is improbable that the poet would turn abruptly from the description of the swallows in the Temple to what looks like a description of a real journey, with a locality, or at all events a district, which was well known, introduced by its proper name, and yet intend only a figurative reference. On the other hand, it is quite in the Hebrew manner to mix up the ideal with the actual, and to present the spiritual side by side with the literal. We have, then, here recorded the actual experience of a pilgrim's route. But quite naturally and correctly has the world seen in it a description of the pilgrimage of life, and drawn from it many a sweet and consoling lesson.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Blessed is the man.</span>--Or collective, <span class= "ital">men, </span>as the suffix, <span class= "ital">their </span>hearts, shows.<p><span class= "bld">Ways.</span>--From a root meaning <span class= "ital">to cast up</span>--and so <span class= "ital">highways </span>marked by the heaps of stone piled up at the side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-14.htm" title="And shall say, Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people.">Isaiah 57:14</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-15.htm" title="Because my people has forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;">Jeremiah 18:15</a> mere <span class= "ital">footways </span>or <span class= "ital">bypaths </span>are contrasted, and so the <span class= "ital">highway </span>lends itself as a metaphor <span class= "ital">for the way of peace and righteousness </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-28.htm" title="In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death.">Proverbs 12:28</a>), as it is taken here by the Chaldee and some modern expositors. But this moral intention is secondary to the actual desire to join the pilgrim band towards Sion, and this the verse describes in words which are echoed exactly in our own Chaucer:<p>"So pricketh hem Nature in her corages (in their hearts)<p>Than longen folk to go on pilgrimages."<p>The well-known and deeply loved route to the sacred shrine is in their minds, their hearts are set upon it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/84.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee.</span> God is the "Strength" of all who trust in him.

They are to his soul as the nest to the bird. Yet they are only an earnest of the happiness of heaven; but how can men desire to enter that holy habitation, who complain of Divine ordinances as wearisome? Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go on in the exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenly city may have to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many a thirsty desert; but wells of salvation shall be opened for them, and consolations sent for their support. Those that press forward in their Christian course, shall find God add grace to their graces. And those who grow in grace, shall be perfect in glory.</body></html>
