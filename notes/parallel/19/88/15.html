(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm" title="For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinks up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm" title="Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:">Job 9:34</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">Distracted.</span>--The Hebrew word is peculiar to the place. The ancient versions all agree in taking it as a verb, and rendering it by some general term denoting "trouble." But the context evidently requires a stronger word, and possibly connecting with a cognate word meaning "wheel," we may get, "I turn giddy." A change of a stroke in one letter would give "I grow frigid." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-8.htm" title="I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.">Psalm 38:8</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/88.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up</span>. This is a new point. The psalmist's afflictions have not come upon him recently. He does not merely mean, as some have supposed, that, like other men, as soon as he was born he began to die, but speaks of something, if not absolutely peculiar to himself, yet at any rate rare and abnormal - a long continuance in a dying state, such as could only have been brought about by some terribly severe malady. <span class="cmt_word">While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I have endured thy terrors</span>; <span class="accented">I am exhausted.</span> (On the endurance of God's "terrors," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>.) The natural result would be a state, not of distraction, but of exhaustion. (So Kay, and substantially Professor Cheyne.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/88.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>88:10-18 Departed souls may declare God's faithfulness, justice, and lovingkindness; but deceased bodies can neither receive God's favours in comfort, nor return them in praise. The psalmist resolved to continue in prayer, and the more so, because deliverance did not come speedily. Though our prayers are not soon answered, yet we must not give over praying. The greater our troubles, the more earnest and serious we should be in prayer. Nothing grieves a child of God so much as losing sight of him; nor is there any thing he so much dreads as God's casting off his soul. If the sun be clouded, that darkens the earth; but if the sun should leave the earth, what a dungeon would it be! Even those designed for God's favours, may for a time suffer his terrors. See how deep those terrors wounded the psalmist. If friends are put far from us by providences, or death, we have reason to look upon it as affliction. Such was the calamitous state of a good man. But the pleas here used were peculiarly suited to Christ. And we are not to think that the holy Jesus suffered for us only at Gethsemane and on Calvary. His whole life was labour and sorrow; he was afflicted as never man was, from his youth up. He was prepared for that death of which he tasted through life. No man could share in the sufferings by which other men were to be redeemed. All forsook him, and fled. Oftentimes, blessed Jesus, do we forsake thee; but do not forsake us, O take not thy Holy Spirit from us.</body></html>
