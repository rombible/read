The hope of this had hardly yet dawned on Israel. The underworld is imagined as a vast sepulchre in which the dead lie, each in his place, silent and motionless, and the poet asks how they can rise there to utter the praise of God who has forgotten them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-5.htm" title="Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you remember no more: and they are cut off from your hand.">Psalm 88:5</a>). That this is meant, and not a coming forth again into a land of living interests, is shown in the next two verses. (See Notes.)<p><span class= "bld">Dead.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">rephaim, </span>a word applied also to the gigantic races of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm" title="Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-20.htm" title="(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelled therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>, &c.), but here evidently (as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm" title="For her house inclines to death, and her paths to the dead.">Proverbs 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm" title="But he knows not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.">Proverbs 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-16.htm" title="The man that wanders out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.">Proverbs 21:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm" title="Hell from beneath is moved for you to meet you at your coming: it stirs up the dead for you, even all the chief ones of the earth; it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.">Isaiah 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm" title="Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a>) meaning the <span class= "ital">dead.</span><p>All the passages cited confirm the impression got from this psalm of the Hebrew conception of the state of the dead. They were languid, sickly shapes, lying supine, cut off from all the hopes and interests of the upper air, and even oblivious of them all, but retaining <span class= "ital">so </span>much of sensation as to render them conscious of the gloomy monotony of death. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/17-27.htm" title="Who shall praise the most High in the grave, instead of them which live and give thanks?">Ecclesiasticus 17:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/baruch/2-17.htm" title="Open thine eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in the graves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give unto the Lord neither praise nor righteousness:">Baruch 2:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/88.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou show wonders to the dead?</span> Am I to receive no mercy till I am dead? and then wilt thou work a miracle for my restoration and deliverance? <span class="cmt_word">Shall the dead arise and praise thee?</span> rather, <span class="accented">the shades</span> (<span class="accented">rephaim</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-5.htm">Job 26:5</a>. The word <span class="accented">rephaim</span> designates the wan, shadowy ghosts that have gone down to Hades (Sheol), and are resting there. Shall these suddenly rise up and engage in the worship and praise of God? The psalmist does not, any more than Job (Job 14:14), expect such a resurrection. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/88.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>88:10-18 Departed souls may declare God's faithfulness, justice, and lovingkindness; but deceased bodies can neither receive God's favours in comfort, nor return them in praise. The psalmist resolved to continue in prayer, and the more so, because deliverance did not come speedily. Though our prayers are not soon answered, yet we must not give over praying. The greater our troubles, the more earnest and serious we should be in prayer. Nothing grieves a child of God so much as losing sight of him; nor is there any thing he so much dreads as God's casting off his soul. If the sun be clouded, that darkens the earth; but if the sun should leave the earth, what a dungeon would it be! Even those designed for God's favours, may for a time suffer his terrors. See how deep those terrors wounded the psalmist. If friends are put far from us by providences, or death, we have reason to look upon it as affliction. Such was the calamitous state of a good man. But the pleas here used were peculiarly suited to Christ. And we are not to think that the holy Jesus suffered for us only at Gethsemane and on Calvary. His whole life was labour and sorrow; he was afflicted as never man was, from his youth up. He was prepared for that death of which he tasted through life. No man could share in the sufferings by which other men were to be redeemed. All forsook him, and fled. Oftentimes, blessed Jesus, do we forsake thee; but do not forsake us, O take not thy Holy Spirit from us.</body></html>
