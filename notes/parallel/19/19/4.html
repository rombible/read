But neither of these seems very appropriate here. The verse wants <span class= "ital">sound </span>or <span class= "ital">voice, </span>and words of this intention actually appear in the LXX., Vulg., Symmachus, Jerome, and the Syriac.<p>The use which St. Paul makes of these words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm" title="But I say, Have they not heard? Yes truly, their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.">Romans 10:18</a>) is as natural as striking. The march of truth has always been compared to the spread of light. But the allegorical interpretation based on the quotation, making the heavens a figure of the Church and the sun of the Gospel, loses the force and beauty of the Apostle's application.<p><span class= "bld">In them hath . . .</span>--This clause is not only rightly joined to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm" title="Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.

That the phenomena of sunset should engage the poet's attention before those of sunrise was inevitable in a race who reckoned "the evening and the morning were the first day." The LXX. and Vulg. completely spoil the picture by rendering "he hath pitched his tent in the sun."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their line is gone out through all the earth</span>. It is much disputed what "their <span class="accented">line"</span> means. The word used, <span class="accented">qav</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;</span>), means, ordinarily, a "measuring-line" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>, etc.), whence it comes to have the further sense of a terminus or boundary; that which the measuring-line marks out. It is also thought to have signified an architect's rule; and, hence, anything regulative, as a decree, precept, or law (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a>). The LXX. translated it in this place by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a musical sound;" and Dr. Kay supposes "the regulative chord," or "key-note." to be intended. Perhaps "decree" would be in this place the best rendering, since it would suit the "words" (<span class="accented">minim</span>) of the second clause. The "decree" of the heavens is one proclaiming the glory of God, and the duty of all men to worship him. <span class="cmt_word">And their words to the end of the world</span>. Though they have neither speech nor language, nor any articulate words, yet they have "words" in a certain sense. <span class="accented">Millim is</span> said to be used of thoughts just shaping themselves into language, but not yet uttered (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun</span>. God has made the heavens the sun's dwelling-place, the place where he passes the day. There is, perhaps, a tacit allusion to the Shechinah, which dwelt in the tabernacle of the congregation: <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-6 The heavens so declare the glory of God, and proclaim his wisdom, power, and goodness, that all ungodly men are left without excuse. They speak themselves to be works of God's hands; for they must have a Creator who is eternal, infinitely wise, powerful, and good. The counter-changing of day and night is a great proof of the power of God, and calls us to observe, that, as in the kingdom of nature, so in that of providence, he forms the light, and creates the darkness, Isa 45:7, and sets the one against the other. The sun in the firmament is an emblem of the Sun of righteousness, the Bridegroom of the church, and the Light of the world, diffusing Divine light and salvation by his gospel to the nations of the earth. He delights to bless his church, which he has espoused to himself; and his course will be unwearied as that of the sun, till the whole earth is filled with his light and salvation. Let us pray for the time when he shall enlighten, cheer, and make fruitful every nation on earth, with the blessed salvation. They have no speech or language, so some read it, and yet their voice is heard. All people may hear these preachers speak in their own tongue the wonderful works of God. Let us give God the glory of all the comfort and benefit we have by the lights of heaven, still looking above and beyond them to the Sun of righteousness.</body></html>
