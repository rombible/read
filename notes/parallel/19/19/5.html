And the land had rest forty years.">Judges 5:31</a>). This want of twilight, this absence of silent preparation for the supreme moment, distinguishes Eastern songs of sunrise from the poetry of the West. There are no musterings of "mute companies of changeful clouds," no "avant couriers of the light," no "grey lines fretting the clouds as messengers of day." Unheralded, unannounced, the sun leaps forth in all his splendour--a young bridegroom with the joy of the wedding-day still on his countenance, a hero leaping forth on his path of conquest and glory. How different the suggested feeling of this from the wistful tenderness of Milton's dawn coming forth "with pilgrim steps in amice grey;" or Shakespeare's "morn in russet clad," that "walks o'er the dew" of the high eastern hill.<p><span class= "bld">Chamber.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">chuphah, </span>a marriage chamber or bed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-16.htm" title="Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.">Joel 2:16</a>).

The sun's "chamber" is where he passes the night - below the earth; from this he bursts forth at morning in his full glory, scattering the darkness, and lighting up his splendid "tabernacle<span class="cmt_word">." And rejoiceth as a strong man-to run a race</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>, "As the sun when he goeth forth <span class="accented">in his might"</span>). The Prayer-book Version, if less literal, better conveys the spirit of the original. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-6 The heavens so declare the glory of God, and proclaim his wisdom, power, and goodness, that all ungodly men are left without excuse. They speak themselves to be works of God's hands; for they must have a Creator who is eternal, infinitely wise, powerful, and good. The counter-changing of day and night is a great proof of the power of God, and calls us to observe, that, as in the kingdom of nature, so in that of providence, he forms the light, and creates the darkness, Isa 45:7, and sets the one against the other. The sun in the firmament is an emblem of the Sun of righteousness, the Bridegroom of the church, and the Light of the world, diffusing Divine light and salvation by his gospel to the nations of the earth. He delights to bless his church, which he has espoused to himself; and his course will be unwearied as that of the sun, till the whole earth is filled with his light and salvation. Let us pray for the time when he shall enlighten, cheer, and make fruitful every nation on earth, with the blessed salvation. They have no speech or language, so some read it, and yet their voice is heard. All people may hear these preachers speak in their own tongue the wonderful works of God. Let us give God the glory of all the comfort and benefit we have by the lights of heaven, still looking above and beyond them to the Sun of righteousness.</body></html>
