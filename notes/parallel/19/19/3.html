But this gives an inadmissible sense to <span class= "ital">davar, </span>which does not mean language, but a spoken word. Besides, it was not a likely thought for the psalmist, that the Divine tradition of the heavens, while it travels over the whole earth, would be everywhere intelligible. (2) "It is not speech, it is not words <span class= "ital">whose </span>voice is inaudible," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>unintelligible, but, on the contrary, it is a manifestation to all the world. But the parallelism is against this. The line "their voice is not heard" is but the rhythmic echo of there is no speech nor word." (3) We therefore keep close to the literal rendering, <span class= "ital">There is no speech, there are no </span>(<span class= "ital">uttered</span>)<span class= "ital"> words, their voice is inaudible; </span>understanding the poet to say, that the manifestation of the Creator's glory, which he has just imagined the heavens proclaiming, and of which each succeeding day hands on the tale, is not made in audible words. The communication of the sky is <span class= "ital">eloquent, </span>but <span class= "ital">mute; </span>its voice is for the heart and emotion, not the ear. So Addison--<p>"What though in solemn silence all<p>Move round this dark terrestrial ball,<p>What though no real voice or sound<p>Amidst their radiant orbs be found?<p>In reason's ear they all rejoice<p>And utter forth a glorious voice,<p>For ever singing as they shine<p>The hand that made us is Divine."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is no speech nor language, where their voice is</span> <span class="cmt_word">not heard;</span> rather, <span class="accented">there is no speech</span>, <span class="accented">there are no words</span>; <span class="accented">their voles is not heard</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the speech which they utter is not common speech - it is without sound, without language; no articulate voice is to be heard. (So Ewald, Hup-feld, Perowne, Kay, Hengstenberg, Alexander, and our Revisers.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-6 The heavens so declare the glory of God, and proclaim his wisdom, power, and goodness, that all ungodly men are left without excuse. They speak themselves to be works of God's hands; for they must have a Creator who is eternal, infinitely wise, powerful, and good. The counter-changing of day and night is a great proof of the power of God, and calls us to observe, that, as in the kingdom of nature, so in that of providence, he forms the light, and creates the darkness, Isa 45:7, and sets the one against the other. The sun in the firmament is an emblem of the Sun of righteousness, the Bridegroom of the church, and the Light of the world, diffusing Divine light and salvation by his gospel to the nations of the earth. He delights to bless his church, which he has espoused to himself; and his course will be unwearied as that of the sun, till the whole earth is filled with his light and salvation. Let us pray for the time when he shall enlighten, cheer, and make fruitful every nation on earth, with the blessed salvation. They have no speech or language, so some read it, and yet their voice is heard. All people may hear these preachers speak in their own tongue the wonderful works of God. Let us give God the glory of all the comfort and benefit we have by the lights of heaven, still looking above and beyond them to the Sun of righteousness.</body></html>
