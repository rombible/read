Instead of the free lyric movement of the preceding verse, we come suddenly upon the most finished specimen of didactic poetry in regular metre, exhibiting a perfect balance of expression as well as of thought, so perfect in the original, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/19-7.htm" title="The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.">Psalm 19:7-9</a> the number of words is the same in each clause.

The law, <span class= "ital">torah, </span>means in its primary use "instruction," and therefore is used of prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm" title="Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm" title="Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.">Isaiah 8:16</a>), but here undoubtedly bears its common and more limited sense. Testimony, from a root meaning "to repeat," suggests the solemn earnestness and insistence of the Divine commands.<p>The description "perfect" and "sure" suggests the lofty ideal prescribed by the Law, and the reliance which the Hebrew might place upon it as a rule of conduct. The word "simple" is generally used in a bad sense, but here has its primary meaning, "open," "ingenuous," "impressible," easily led either towards folly or wisdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> - The transition from the glories of the material universe to the "law of the Lord" is abrupt and startling. Some go so far as to say that there is no connection at all between the first and second parts of the psalm. But it is the law and order that pervades the material universe which constitutes its main glory; and the analogy between God's physical laws and his moral laws is evident, and generally admitted (see the great work of Bishop Butler, part 1.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Law of the Lord is perfect.</span> Whatsoever proceeds from God is perfect in its kind; his "Law" especially - the rule of life to his rational creatures.

The Law, by instructing men, restores them from moral blindness to the light which is theirs by nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19</a>), and, as a further consequence, in many cases, restores them from sin to righteousness<span class="cmt_word">. The testimony of the Lord is sure</span>. 'Eduth - the word translated "testimony" - is employed especially of the Decalogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16, 21, 22, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>; 17:23; 18:2, etc.); but may be regarded as sue of the many synonyms under which the whole Law may be spoken of (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-2.htm">Psalm 119:2, 14, 22, 24, 88</a>, etc.). The Law is "sure" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fixed, firm, stable - in comparison with the fleeting, shifting, unstable judgments of human reason. <span class="cmt_word">Making wise the simple</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enlightening their moral judgment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:7-10 The Holy Scripture is of much greater benefit to us than day or night, than the air we breathe, or the light of the sun. To recover man out of his fallen state, there is need of the word of God. The word translated law, may be rendered doctrine, and be understood as meaning all that teaches us true religion. The whole is perfect; its tendency is to convert or turn the soul from sin and the world, to God and holiness. It shows our sinfulness and misery in departing from God, and the necessity of our return to him. This testimony is sure, to be fully depended on: the ignorant and unlearned believing what God saith, become wise unto salvation. It is a sure direction in the way of duty. It is a sure fountain of living comforts, and a sure foundation of lasting hopes. The statues of the Lord are right, just as they should be; and, because they are right, they rejoice the heart. The commandments of the Lord are pure, holy, just, and good. By them we discover our need of a Saviour; and then learn how to adorn his gospel. They are the means which the Holy Spirit uses in enlightening the eyes; they bring us to a sight and sense of our sin and misery, and direct us in the way of duty. The fear of the Lord, that is, true religion and godliness, is clean, it will cleanse our way; and it endureth for ever. The ceremonial law is long since done away, but the law concerning the fear of God is ever the same. The judgments of the Lord, his precepts, are true; they are righteous, and they are so altogether; there is no unrighteousness in any of them. Gold is only for the body, and the concerns of time; but grace is for the soul, and the concerns of eternity. The word of God, received by faith, is more precious than gold; it is sweet to the soul, sweeter than honey. The pleasure of sense soon surfeit, yet never satisfy; but those of religion are substantial and satisfying; there is no danger of excess.</body></html>
