The judgment seems to be adjourned, or to be left to the conscience of the defendants." The faithful are summoned, and appear, but not to receive unqualified commendation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-40</a>). Rather they receive a warning. The strong and prolonged depreciation of sacrifice (vers. 8-13) necessarily implies that in the religion of the time too much stress was laid upon it. We know that, in the heathen world, men sought to buy God's favour by their sacrifices, some] believing that, physically, the gods were nourished by the steam of the victims, others regarding them as laid under obligations which they could not disregard (Plato, 'Rep.,' it. &sect; 6; Rawlinson, 'Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 124, 125). We know, too, that, in the later monarchy, sacrifice to so great an extent superseded true spiritual worship among the Israelites themselves, that it became an offence to God, and was spoken of in terms of reprobation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>). Already, it would seem, this tendency was manifesting itself, and a warning from Heaven was needed against it<span class="cmt_word">.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O my people, and I will speak</span>. God will not speak to deaf ears. Unless men are ready to attend to him, he keeps silence<span class="cmt_word">. O Israel, and I will testify against thee</span>; or, <span class="accented">protest unto thee</span> (Kay, Cheyne). I am <span class="accented">God</span>, even thy God. And therefore am entitled to be heard. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/50.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>50:7-15 To obey is better than sacrifice, and to love God and our neighbour better than all burnt-offerings. We are here warned not to rest in these performances. And let us beware of resting in any form. God demands the heart, and how can human inventions please him, when repentance, faith, and holiness are neglected? In the day of distress we must apply to the Lord by fervent prayer. Our troubles, though we see them coming from God's hand, must drive us to him, not drive us from him. We must acknowledge him in all our ways, depend upon his wisdom, power, and goodness, and refer ourselves wholly to him, and so give him glory. Thus must we keep up communion with God; meeting him with prayers under trials, and with praises in deliverances. A believing supplicant shall not only be graciously answered as to his petition, and so have cause for praising God, but shall also have grace to praise him.</body></html>
