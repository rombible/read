Most probably it is a term (possibly Coptic) for some large sea or river monster symbolic of Egypt. (Comp. the word "dragons," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm" title="You did divide the sea by your strength: you brake the heads of the dragons in the waters.">Psalm 74:13</a>, and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-13.htm" title="If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.">Job 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm" title="He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.">Job 26:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Ethiopia--</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">Kh-sh </span>(in Authorised Version <span class= "ital">Cush</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm" title="And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.">Genesis 10:6</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-9.htm" title="And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,">2Kings 19:9</a>.)<p>There is no need with our explanation to look for emblematic reasons for the choice of names in this verse--as Egypt for antiquity; Babylon, strength; Tyre, wealth, &c. There is no one of the districts where Jews of the Dispersion might not have been found, but no doubt in his enumeration the poet takes care to mention countries near and far, as Philistia and Ethiopia. There appears, however, to have been a district in Babylonia known to the Hebrews as <span class= "ital">Kh-sh </span>(Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Origines de l'Histoire; </span>and see a paper on the site of Eden, in the <span class= "ital">Nineteenth Century </span>for October, 1882). The parallelism would be improved by this reference here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/87.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - The Almighty is introduced as making a revelation to the psalmist. He will cause the Gentiles to flock into his Church, even those who have been hitherto the most bitter enemies of Israel (ver. 4), and will place these strangers on a par with such as have belonged to his Church from their birth (vers. 4, 5, 6), admitting them to every blessing and every privilege. The Church, thus augmented, shall be taken under his own protection, and "established," or placed on a sure footing, forever. Compare our Lord's promise to St. Peter," On this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will make mention of Rahab;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Egypt.

In the records of heaven, the meanest of those who are born again stand registered. When God renders to every man according to his works, he shall observe who enjoyed the privileges of his sanctuary. To them much was given, and of them much will be required. Let those that dwell in Zion, mark this, and live up to their profession. Zion's songs shall be sung with joy and triumph. The springs of the joy of a carnal worldling are in wealth and pleasure; but of a gracious soul, in the word of God and prayer. All grace and consolation are derived from Christ, through his ordinances, to the souls of believers.</body></html>
