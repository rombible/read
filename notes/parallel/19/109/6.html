<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm" title="Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.">Jeremiah 51:27</a>, against Hitzig's proposed "Pronounce against him--guilty," which also would only anticipate <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-7.htm" title="When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.">Psalm 109:7</a>. (Comp., too, the noun "office" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-8.htm" title="Let his days be few; and let another take his office.">Psalm 109:8</a>, from the same verb.) The wish expressed is that the persons indicated may fall into the hands of an unscrupulous judge. If, however, we are to think of the divine judgment, then this clause must be taken as exactly parallel to the next: "Appoint a wicked man against him." Here the imprecatory part of the psalm begins, and it has been ingeniously argued that the whole of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/109-6.htm" title="Set you a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.">Psalm 109:6-20</a>) is a quotation, giving, not the psalmist's curse on his foes, but theirs on <span class= "ital">him. </span>Such quotations, without any introductory words, are common, and the theory is tenable, but improbable.<p><span class= "bld">Satan.</span>--By no means here a proper name, though the LXX. and Vulg. have <span class= "ital">diabolus. </span>The use of the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm" title="For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself to prayer.">Psalm 109:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-20.htm" title="Let this be the reward of my adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.">Psalm 109:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-29.htm" title="Let my adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.">Psalm 109:29</a> is decisive on giving it the general meaning, "adversary" (as in margin) here; even though without the article. Satan is used for the tempting angel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1Chronicles 21:1</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a> we find the same post, "at the right hand," assigned to the accuser. An unscrupulous judge and an adversary as accuser, these are the substance of this imprecation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/109.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-15.</span> - The imprecatory portion of the psalm now begins. It is no doubt true to say, with Tholuck, that "no passion is discernible in the imprecations, dreadful as they are." Clearly the writer is not moved by personal feelings of hostility, but by a spirit of justice, and an intense abhorrence of sin. He delivers a calm judicial sentence. Still, the spirit of Christian love must ever shrink from such utterances, which belong to an earlier and less perfect dispensation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-56</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thou a wicked man over him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> judge him (see ver. 7). A persecutor deserves to be himself persecuted, an oppressor to be himself oppressed. "Nec lex justior ulla est, Quam necis artifices arte periresua." <span class="cmt_word">And let Satan stand at his right hand</span>; rather, <span class="accented">an adversary</span>, or an <span class="accented">accuser.</span> In courts of justice the accuser stood at the accused person's right hand. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/109.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>109:6-20 The Lord Jesus may speak here as a Judge, denouncing sentence on some of his enemies, to warn others. When men reject the salvation of Christ, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, Go, ye cursed, upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! How it will affect the senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, with pain, anguish, horror, and despair! Think on these things, sinners, tremble and repent.</body></html>
