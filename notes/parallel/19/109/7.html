The meaning is, "may he go out of court a condemned man."<p><span class= "bld">Let his prayer become sin.</span>--If this clause stood by itself, the most natural way would be to give "prayer" and "sin" their usual sense, and see in it the horrible hope that the man's prayer to God for mercy would be reckoned as "sin." That such was the result of the performance of religious rites by a wicked man was, it is true, a thought familiar to the Hebrew. (See, in addition to the marginal reference, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-8.htm" title="The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.">Proverbs 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-27.htm" title="The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind?">Proverbs 21:27</a>.) But the judgment just spoken of is that of an earthly tribunal. Hence we must render here, <span class= "ital">let his prayer be an offence, </span>that is, instead of procuring him a mitigation of his sentence, let it rather provoke the unscrupulous judge to make it heavier. For sin in this sense of offence, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm" title="If the spirit of the ruler rise up against you, leave not your place; for yielding pacifies great offenses.">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-21.htm" title="Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.">1Kings 1:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/109.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he shall be judged, let him be condemned</span>; literally, <span class="accented">let him go forth condemned</span>; Let him quit the court under sentence. <span class="cmt_word">And let his prayer become sin.</span> The most terrible of all the imprecations. "Let him even be unable to pray to God acceptably," and so let any prayer that he offers when he is brought low be an additional sin (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12-15</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/109.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>109:6-20 The Lord Jesus may speak here as a Judge, denouncing sentence on some of his enemies, to warn others. When men reject the salvation of Christ, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, Go, ye cursed, upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! How it will affect the senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, with pain, anguish, horror, and despair! Think on these things, sinners, tremble and repent.</body></html>
