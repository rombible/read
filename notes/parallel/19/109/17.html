In a good sense the same figure is a favourite one with the Hebrews. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-5.htm" title="And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.">Isaiah 11:5</a>.)<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-19.htm" title="Let it be to him as the garment which covers him, and for a girdle with which he is girded continually.">Psalm 109:19</a> has struck most commentators as an anticlimax, and the quotation theory is supported by this fact. But imprecations show their impotence in this way; the angry soul can never be quite "unpacked with curses;" the language of passion exhausts itself too soon, and a violent speech often dies away in unintelligible mutterings or even gestures of rage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/109.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">so it came upon him</span> (Revised Version), or <span class="accented">so it shall come upon him</span> (LXX., Cheyne).

When men reject the salvation of Christ, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, Go, ye cursed, upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! How it will affect the senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, with pain, anguish, horror, and despair! Think on these things, sinners, tremble and repent.</body></html>
