The hatred of the wicked for the good is a plain fact of history, and quite indisputable. "Words of hatred" are less patent, since they are often restrained from prudential considerations. But sometimes free vent is given to them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And fought against me without a cause</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-7.htm">Psalm 35:7, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-161.htm">Psalm 119:161</a>). Saul's hatred towards David was markedly of this character - un-provoked by either act or word from its object. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/109.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>109:1-5.

David's enemies laughed at him for his devotion, but they could not laugh him out of it.</body></html>
