(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm" title="The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm" title="His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.">Hosea 14:6</a>.) The epithet "green" hardly refers to the colour so much as the "vigour" of the tree, for the foliage of "wan grey olive wood" cannot be called verdant. But though the olive is scarcely, to our Western eyes, a beautiful tree, "to the Oriental the coolness of the pale-blue foliage, its evergreen freshness, spread like a silver sea along the slopes of the hills, speaks of peace and plenty, food and gladness" (Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of the Bible, </span>p. 374).<p><span class= "bld">In the house of God.</span>--Here and in the more elaborate simile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-13.htm" title="Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.">Psalm 92:13</a>) the situation, "in the house of God," is added to show that the prophecy has come of religious trust. It is quite possible that trees were actually planted in the precincts of the Temple, as they are in the Haram area now, so that the rendering, "near the house of God," would express a literal fact. Or the whole may be figurative, as in the verse, "like the olive branches round about Thy table."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God</span>. In conclusion, the psalmist contrasts his own condition, as one of God's people, with that of Doeg, which he had described in vers. 7-9. Doeg is about to be "plucked up" and "rooted out of the land of the living" (ver. 5); he is like a flourishing green olive tree planted in the sanctuary, or "house of God." Doeg is entirely without any trust in the Almighty (ver. 7); he declares of himself, <span class="cmt_word">I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever</span>. It is questioned whether olive trees were at any time planted in the courts of either the tabernacle or the temple; but it certainly cannot be proved that they were not. In the courts of Egyptian temples trees were abundant (Herod., 2:138; Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 236), also probably in Phoenician temples (Perrot and Chipiez, ' Histoire de l'Art dans l'An-tiquite,' vol. 3. p. 322). And to this day there grow in the Hardin area at Jerusalem, on the site of the Jewish temple, a number of magnificent cypresses, olive, and lemon trees. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/52.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>52:6-9 Those wretchedly deceive themselves, who think to support themselves in power and wealth without God. The wicked man trusted in the abundance of his riches; he thought his wickedness would help him to keep his wealth. Right or wrong, he would get what he could, and keep what he had, and ruin any one that stood in his way; this he thought would strengthen him; but see what it comes to! Those who by faith and love dwell in the house of God, shall be like green olive-trees there. And that we may be as green olive-trees, we must live a life of faith and holy confidence in God and his grace. It adds much to the beauty of our profession, and to fruitfulness in every grace, to be much in praising God; and we never can want matter for praise. His name alone can be our refuge and strong tower. It is very good for us to wait on that saving name; there is nothing better to calm and quiet our spirits, when disturbed, and to keep us in the way of duty, when tempted to use any crooked courses for our relief, than to hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord. None ever followed his guidance but it ended well.</body></html>
