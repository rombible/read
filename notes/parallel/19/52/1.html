The order of the Hebrew is, however, against this, and in favour of the English, <span class= "ital">why dost thou exult in wickedness, O hero, i.e., </span>perhaps, not only his own, but in the wickedness the people are led into by his means. This seems necessitated by the next clause.

The position would be a high one, and would imply the possession of much physical strength. A sense of tyranny or extreme arrogance seems to attach to the word translated "mighty one" (<span class="accented">gibber</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-8.htm">Genesis 10:8</a>. The word translated "mischief" implies something worse. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a> it is rendered "wickedness," and is thought to mean, in the Psalms generally, "ruinous, unfathomable evil - destructive malignity" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">The goodness of God endureth continually</span>. Why not follow the Divine pattern, instead of setting thyself in direct antagonism to it? Canst thou expect to prosper when thou art thus opposed to the Almighty? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/52.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>52:1-5 Those that glory in sin, glory in their shame. The patience and forbearance of God are abused by sinners, to the hardening of their hearts in their wicked ways. But the enemies in vain boast in their mischief, while we have God's mercy to trust in. It will not save us from the guilt of lying, to be able to say, there was some truth in what we said, if we make it appear otherwise than it was. The more there is of craft and contrivance in any wickedness, the more there is of Satan in it. When good men die, they are transplanted from the land of the living on earth, to heaven, the garden of the Lord, where they shall take root for ever; but when wicked men die, they are rooted out, to perish for ever. The believer sees that God will destroy those who make not him their strength.</body></html>
