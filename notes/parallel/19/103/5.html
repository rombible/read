The word there adopted ("trappings," or "ornaments") would Commend itself here, from the evident allusion in the next clause to the moulting of the bird, and its appearance in new plumage, if the expression "to satisfy ornament with good" were in any way intelligible. The LXX. and Vulg. have "desire; the Syriac "body;" but the Chaldee, "age," which is supported (Gesenius) by the derivation, gives the best sense:--<p>Who satisfleth thine age with good, so that<p>Thy youth renews itself like the eagle.<p><span class= "bld">The eagle's.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">nesher; </span>properly, the <span class= "ital">griffon, </span>or <span class= "ital">great vulture. </span>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm" title="You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.">Exodus 19:4</a>; and Note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm" title="Though you exalt yourself as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, there will I bring you down, said the LORD.">Obadiah 1:4</a>.<p>The rendering of the Prayer Book, "like the eagle's," follows the LXX. The idea that the eagle renewed its youth formed the basis of a Rabbinical story, and no doubt appears also in the myth of the Ph?nix. But the psalmist merely refers to the fresh and vigorous appearance of the bird with its new plumage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/103.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things.</span> So Dean Johnson and our Revisers. But the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> by "mouth" is very doubtful. The original meaning of the word seems to have been "gay ornament," whence it passed to "gaiety," "desire of enjoyment," "desire" generally (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, LXX.). Dr. Kay translates, "thy gay heart;" Professor Cheyne, "thy desire." God satisfies the reasonable desires of his servants, giving them "all things richly to enjoy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>), and "satisfying the desire of every living thing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-16.htm">Psalm 145:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's;</span> rather, <span class="accented">like an eagle</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>). The meaning is, not "thy youth is renewed as an eagle's youth is," for an eagle's youth is not renewed; but "thy youth is renewed, and is become in its strength like an eagle." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>103:1-5 By the pardon of sin, that is taken away which kept good things from us, and we are restored to the favor of God, who bestows good things on us. Think of the provocation; it was sin, and yet pardoned: how many the provocations, yet all pardoned! God is still forgiving, as we are still sinning and repenting. The body finds the melancholy consequences of Adam's offence, it is subject to many infirmities, and the soul also. Christ alone forgives all our sins; it is he alone who heals all our infirmities. And the person who finds his sin cured, has a well-grounded assurance that it is forgiven. When God, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, recovers his people from their decays, and fills them with new life and joy, which is to them an earnest of eternal life and joy, they may then be said to return to the days of their youth, Job 33:25.</body></html>
