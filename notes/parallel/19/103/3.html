God's forgiveness of sin is a frequent topic with the psalmists (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-11.htm">Psalm 25:11, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-9.htm">Psalm 51:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-2.htm">Psalm 85:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Who healeth all thy diseases.</span> This is best understood literally - not as mere "parallelism." Among the greatest blessings which we receive of God is recovery from sickness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>103:1-5 By the pardon of sin, that is taken away which kept good things from us, and we are restored to the favor of God, who bestows good things on us. Think of the provocation; it was sin, and yet pardoned: how many the provocations, yet all pardoned! God is still forgiving, as we are still sinning and repenting. The body finds the melancholy consequences of Adam's offence, it is subject to many infirmities, and the soul also. Christ alone forgives all our sins; it is he alone who heals all our infirmities. And the person who finds his sin cured, has a well-grounded assurance that it is forgiven. When God, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, recovers his people from their decays, and fills them with new life and joy, which is to them an earnest of eternal life and joy, they may then be said to return to the days of their youth, Job 33:25.</body></html>
