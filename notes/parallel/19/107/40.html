A direct quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-21.htm">Job 12:21</a>, but not therefore to be regarded as spurious, since the sacred writers often quote one another, and the psalmists especially are very much in the habit of citing, or referring to Job (see, in this very psalm, besides the present passage, vers. 10, 18 (<span class="accented">bis</span>), 20, 34, 41, and 42). <span class="cmt_word">And causeth them to wander in the wilderness</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-24.htm">Job 12:24</a>). Where there is <span class="cmt_word">no way</span>. "Wandering in a wilder ness without a way denotes helpless embarrassment" (Hengstenberg). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/107.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>107:33-43 What surprising changes are often made in the affairs of men! Let the present desolate state of Judea, and of other countries, explain this. If we look abroad in the world, we see many greatly increase, whose beginning was small. We see many who have thus suddenly risen, as suddenly brought to nothing. Worldly wealth is uncertain; often those who are filled with it, ere they are aware, lose it again. God has many ways of making men poor. The righteous shall rejoice. It shall fully convince all those who deny the Divine Providence. When sinners see how justly God takes away the gifts they have abused, they will not have a word to say. It is of great use to us to be fully assured of God's goodness, and duly affected with it. It is our wisdom to mind our duty, and to refer our comfort to him. A truly wise person will treasure in his heart this delightful psalm. From it, he will fully understand the weakness and wretchedness of man, and the power and loving-kindness of God, not for our merit, but for his mercy's sake.</body></html>
