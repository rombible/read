It is not only that the artistic form is dropped, and the series of vivid pictures, each closed by a refrain, succeeded by changed aspects of thought, but the language becomes harsher, and the poet, if the same, suddenly proclaims that he has exhausted his imagination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/107.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-42.</span> - Professor Cheyne finds in this passage - which he views as an "appendix" to the psalm - a falling off from the earlier portion of the psalm, and a set of "sentences strung together without much reflection." But to others the transition from special deliverances to God's general dealings with mankind seems an enlargement and an advance in the thought, although the language may be less graphic and more commonplace than in the former portion of the composition. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He turneth rivers into a wilderness</span>. God can, and does, by the operation of his providence, turn lands naturally fertile - lands abounding with streams - into arid wastes, either by such a physical catastrophe as that which blasted the cities of the plain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24, 25</a>), or by such moral changes as have turned Babylonia from a garden into a desert, a miserable howling wilderness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-15.htm">Isaiah 13:15-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-13.htm">Jeremiah 50:13-15, 38-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13, 37-43</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And the water springs into dry ground</span>. The phrase is varied, but the meaning is the same. God has full control over nature, and can either take back his blessings, or render them of no avail. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/107.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>107:33-43 What surprising changes are often made in the affairs of men! Let the present desolate state of Judea, and of other countries, explain this. If we look abroad in the world, we see many greatly increase, whose beginning was small. We see many who have thus suddenly risen, as suddenly brought to nothing. Worldly wealth is uncertain; often those who are filled with it, ere they are aware, lose it again. God has many ways of making men poor. The righteous shall rejoice. It shall fully convince all those who deny the Divine Providence. When sinners see how justly God takes away the gifts they have abused, they will not have a word to say. It is of great use to us to be fully assured of God's goodness, and duly affected with it. It is our wisdom to mind our duty, and to refer our comfort to him. A truly wise person will treasure in his heart this delightful psalm. From it, he will fully understand the weakness and wretchedness of man, and the power and loving-kindness of God, not for our merit, but for his mercy's sake.</body></html>
