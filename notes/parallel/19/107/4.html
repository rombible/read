It depends on the view we take of the poem.

Men from time to time wander - lose their way - either literally, or in the wilderness of life, grow faint and weary, and are ready to perish. But if they cry to God, God gives them aid, succors them, saves them. Then let them praise and thank him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in</span>. It is, perhaps, best to divide this verse as was done by the LXX., who attached <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5e8;&#x5da;</span>, "way," to the latter clause. So Cheyne, who translates, "They wandered in the wilderness, yea, in the desert; they found no road to a city of habitation." So also Rosenm&uuml;ller. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/107.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>107:1-9 In these verses there is reference to the deliverance from Egypt, and perhaps that from Babylon: but the circumstances of travellers in those countries are also noted. It is scarcely possible to conceive the horrors suffered by the hapless traveller, when crossing the trackless sands, exposed to the burning rays of the sum. The words describe their case whom the Lord has redeemed from the bondage of Satan; who pass through the world as a dangerous and dreary wilderness, often ready to faint through troubles, fears, and temptations. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, after God, and communion with him, shall be filled with the goodness of his house, both in grace and glory.</body></html>
