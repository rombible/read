The psalmist anticipates a favourable answer to his prayer, and proceeds to note down the chief points of it. God will "speak peace to his people" (ver. 8), bring his salvation near to them (ver. 9), contrive a way by which "mercy and truth," "righteousness and peace," shall be reconciled (vers. 10, 11), shower blessings on his land (ver. 12), and guide his people in the way marked out by his own footsteps (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will hear what God the Lord will speak;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will wait now and hear the Divine answer to my prayers" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-1.htm">Habakkuk 3:1</a>, "I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me"). <span class="cmt_word">For he will speak peace unto his people.</span> He will give them a gentle answer - one breathing peace and loving kindness. <span class="cmt_word">And to his saints.</span> And especially he will so answer the <span class="accented">elite</span> of his people - the <span class="accented">khasidim</span>, "his saints," or "loving ones." <span class="cmt_word">But let them not turn again to folly</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10-14</a>). If, after the deliverance that they had experienced, they turned again to such "folly" as had brought on their misfortunes, it would make their end worse than their beginning. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/85.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>85:8-13 Sooner or later, God will speak peace to his people. If he do not command outward peace, yet he will suggest inward peace; speaking to their hearts by his Spirit. Peace is spoken only to those who turn from sin. All sin is folly, especially backsliding; it is the greatest folly to return to sin. Surely God's salvation is nigh, whatever our difficulties and distresses are. Also, his honour is secured, that glory may dwell in our land. And the truth of the promises is shown by the Divine mercy in sending the Redeemer. The Divine justice is now satisfied by the great atonement. Christ, the way, truth, and life, sprang out of the earth when he took our nature upon him, and Divine justice looked upon him well pleased and satisfied. For his sake all good things, especially his Holy Spirit, are given to those who ask him. Through Christ, the pardoned sinner becomes fruitful in good works, and by looking to and trusting in the Saviour's righteousness, finds his feet set in the way of his steps. Righteousness is a sure guide, both in meeting God, and in following him</body></html>
