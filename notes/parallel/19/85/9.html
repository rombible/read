(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-16.htm" title="Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.">Isaiah 32:16</a> <span class= "ital">seq., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-8.htm" title="Drop down, you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.">Isaiah 45:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-14.htm" title="And judgment is turned away backward, and justice stands afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.">Isaiah 59:14</a>.) It is an allegory of completed national happiness, which, though presented in language peculiar to Hebrew thought, is none the less universal in its application. Nor does it stop at material blessings, but lends itself to the expression of the highest truths. The poet sees once more the <span class= "ital">glory </span>which had so long deserted the land come back--as its symbol, the ark, once came back--and take up its abode there. He sees the covenant <span class= "ital">favour </span>once more descend and meet the divine <span class= "ital">faithfulness </span>of which, lately, perplexed minds were doubting, but which the return of prosperity has now proved sure. Righteousness and peace, or prosperity, these inseparable brothers, kiss each other, and fall lovingly into each other's arms.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/85.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him;</span> or, <span class="accented">will be nigh.</span> The answer to the prayer in ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">That glory may dwell in our land</span>. Professor Chevne asks, "What glory?" and suggests, "The true Shechinah, the manifested presence of Israel's God." But it may be doubtful whether anything more is meant than a return of earthly glory and prosperity, such as that for which Nehemiah laboured and prayed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/85.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>85:8-13 Sooner or later, God will speak peace to his people. If he do not command outward peace, yet he will suggest inward peace; speaking to their hearts by his Spirit. Peace is spoken only to those who turn from sin. All sin is folly, especially backsliding; it is the greatest folly to return to sin. Surely God's salvation is nigh, whatever our difficulties and distresses are. Also, his honour is secured, that glory may dwell in our land. And the truth of the promises is shown by the Divine mercy in sending the Redeemer. The Divine justice is now satisfied by the great atonement. Christ, the way, truth, and life, sprang out of the earth when he took our nature upon him, and Divine justice looked upon him well pleased and satisfied. For his sake all good things, especially his Holy Spirit, are given to those who ask him. Through Christ, the pardoned sinner becomes fruitful in good works, and by looking to and trusting in the Saviour's righteousness, finds his feet set in the way of his steps. Righteousness is a sure guide, both in meeting God, and in following him</body></html>
