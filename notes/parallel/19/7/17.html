God is identified with his Name very commonly in Scripture, or, perhaps we should say, the Name of God is used as a periphrasis for God himself. Where God puts his special presence, he is said to "put his Name" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 21</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>). His Name is "holy and reverend" (Psalm 111:19); "incense is offered unto it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>); it is "magnified for ever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-24.htm">1 Chronicles 17:24</a>); for it the temple is built (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-44.htm">1 Kings 8:44</a>); through it the godly "tread down their enemies" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>); the "desire of men's souls is to it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>).

The destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described, ver. 14-16, as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.</body></html>
