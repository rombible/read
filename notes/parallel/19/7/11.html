And God is angry with the wicked every day. There is no need of inserting the words, "with the wicked," since, <span class="accented">of</span> course, it is with the wicked that God is angry. What the psalmist means to assert especially is that God's anger continues against the wicked as long as their wickedness continues. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:10-17 David is confident that he shall find God his powerful Saviour. The destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described, ver. 14-16, as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.</body></html>
