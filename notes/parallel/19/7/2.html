Such a change from plural to singular often occurs in the Psalms. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/41-5.htm" title="My enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?">Psalm 41:5-6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Rending it in pieces.</span>--The LXX., followed by the Vulg. (so too the Syriac), take the verb in its primitive sense of "snatch away," and translate, "there being none to redeem or deliver." So Milton: "Tearing, and no rescue nigh." Notice the comparison of human enemies to beasts of prey--a reminiscence of the lion and the bear of his youth, so constantly present to David. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-7.htm" title="Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for you have smitten all my enemies on the cheek bone; you have broken the teeth of the ungodly.">Psalm 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-37.htm" title="David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the LORD be with you.">1Samuel 17:37</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest he tear my soul like a lion</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-6.htm">Psalm 5:6</a>, where there is a similar abrupt transition from the plural to the singular number). On both occasions David fears one special enemy - then probably Ahithophel, now Saul. The simile of the lion is one frequent in the Psalms (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-9.htm">Psalm 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-4.htm">Psalm 54:4</a>, etc.). Rending it in pieces. As the lion does a sheep. While there is none to deliver. No human helper, at once willing and able to give deliverance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 David flees to God for succour. But Christ alone could call on Heaven to attest his uprightness in all things. All His works were wrought in righteousness; and the prince of this world found nothing whereof justly to accuse him. Yet for our sakes, submitting to be charged as guilty, he suffered all evils, but, being innocent, he triumphed over them all. The plea is, For the righteous God trieth the hearts and the reins. He knows the secret wickedness of the wicked, and how to bring it to an end; he is witness to the secret sincerity of the just, and has ways of establishing it. When a man has made peace with God about all his sins, upon the terms of grace and mercy, through the sacrifice of the Mediator, he may, in comparison with his enemies, appeal to God's justice to decide.</body></html>
