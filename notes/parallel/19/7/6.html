To call on God to "arise" is to ask him to take action, to lay aside the neutral attitude in which he most commonly shows himself to man, and to interfere openly in the concerns of earth. To call on him to "arise in <span class="accented">his anger"</span> is to entreat him to vindicate our cause against those opposed in us, and to visit them with some open manifestation of his displeasure (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-26.htm">Psalm 44:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-1.htm">Psalm 68:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lift up thyself</span>.

And awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.</span> The two clauses are not connected in the original, which runs, "Awake for me: thou hast commanded judgment." The meaning seems to be, "Arouse thyself on my behalf - judgment is a thing which thou hast ordained - surely now is the time for it." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 David flees to God for succour. But Christ alone could call on Heaven to attest his uprightness in all things. All His works were wrought in righteousness; and the prince of this world found nothing whereof justly to accuse him. Yet for our sakes, submitting to be charged as guilty, he suffered all evils, but, being innocent, he triumphed over them all. The plea is, For the righteous God trieth the hearts and the reins. He knows the secret wickedness of the wicked, and how to bring it to an end; he is witness to the secret sincerity of the just, and has ways of establishing it. When a man has made peace with God about all his sins, upon the terms of grace and mercy, through the sacrifice of the Mediator, he may, in comparison with his enemies, appeal to God's justice to decide.</body></html>
