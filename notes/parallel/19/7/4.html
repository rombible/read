From metrical reasons, and also to avoid the abruptness of the change of construction, Ewald conjectures that two clauses have dropped out of the text, and restores as follows--<p>"If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me<p>(And cunning unto him that was at peace with me,<p>Yea, if I have not rewarded his soul with good).<p>And delivered him that without cause is my enemy."<p>Milton's translation gives yet another colour to the passage--<p>"If I have wrought<p>Ill to him that meant me peace,<p>Or to him have rendered less,<p>And not freed my foe for nought."<p>The conjecture of a corruption of the text is supported by the rendering of the LXX. and Vulg., and a very slight change gives the probable rendering: "If I have returned evil to him that dealt friendly with me, and injured my enemy without cause."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me</span>. This is probably the true meaning. David denies that he has wantonly attacked and injured any one with whom he was on friendly and peaceable terms. No doubt he was accused of having estranged Saul by plotting to take the crown from him<span class="cmt_word">. (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy.)</span> This translation, which is retained by our Revisers, has the support also of Ewald, Hupfeld, Mr. Aglen, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.' If accepted, it must be considered as a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-7.htm">1 Samuel 24:7</a>, or else to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>, or both, and as a sort of parenthetic protest, "Nay, not only have I not injured a friend, but I have gone so far as to let my enemy escape me." A different meaning is, however, given to the passage by many critics, as Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Cheyne, etc., who regard the sense as running on without any parenthesis, and translate, "If I have oppressed him who without cause is mine enemy." David, according to this view, denies that he has either injured a friend or requited evil to a foe. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 David flees to God for succour. But Christ alone could call on Heaven to attest his uprightness in all things. All His works were wrought in righteousness; and the prince of this world found nothing whereof justly to accuse him. Yet for our sakes, submitting to be charged as guilty, he suffered all evils, but, being innocent, he triumphed over them all. The plea is, For the righteous God trieth the hearts and the reins. He knows the secret wickedness of the wicked, and how to bring it to an end; he is witness to the secret sincerity of the just, and has ways of establishing it. When a man has made peace with God about all his sins, upon the terms of grace and mercy, through the sacrifice of the Mediator, he may, in comparison with his enemies, appeal to God's justice to decide.</body></html>
