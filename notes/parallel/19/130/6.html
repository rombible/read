In the "watcher for the dawn" there may be an allusion to the Levite-sentinel whose duty it was to signal the first ray of dawn, and the moment for commencing the sacred rites of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm" title="Behold, bless you the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.">Psalm 134:1</a>), but the figure if general, as marking the impatience of a deeply agitated soul--a sufferer waiting for relief, a contrite sinner for forgiveness--is as striking as graceful. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-67.htm" title="In the morning you shall say, Would God it were even! and at even you shall say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of your heart with which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.">Deuteronomy 28:67</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/130.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning</span>: I say, more than they that <span class="cmt_word">watch for the morning</span>; i.e. more eagerly, more anxiously, than even the night watchman, tired with his long vigil. Again the repetition adds force. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/130.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>130:5-8 It is for the Lord that my soul waits, for the gifts of his grace, and the working of his power. We must hope for that only which he has promised in his word. Like those who wish to see the dawn, being very desirous that light would come long before day; but still more earnestly does a good man long for the tokens of God's favour, and the visits of his grace. Let all that devote themselves to the Lord, cheerfully stay themselves on him. This redemption is redemption from all sin. Jesus Christ saves his people from their sins, both from the condemning and from the commanding power of sin. It is plenteous redemption; there is an all-sufficient fulness in the Redeemer, enough for all, enough for each; therefore enough for me, says the believer. Redemption from sin includes redemption from all other evils, therefore it is a plenteous redemption, through the atoning blood of Jesus, who shall redeem his people from all their sins. All that wait on God for mercy and grace, are sure to have peace.</body></html>
