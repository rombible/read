If "Jah" were to watch for men's lapses, as one watches for the dawn, nothing but signal punishment could follow. So Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-14.htm" title="If I sin, then you mark me, and you will not acquit me from my iniquity.">Job 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-16.htm" title="For now you number my steps: do you not watch over my sin?">Job 14:16</a>) actually believed God did watch; while the prophets Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm" title="Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end?

Many things present themselves as diversions, many things offer themselves as remedies, but the soul finds that the Lord alone can heal. And until men are sensible of the guilt of sin, and quit all to come at once to God, it is in vain for them to expect any relief. The Holy Ghost gives to such poor souls a fresh sense of their deep necessity, to stir them up in earnest applications, by the prayer of faith, by crying to God. And as they love their souls, as they are concerned for the glory of the Lord, they are not to be wanting in this duty. Why is it that these matters are so long uncertain with them? Is it not from sloth and despondency that they content themselves with common and customary applications to God? Then let us up and be doing; it must be done, and it is attended with safety. We are to humble ourselves before God, as guilty in his sight. Let us acknowledge our sinfulness; we cannot justify ourselves, or plead not guilty. It is our unspeakable comfort that there is forgiveness with him, for that is what we need. Jesus Christ is the great Ransom; he is ever an Advocate for us, and through him we hope to obtain forgiveness. There is forgiveness with thee, not that thou mayest be presumed upon, but that thou mayest be feared. The fear of God often is put for the whole worship of God. The only motive and encouragement for sinners is this, that there is forgiveness with the Lord.</body></html>
