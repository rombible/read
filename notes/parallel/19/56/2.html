In many passages where it is used the meaning given here by the LXX., "trample on," will suit the context quite as well as, or even better than, the meaning, "pant after," given in the Lexicons. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm" title="Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallows up their substance.">Job 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-14.htm" title="I have long time held my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.">Isaiah 42:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-5.htm" title="The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to his place where he arose.">Ecclesiastes 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-7.htm" title="That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in to the same maid, to profane my holy name:">Amos 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-4.htm" title="Hear this, O you that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,">Amos 8:4</a>.) And this sense of bruising by trampling also suits the cognate verb, <span class= "ital">sh-ph, </span>used only three times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm" title="For he breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.">Job 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-11.htm" title="If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.">Psalm 139:11</a>). Symmachus also here has "bruise," or "grind." On the other hand in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-131.htm" title="I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for your commandments.">Psalm 119:131</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-2.htm" title="As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as an hireling looks for the reward of his work:">Job 7:2</a>, &c, we want the idea of "haste" or "desire." Possibly the original meaning of "trample" may have passed through the sense of physical haste to that of passion. Or we may even get the sense of "greedily devouring" by the exactly similar process by which we come to talk of devouring the road with speed. The same verb is used in the next verse with an object.<p><span class= "bld">Fighting.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">devouring. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-1.htm" title="Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.">Psalm 35:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">O thou most High.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">marom, </span>which is here not a vocative, but an adverbial accusative, "proudly," in pride.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine enemies</span>; literally, <span class="accented">my watchers</span> - those who keep a continual guard over me. If David had been seized and made a prisoner by the Philistine lords, this expression would be very appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Would daily swallow me up;</span> rather, pant <span class="accented">after me all day. <span class="cmt_word"></span>For they be many that fight against me.</span> The "lords of the Philistines" were, doubtless, "many;" they seem to have, all of them, opposed themselves to David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2-9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">O thou Most High.</span> This rendering is now generally abandoned, since <span class="accented">marom</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>), "height," is nowhere else used in this sense. Dr. Kay, Hengstenberg, and the Revised Version render "proudly;" Professor Cheyne, "with high looks." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/56.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>56:1-7 Be merciful unto me, O God. This petition includes all the good for which we come to throne of grace. If we obtain mercy there, we need no more to make us happy. It implies likewise our best plea, not our merit, but God's mercy, his free, rich mercy. We may flee to, and trust the mercy of God, when surrounded on all sides by difficulties and dangers. His enemies were too hard for him, if God did not help him. He resolves to make God's promises the matter of his praises, and so we have reason to make them. As we must not trust an arm of flesh when engaged for us, so we must not be afraid of an arm of flesh when stretched out against us. The sin of sinners will never be their security. Who knows the power of God's anger; how high it can reach, how forcibly it can strike?</body></html>
