The vague and general expression, "ends of the earth," which takes the place of the definite "desert," in the passage of Exodus, makes in favour of the latter view. So, too, do the hyperbolic expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm" title="They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.">Psalm 72:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-11.htm" title="Yes, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.">Psalm 72:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm" title="His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.">Psalm 72:17</a>.

The same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm" title="And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace to the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.">Zechariah 9:10</a> describes the Messianic kingdom, and is certainly poetical, but whether that or this passage is the original is doubtful.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/72.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall have dominion also from sea to sea.</span> It does not appear that any particular seas are meant, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3, 6</a>; rather, the idea is that the earth is set in the midst of the sea, and that Messiah's dominion will reach from shore to shore. <span class="cmt_word">And from the river</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Euphrates) <span class="cmt_word">unto the ends of the earth.</span> Israel's promised dominion extended only as far as the great river (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), which was also the boundary of Solomon's kingdom eastward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>); Messiah's was to reach indefinitely beyond the river to the world's end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/72.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>72:2-17 This is a prophecy of the kingdom of Christ; many passages in it cannot be applied to the reign of Solomon. There were righteousness and peace at first in the administration of his government; but, before the end of his reign, there were troubles and unrighteousness. The kingdom here spoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon at an end. Even the Jewish expositors understood it of the kingdom of the Messiah. Observe many great and precious promises here made, which were to have full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ. As far as his kingdom is set up, discord and contentions cease, in families, churches, and nations. The law of Christ, written in the heart, disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all their due; it likewise disposes men to live in love, and so produces abundance of peace. Holiness and love shall be lasting in Christ's kingdom. Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, Christ's kingdom will support itself. And he shall, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, come down like rain upon the mown grass; not on that cut down, but that which is left growing, that it may spring again. His gospel has been, or shall be, preached to all nations. Though he needs not the services of any, yet he must be served with the best. Those that have the wealth of this world, must serve Christ with it, do good with it. Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatever we ask of the Father, should be in his name. Praises shall be offered to him: we are under the highest obligations to him. Christ only shall be feared throughout all generations. To the end of time, and to eternity, his name shall be praised. All nations shall call HIM blessed.</body></html>
