With regard to the meaning of the words we are placed on <span class= "ital">practical </span>ground; they refer to the faculty of judging in affairs of government, of coming to a great and fair decision. In fact, whether Solomon be the intended subject of the poem or not, the prayer made in his dream at Gibeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-9.htm" title="Give therefore your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this your so great a people?">1Kings 3:9</a>) is the best comment on these verses. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm" title="Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.">Isaiah 32:1</a>.)<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The king . . . the king's son.</span>--The article is wanting in the Hebrew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/72.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.</span> God had established in Israel, in the person of David, hereditary monarchy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), such as was usual in the East, and suited to Oriental notions. In speaking of himself, not only as "the king," but also as "the king's son," Solomon makes appeal to the sentiment of respect for hereditary royalty. Compare the inscription of Mesha, "My father was king over Moab thirty years, and I became king after my father" (line 1). In praying God to give him "his judgments," he is desiring a "spirit of judgment" which will enable him to deliver decisions as righteous as God's. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/72.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>72:1 This psalm belongs to Solomon in part, but to Christ more fully and clearly. Solomon was both the king and the king's son, and his pious father desired that the wisdom of God might be in him, that his reign might be a remembrance of the kingdom of the Messiah. It is the prayer of a father for his child; a dying blessing. The best we can ask of God for our children is, that God would give them wisdom and grace to know and to do their duty.</body></html>
