And that event may indeed have supplied the figure, but a figure for the dispersal of a <span class= "ital">land army. </span>We may render:<p>With a blast from the east<p>Thou breakest (them as) Tarshish ships.<p>Or,<p>With a blast from the east<p>(Which) breaketh Tarshish ships (thou breakest them),<p>according as we take the verb, second person masculine, or third person feminine.<p>Shakespeare, in <span class= "ital">King John, </span>compares the rout of an army to the dispersion of a fleet--<p>"So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,<p>A whole Armada of convicted sail<p>Is scattered and disjoined from fellowship."<p>This is preferable to the suggestion that the seaboard tribes were in the alliance, whose break-up the psalm seems to commemorate, and that the sudden dispersion of their Armada ruined the enterprise. Tarshish ships, a common term for large merchantmen (comp. <span class= "ital">East Indiamen</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>from their use in the Tarshish trade, are here symbols of a powerful empire. Isaiah, in Isaiah 33, compares Assyria to a gallant ship. For the "east wind," proverbially destructive and injurious, and so a ready weapon of chastisement in the Divine hand, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-21.htm" title="The east wind carries him away, and he departs: and as a storm hurles him out of his place.">Job 27:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-8.htm" title="In measure, when it shoots forth, you will debate with it: he stays his rough wind in the day of the east wind.">Isaiah 27:8</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm" title="Your rowers have brought you into great waters: the east wind has broken you in the middle of the seas.">Ezekiel 27:26</a>, where its harm to shipping is especially mentioned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind</span>. The literal exposition is wholly out of place, since history does not speak of any co-operation of a fleet with a land army in any attack upon Pales. fine. The expression must be used metaphorically of a great and violent destruction wrought by the arm of God upon Israel's foes. Still, the imagery would scarcely have been used, unless there had been something in the circumstances of the time to suggest it, as there certainly was in Jehoshaphat's time, whose fleet of "ships of Tamhish" was "broken" at Ezion-geber (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>). The poet may have witnessed the catastrophe. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-7 Jerusalem is the city of our God: none on earth render him due honour except the citizens of the spiritual Jerusalem. Happy the kingdom, the city, the family, the heart, in which God is great, in which he is all. There God is known. The clearer discoveries are made to us of the Lord and his greatness, the more it is expected that we should abound in his praises. The earth is, by sin, covered with deformity, therefore justly might that spot of ground, which was beautified with holiness, be called the joy of the whole earth; that which the whole earth has reason to rejoice in, that God would thus in very deed dwell with man upon the earth. The kings of the earth were afraid of it. Nothing in nature can more fitly represent the overthrow of heathenism by the Spirit of the gospel, than the wreck of a fleet in a storm. Both are by the mighty power of the Lord.</body></html>
