In his annals, as lately deciphered, this monarch speaks of setting up tributary kings or viceroys in Chaldaea, Phoenicia, and Philistia, after conquering these countries. (See <span class= "ital">Assyrian Discoveries, </span>by George Smith, p. 303.) Others again, referring the psalm to the time of Ahaz, understand Pekah and Rezin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-37.htm" title="In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.">2Kings 15:37</a>).

Some see in these "kings" Sennacherib's princes, who, according to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>), were "altogether kings." But actual monarchs, each leading his own army, seem rather to be intended. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-7 Jerusalem is the city of our God: none on earth render him due honour except the citizens of the spiritual Jerusalem. Happy the kingdom, the city, the family, the heart, in which God is great, in which he is all. There God is known. The clearer discoveries are made to us of the Lord and his greatness, the more it is expected that we should abound in his praises. The earth is, by sin, covered with deformity, therefore justly might that spot of ground, which was beautified with holiness, be called the joy of the whole earth; that which the whole earth has reason to rejoice in, that God would thus in very deed dwell with man upon the earth. The kings of the earth were afraid of it. Nothing in nature can more fitly represent the overthrow of heathenism by the Spirit of the gospel, than the wreck of a fleet in a storm. Both are by the mighty power of the Lord.</body></html>
