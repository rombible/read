"Jerusalem, above all other great capitals," says Professor Cheyne, "is a mountain city." "It is a glorious burst," says Canon Tristram, "as the traveller rounds the shoulder of Mount Olivet, and the Haram wall starts up before him from the deep gorge of the Kedron, with its domes and crescents sparkling in the sunlight - a royal city" ('Land of Israel,' pp. 111, 112). <span class="cmt_word">The joy of the whole earth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">is</span> <span class="cmt_word">Mount Zion</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>). The psalmist writes as a devout Israelite. To him there is nothing in the world so lovely, nothing so gladdening, as Mount Zion and the holy city seated on it. He does not mean to say that all the earth felt as he did; though he may have thought that, if men were wise, they would so feel. <span class="cmt_word">On the sides of the north</span>. Professor Cheyne regards this clause as a gloss which has crept into the text. Others give a mystical interpretation founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>. But the simplest explanation seems to be the best. Zion, the city of David, lay to the north of the temple, and abutted on the city's northern wall. <span class="cmt_word">The city of the great King</span> (comp. ver. 1, "the city of our God"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/48.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>48:1-7 Jerusalem is the city of our God: none on earth render him due honour except the citizens of the spiritual Jerusalem. Happy the kingdom, the city, the family, the heart, in which God is great, in which he is all. There God is known. The clearer discoveries are made to us of the Lord and his greatness, the more it is expected that we should abound in his praises. The earth is, by sin, covered with deformity, therefore justly might that spot of ground, which was beautified with holiness, be called the joy of the whole earth; that which the whole earth has reason to rejoice in, that God would thus in very deed dwell with man upon the earth. The kings of the earth were afraid of it. Nothing in nature can more fitly represent the overthrow of heathenism by the Spirit of the gospel, than the wreck of a fleet in a storm. Both are by the mighty power of the Lord.</body></html>
