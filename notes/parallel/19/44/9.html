God has recently dealt with Israel exceptionally - has seemed to "cast them off," has "put them to shame," allowed them to be defeated and despoiled, slain and carried into captivity, made a scorn and a derision, a reproach and a byword. He no longer "goes forth with their armies," to secure them victory over their foes, but holds aloof, and covers them with confusion. The description implies, not a single defeat, but a somewhat prolonged period of depression, during which several "armies" have been beaten, several battles lost, multitudes slain, and great numbers carried away captive (ver. 11). Still, a general captivity, like the Babylonian, is certainly not spoken cf. The nation is as yet unconquered. It needs but a return of God's favour to turn the vanquished into the victors, and to replace shame by boasting. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">cast off</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a>) <span class="cmt_word">and put us to shame</span> (see also ver. 16). It is the <span class="accented">shame</span> of defeat, rather than the physical pains or material losses, that grieve the writer<span class="cmt_word">. And goest not forth with our armies</span>. Israel has still "armies" at her disposal. It is therefore certainly not the early Maccabean period, nor the time of the expiring monarchy. Her armies have free play, are sent forth, only God does not "go forth" with them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-10.htm">Psalm 60:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:9-16 The believer must have times of temptation, affliction, and discouragement; the church must have seasons of persecution. At such times the people of God will be ready to fear that he has cast them off, and that his name and truth will be dishonoured. But they should look above the instruments of their trouble, to God, well knowing that their worst enemies have no power against them, but what is permitted from above.</body></html>
