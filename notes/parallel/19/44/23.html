God has always hitherto maintained the cause of his people, and given them victory over their enemies, unless they had fallen away from him (vers. 1-8). Now he has acted otherwise - he has allowed their enemies to triumph (vers. 9-16). And they have given him no reason for his desertion of them (vers. 17-22). Surely, if they call upon him, and plead their cause before him, he will relent, and come to their aid. The appeal, therefore, is made briefly, but in the most moving terms. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?</span> The psalmist does not really believe that Jehovah "sleeps." The heathen might so imagine of their gods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>), but not an Israelite. An Israelite would be sure that "he that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>). The writer consciously uses an anthropomorphism, really intending only to call on God to rouse himself from his inaction, and lay it aside, and come to Israel's aid. <span class="cmt_word">Arise</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Cast us not off for ever</span> (comp. ver. 9). Under the existing peril, for God to cast off his people will be to cast them off <span class="accented">for ever.</span> They had no strength of their own that could save them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/44.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>44:17-26 In afflictions, we must not seek relief by any sinful compliance; but should continually meditate on the truth, purity, and knowledge of our heart-searching God. Hearts sins and secret sins are known to God, and must be reckoned for. He knows the secret of the heart, therefore judges of the words and actions. While our troubles do not drive us from our duty to God, we should not suffer them to drive us from our comfort in God. Let us take care that prosperity and ease do not render us careless and lukewarm. The church of God cannot be prevailed on by persecution to forget God; the believer's heart does not turn back from God. The Spirit of prophecy had reference to those who suffered unto death, for the testimony of Christ. Observe the pleas used, ver. 25,26. Not their own merit and righteousness, but the poor sinner's pleas. None that belong to Christ shall be cast off, but every one of them shall be saved, and that for ever. The mercy of God, purchased, promised, and constantly flowing forth, and offered to believers, does away every doubt arising from our sins; while we pray in faith, Redeem us for thy mercies' sake.</body></html>
