When a nation sins, it is delivered over to its enemies, partly for punishment, partly to lead it to repentance. Israel was delivered into the hand, first, of Mesopotamia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>), then of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>), next of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>), then of the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>), later on of Midian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>), still later of Ammon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7-18</a>), and then of the Philistines once more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>) - on each occasion because of some flagrant sins, and suffered chastisement until it repented. So we are told in Chronicles with respect to the invasions of Shishak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-5</a>), of Pul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-25.htm">1 Chronicles 5:25, 26</a>), of Tiglath-pileser (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19, 20</a>), and of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13-17</a>), that they were on account of the people's transgressions. God "slew" them that they might "seek him," and the ordinary result was, that they "turned themselves, and inquired after God." And they that hated them ruled over them. Chushan-rishathaim for eight years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8</a>), Eglon for eighteen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-14.htm">Judges 3:14</a>), Jabin for twenty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>), the Midianites for seven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>), the Ammonites for eighteen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-8.htm">Judges 10:8</a>), the Philistines for forty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>106:34-48 The conduct of the Israelites in Canaan, and God's dealings with them, show that the way of sin is down-hill; omissions make way for commissions: when they neglected to destroy the heathen, they learned their works. One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of God on them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his people for his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful nature and love to his people, makes him change the course of justice into mercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case is awful when the outward church is considered. When nations professing Christianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord brings them low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance, there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalm concludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people, and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people of the earth, ere long, add their Amen.</body></html>
