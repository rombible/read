The precise date of its first appearance cannot be ascertained. The chronicler includes it in the compilation from different psalms, which he introduces as sung when the Ark was brought to Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-34.htm" title="O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.">1Chronicles 16:34</a>): and represents it not only as chanted by the procession of priests and Levites, but as bursting spontaneously from the lips of the assembled multitudes at the dedication of Solomon's Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-3.htm" title="And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD on the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.">2Chronicles 7:3</a>). He mentions it also in connection with Jehoshaphat's revival of choral music. And it is probable that he was not guilty of any great anachronism in giving it this early existence; for Jeremiah speaks of it as a refrain as familiar as those customary at weddings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm" title="The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 33:11</a>), and, indeed, foretells its revival as of a practice once common, but long disused. But the fact that it is found in four liturgical hymns, besides Psalms 136, where it becomes a refrain after every verse, as well <span class= "ital">as </span>its express mention in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-11.htm" title="And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endures for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.">Ezra 3:11</a> as used at the dedication of the second Temple, shows that its use became more general after the Captivity; and it was in use in the Maccabaean period (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-24.htm" title="After this they went home, and sung a song of thanksgiving, and praised the Lord in heaven: because it is good, because his mercy endureth forever.">1 Maccabees 4:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/106.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Praise ye the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-35.htm">Psalm 104:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-45.htm">Psalm 105:45</a>). <span class="cmt_word">O give thanks unto the Lord</span> (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1</a>). Even in their greatest afflictions, the Israelites were bound to give God thanks. His mercies always exceeded his punishments. <span class="cmt_word">For he is</span> <span class="cmt_word">good</span> (see the comment on Psalm 100:5). <span class="cmt_word">For his mercy eudureth forever.</span> According to Chronicles, this phrase was used at the dedication of David's tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-34.htm">1 Chronicles 16:34, 41</a>), and again at the dedication of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>).

God's people have reason to be cheerful people; and need not envy the children of men their pleasure or pride.</body></html>
