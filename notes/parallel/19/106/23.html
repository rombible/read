So the LXX. seem to have understood the passage, since they render here by the same word, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-30.htm" title="Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.">Psalm 106:30</a> does duty for "plague." (Comp. Vulg., <span class= "ital">refractio</span>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/106.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he said that he would destroy them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and he said.</span> On the apostasy at Sinai, God expressed to Moses an intention to destroy the entire people of Israel, save only himself, and to "make of him a great nation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm">Deuteronomy 9:14, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Had not Moses his chosen steed before him in the breach.</span> Moses was "chosen" by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>), and forced to accept the office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-1.htm">Exodus 4:1-17</a>). When Israel angered God at Sinai, he "stood in the gap," like a brave soldier guarding his city when the enemy has breached the wall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13, 31-34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</span> God was ready to have destroyed all Israel, and to have raised up a new Israel out of the descendants of Moses, had not Moses pleaded with extreme earnestness on the people's behalf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>106:13-33 Those that will not wait for God's counsel, shall justly be given up to their own hearts' lusts, to walk in their own counsels. An undue desire, even for lawful things, becomes sinful. God showed his displeasure for this. He filled them with uneasiness of mind, terror of conscience, and self-reproach. Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are healthful, have leanness in their souls: no love to God, no thankfulness, no appetite for the Bread of life, and then the soul must be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves, that feast their bodies and starve their souls. Even the true believer will see abundant cause to say, It is of the Lord's mercies that I am not consumed. Often have we set up idols in our hearts, cleaved to some forbidden object; so that if a greater than Moses had not stood to turn away the anger of the Lord, we should have been destroyed. If God dealt severely with Moses for unadvised words, what do those deserve who speak many proud and wicked words? It is just in God to remove those relations that are blessings to us, when we are peevish and provoking to them, and grieve their spirits.</body></html>
