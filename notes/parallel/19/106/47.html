"It can scarcely be doubted," as Dean Johnson well observes, "that the words of ver. 47 refer to deliverance from the Babylonish captivity," which was the only one that involved the dispersion of the whole people, and the suspension of the liturgical offering of thanks and praise. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Save us, O Lord our God.</span> Contrast with this the "remember me" of ver. 4. The review of the national history has quickened the psalmist's sympathies and widened them. Previously he prayed only for himself. Now it will not content him unless the people generally are "saved." <span class="cmt_word">And gather us from among the heathen.</span> (On the wide dispersion of the Israelites at the time of the Babylonian captivity, see the comment on ver. 27.) <span class="cmt_word">To give thanks unto thy holy Name, and to triumph in thy praise.</span> This is spoken of as the consequence of the gathering together. Dispersion could not, of course, prevent the rendering of praise and thanks by individual Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>); but it had stopped the united liturgical expression of them. On the restoration of the Israelites to their own land, this was resumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2-11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>106:34-48 The conduct of the Israelites in Canaan, and God's dealings with them, show that the way of sin is down-hill; omissions make way for commissions: when they neglected to destroy the heathen, they learned their works. One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of God on them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his people for his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful nature and love to his people, makes him change the course of justice into mercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case is awful when the outward church is considered. When nations professing Christianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord brings them low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance, there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalm concludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people, and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people of the earth, ere long, add their Amen.</body></html>
