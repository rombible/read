Israel, once comfortably settled in Palestine, with sufficient room for its numbers, did not carry out the Divine command to "destroy," or "cast out," the Canaanitish nations, but was content to share the land with them. "The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>); "neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns; nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>); "neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>); nor "Zebulon the inhabitants of Kitten, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>); "neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>); nor "Naphtali the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-33.htm">Judges 1:33</a>); nor Dan the Amorites, who "would dwell in Mount Heros in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a>). It was not compassion that restrained them, but love of ease, idleness, one of the seven deadly sins; and the results were those described in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>106:34-48 The conduct of the Israelites in Canaan, and God's dealings with them, show that the way of sin is down-hill; omissions make way for commissions: when they neglected to destroy the heathen, they learned their works. One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of God on them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his people for his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful nature and love to his people, makes him change the course of justice into mercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case is awful when the outward church is considered. When nations professing Christianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord brings them low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance, there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalm concludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people, and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people of the earth, ere long, add their Amen.</body></html>
