Sic., 20:14; Dollinger, 'Judenthum und Heidenthum,' 1:427, Engl. trans.). <span class="cmt_word">Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan.</span> Bloody offerings of this horrible kind were made, not only to Moloch, but also to Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>), to Chemosh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>), and perhaps to other deities. And the land was polluted with blood. Contrary to the commandment given in Deuteronomy 35:33, "Ye shall not pollute the laud wherein ye are." The "innocent blood" shed in the land is often declared to have been the especial cause of God's anger against Israel, and of his final casting away of his inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3, 17</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>106:34-48 The conduct of the Israelites in Canaan, and God's dealings with them, show that the way of sin is down-hill; omissions make way for commissions: when they neglected to destroy the heathen, they learned their works. One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of God on them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his people for his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful nature and love to his people, makes him change the course of justice into mercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case is awful when the outward church is considered. When nations professing Christianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord brings them low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance, there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalm concludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people, and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people of the earth, ere long, add their Amen.</body></html>
