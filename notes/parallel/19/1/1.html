Literally, <span class= "ital">Blessings to the man who, </span>&c.<p><span class= "bld">Walketh . . . standeth . . . sitteth.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">went, stood, sat. </span>The good man is first described on the negative side. In the short summary of evil from which he has been saved, it is the custom of commentators to see an epitome of the whole history of sin. But the apparent gradation was a necessity of the rhythm. The three terms employed, however, for evil have distinctive significations. (1) <span class= "ital">The ungodly. </span>Properly, restless, wanting in self-control, victims of ungoverned passion, as defined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm" title="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.">Isaiah 57:20</a>. (2) <span class= "ital">Sinners. </span>General term for wrong-doers. (3) <span class= "ital">Scornful. </span>A proverbial word, defined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-24.htm" title="Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who deals in proud wrath.">Proverbs 21:24</a> : Aquila has "mockers;" Symmachus "impostors;" the LXX. "pests;" Vulgate "pest." The words expressing the <span class= "ital">conduct </span>and the <span class= "ital">career, </span>"counsel," "way," are aptly chosen, and correspond with "went," "stood." Possibly "seat" should be "assembly." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-32.htm" title="Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.">Psalm 107:32</a>.) It has an official sound, and without unduly pressing the language, we think of the graduation in vice which sometimes ends in deliberate preference for those who despise virtue. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/26-4.htm" title="I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.">Psalm 26:4-5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is the man</span>; literally, <span class="accented">blessings</span> <span class="accented">are to the man</span>. But the Authorized Version exactly gives the sense (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly</span>. The margin gives, "or wicked," and this is probably the best rendering of the word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The righteous man is first described negatively, under three heads. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> He "does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly:" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he does not throw in his lot with the wicked does not participate in their projects or designs; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> he <span class="cmt_word">standeth not in the way of sinners</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he does not take part in their actions, does not follow the same moral paths; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he <span class="cmt_word">sitteth not in the seat of the scornful</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> has no fellowship with them in the "scorn" which they cast upon religion. The word used for scornful (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span>) is Solomonian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a>), but in the Psalter occurs only in this place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 To meditate in God's word, is to discourse with ourselves concerning the great things contained in it, with close application of mind and fixedness of thought. We must have constant regard to the word of God, as the rule of our actions, and the spring of our comforts; and have it in our thoughts night and day. For this purpose no time is amiss.</body></html>
