<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm" title="The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.">Psalm 92:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-4.htm" title="And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.">Isaiah 44:4</a>; and its development in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/17-7.htm" title="Blessed is the man that trusts in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.">Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>. The full moral bearing of the image appears in our Lord's parabolic saying, "a good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit, nor an evil tree good fruit." The physical growth of a tree has in all poetry served as a ready emblem of success, as its decay has of failure. (Recall Wolsey's comment on his fall in Shakespeare's <span class= "ital">Henry VIII.</span>) Nor has the moral significance of vegetable life been ignored. "If," says a German poet, "thou wouldest attain to thy highest, go look upon a flower, and what that does unconsciously do thou consciously." In Hebrew poetry a moral purpose is given to the grass on the mountain side and the flower in the field, and we are taught that "there is not a virtue within the widest range of human conduct, not a grace set on high for man's aspiration, which has not its fitting emblem in vegetable life."--<span class= "ital">Bible Educator,</span> ii, p. 179.<p>For the general comparison of a righteous man to a tree, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm" title="Salvation belongs to the LORD: your blessing is on your people. Selah.">Psalm 3:8</a> (the olive), <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-3.htm" title="Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of your house: your children like olive plants round about your table.">Psalm 128:3</a> (vine); <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm" title="His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.">Hosea 14:6</a> (olive and cedar). Naturally the actual kind of tree in the poet's thought interests us. The oleander suggested by Dean Stanley (<span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine, </span>146), though answering the description in many ways, fails from its want of fruit to satisfy the principal condition. For, as Bishop Hall says, "Look where you will in God's Book, you shall never find any lively member of God's house, any true Christian, compared to any but <span class= "ital">a fruitful </span>tree." Probably the <span class= "ital">palm </span>meets all the conditions best. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm" title="The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.">Psalm 92:12</a>.)<p>The last clause, "Whatsoever he doeth, it shall," &c, is obscure in construction. The best rendering is, <span class= "ital">all that he doeth he maketh to prosper, </span>which may mean either "the righteous man carries out to a <span class= "ital">successful end </span>all his enterprises," or "all that he begins he brings to a maturity."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water</span>. The comparison of a man to a. tree is frequent in the Book of Job (Job 8:16, 17; 14:7-10; 15:32, 33, etc.), and occurs once in the Pentateuch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>). We find it again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-14</a>, and frequently in the prophets. The "rivers of water" spoken of (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) are undoubtedly the "streams" (Revised Version) or "canals of irrigation" so common both in Egypt and in Babylonia, by which fruit trees were planted, as especially date-palms, which need the vicinity of water. That such planting of trees by the waterside was known to the Israelites is evident, both from this passage and from several others, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5, 8</a>, etc. It is misplaced ingenuity to attempt to decide what particular tree the writer had in his mind, whether the palm, or the oleander, or any other, since he may not have been thinking of any particular tree. <span class="cmt_word">That bringeth forth his fruit in his season</span>. Therefore not the oleander, which has no fruit, and is never <span class="accented">planted</span> in the East, but grows naturally along the courses of streams. <span class="cmt_word">His leaf also shall not wither</span>. Compare the contrary threat of Isaiah against the wicked of his time, "Ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper</span>; rather, perhaps, in <span class="accented">whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 To meditate in God's word, is to discourse with ourselves concerning the great things contained in it, with close application of mind and fixedness of thought. We must have constant regard to the word of God, as the rule of our actions, and the spring of our comforts; and have it in our thoughts night and day. For this purpose no time is amiss.</body></html>
