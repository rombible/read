It is explained to refer either <span class= "ital">to </span>the rebuilding of the city and reuniting of the parts which had been disconnected in the destruction, or, which is far better (see Introduction), is taken as a rustic's impression on first seeing a compact city after being accustomed to straggling villages. The astonishment of Virgil's shepherd is aptly compared: "Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Melibaee putavi, Stultus ego, huic nostrae similem." But a far more satisfactory meaning is suggested by the LXX. They (comp. Symmachus) take the word rendered <span class= "ital">compact </span>as a noun, meaning <span class= "ital">union. </span>The verse then may run: <span class= "ital">Jerusalem, the </span>(<span class= "ital">one</span>)<span class= "ital"> built like a city, union is in it together, i.e.</span>, it is the rallying point of all the tribes. (See next verse.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/122.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Jerusalem that art builded</span>. The primary reference is probably to the compact shape and look of the ancient city, which, as Josephus says, was "one and entire," with no straggling suburbs, shut in on the north by a wall, and on the three other sides both by walls and by deep, rocky valleys. But the material "compactness" was perhaps taken to symbolize the close internal union of the inhabitants one with another, whereby they were all knit together into one Church and people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/122.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>122:1-5 The pleasure and profit from means of grace, should make us disregard trouble and fatigue in going to them; and we should quicken one another to what is good. We should desire our Christian friends, when they have any good work in hand, to call for us, and take us with them. With what readiness should we think of the heavenly Jerusalem! How cheerfully should we bear the cross and welcome death, in hopes of a crown of glory! Jerusalem is called the beautiful city. It was a type of the gospel church, which is compact together in holy love and Christian communion, so that it is all as one city. If all the disciples of Christ were of one mind, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, their enemies would be deprived of their chief advantages against them. But Satan's maxim always has been, to divide that he may conquer; and few Christians are sufficiently aware of his designs.</body></html>
