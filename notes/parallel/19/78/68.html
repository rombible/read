God, no doubt, inspired David with the thought of fixing his residence in "the stronghold of Zion" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>), and of bringing up the ark of the covenant into it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-17</a>). The presence of the ark determined the selection of Jerusalem for the site of the temple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/78.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>78:56-72 After the Israelites were settled in Canaan, the children were like their fathers. God gave them his testimonies, but they turned back. Presumptuous sins render even Israelites hateful to God's holiness, and exposed to his justice. Those whom the Lord forsakes become an easy prey to the destroyer. And sooner or later, God will disgrace his enemies. He set a good government over his people; a monarch after his own heart. With good reason does the psalmist make this finishing, crowning instance of God's favour to Israel; for David was a type of Christ, the great and good Shepherd, who was humbled first, and then exalted; and of whom it was foretold, that he should be filled with the Spirit of wisdom and understanding. On the uprightness of his heart, and the skilfulness of his hands, all his subjects may rely; and of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. Every trial of human nature hitherto, confirms the testimony of Scripture, that the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, and nothing but being created anew by the Holy Ghost can cure the ungodliness of any.</body></html>
