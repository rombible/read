But besides <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-5.htm" title="And why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.">Numbers 20:5</a> and Joseph's dream there is abundance of evidence of the extensive cultivation of the vine in Egypt. The mural paintings contain many representations of vineyards. Wine stood prominent among the offerings to the gods, and a note on a papyrus of Rameses II. speaks of rations of wine made to workmen.<p><span class= "bld">Sycamore.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm" title="And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.">1Kings 10:27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Frost.</span>--The Hebrew word is peculiar to this place. The LXX. and Vulg. have "hoar-frost," Aquila "ice," Symmachus "worm." The root of the word appears to mean <span class= "ital">to cut off, </span>so that by derivation any <span class= "ital">devastating </span>force would suit the word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/78.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He destroyed their vines with hail</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23-25</a>). Here, again, there is an inversion of the order in which the plagues came, since the plague of hail preceded that of the locusts. There is also an addition to the narrative of Exodus in the mention of "vines" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-33.htm">Psalm 105:33</a>), which may indicate a use of tradition. That vines were cultivated in Egypt is now generally acknowledged. <span class="cmt_word">And their sycamore trees with frost;</span> or, <span class="accented">with sleet</span> - a variant of the "hail" in the other hemistich. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/78.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>78:40-55. Let not those that receive mercy from God, be thereby made bold to sin, for the mercies they receive will hasten its punishment; yet let not those who are under Divine rebukes for sin, be discouraged from repentance. The Holy One of Israel will do what is most for his own glory, and what is most for their good. Their forgetting former favours, led them to limit God for the future. God made his own people to go forth like sheep; and guided them in the wilderness, as a shepherd his flock, with all care and tenderness. Thus the true Joshua, even Jesus, brings his church out of the wilderness; but no earthly Canaan, no worldly advantages, should make us forget that the church is in the wilderness while in this world, and that there remaineth a far more glorious rest for the people of God.</body></html>
