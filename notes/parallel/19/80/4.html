A form of address unusual in the Psalms, but occurring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-8.htm">Psalm 84:8</a>; and below in ver. 18. <span class="cmt_word">How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?</span> literally, <span class="accented">how long wilt thou smoke?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>). "Against the prayer" means "in spite of the prayer," or "notwithstanding the prayer." Ordinarily, God forgives, and ceases from his anger, as soon as the afflicted one makes earnest prayer to him. But this is not always so. A time comes when his wrath cannot be appeased - when "there is no remedy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>). Evil has been persisted in too long. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/80.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>80:1-7 He that dwelleth upon the mercy-seat, is the good Shepherd of his people. But we can neither expect the comfort of his love, nor the protection of his arm, unless we partake of his converting grace. If he is really angry at the prayers of his people, it is because, although they pray, their ends are not right, or there is some secret sin indulged in them, or he will try their patience and perseverance in prayer. When God is displeased with his people, we must expect to see them in tears, and their enemies in triumph. There is no salvation but from God's favour; there is no conversion to God but by his own grace.</body></html>
