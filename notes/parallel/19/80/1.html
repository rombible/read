"Shepherd" and "Rock" were Jacob's especial names for God, as the "Fear" was that of Isaac, and the "Mighty" that of Abraham; but in the blessing of Joseph the patriarch seems to have made more than usually solemn pronunciation of it. It is, therefore, very doubtful whether we must press the selection of Joseph here as a distinct and intended reference to the northern tribes or kingdom, in distinction to Judah or the southern kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">Dwellest.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">sittest </span>(<span class= "ital">enthroned</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm" title="The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: he sits between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.">Psalm 99:1</a>.)

But we can neither expect the comfort of his love, nor the protection of his arm, unless we partake of his converting grace. If he is really angry at the prayers of his people, it is because, although they pray, their ends are not right, or there is some secret sin indulged in them, or he will try their patience and perseverance in prayer. When God is displeased with his people, we must expect to see them in tears, and their enemies in triumph. There is no salvation but from God's favour; there is no conversion to God but by his own grace.</body></html>
