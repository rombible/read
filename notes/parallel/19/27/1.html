The Latin of the Vulgate, "Dominus illuminatio mea," is the motto of the University of Oxford, and expands in a new but true direction the thought of the ancient bard. To him, Jehovah was the guiding and cheering beacon-fire, proclaiming his victory and pointing him the happy homeward way. From this to the belief in God as the source both of moral and intellectual light, is a long but glorious stage, along which the world has been guided by such words as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>, still more by the recognition of the incarnate Son as the Light of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm" title="I am come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.">John 12:46</a>, &c).<p><span class= "bld">Strength.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">defence </span>or <span class= "ital">bulwark; </span>Heb., <span class= "ital">maoz,</span> rendered "rock," <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-26.htm" title="And build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which you shall cut down.">Judges 6:26</a> (margin, <span class= "ital">strong place</span>)<span class= "ital">; </span>used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-9.htm" title="In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.">Isaiah 17:9</a> of fortified cities; as here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-39.htm" title="But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.">Psalm 37:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-2.htm" title="For you are the God of my strength: why do you cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?">Psalm 43:2</a>; LXX., "shields;" Vulg., "protector."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is my Light</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35, 36, 46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>). The statement does not occur in any other place in the Old Testament, though the idea may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a>; and elsewhere.

In God let us strengthen ourselves. The gracious presence of God, his power, his promise, his readiness to hear prayer, the witness of his Spirit in the hearts of his people; these are the secret of his tabernacle, and in these the saints find cause for that holy security and peace of mind in which they dwell at ease. The psalmist prays for constant communion with God in holy ordinances. All God's children desire to dwell in their Father's house. Not to sojourn there as a wayfaring man, to tarry but for a night; or to dwell there for a time only, as the servant that abides not in the house for ever; but to dwell there all the days of their life, as children with a father. Do we hope that the praising of God will be the blessedness of our eternity? Surely then we ought to make it the business of our time. This he had at heart more than any thing. Whatever the Christian is as to this life, he considers the favour and service of God as the one thing needful. This he desires, prays for and seeks after, and in it he rejoices.</body></html>
