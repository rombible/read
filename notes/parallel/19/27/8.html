The order of the words in the original is as follows: "To thee said my heart - Seek ye my face - thy face, Lord, will I seek." And the full meaning seems to he, "To thee said my heart - Hast thou said unto men, Seek ye my face? I for one will obey thee - Thy face, Lord, will I seek." The command, "Seek ye my face," had been given by David to the people on the day that he set up the ark upon Mount Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-11.htm">1 Chronicles 16:11</a>). It was probably regarded as implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:7-14 Wherever the believer is, he can find a way to the throne of grace by prayer. God calls us by his Spirit, by his word, by his worship, and by special providences, merciful and afflicting. When we are foolishly making court to lying vanities, God is, in love to us, calling us to seek our own mercies in him. The call is general, Seek ye my face; but we must apply it to ourselves, I will seek it. The word does us no good, when we do not ourselves accept the exhortation: a gracious heart readily answers to the call of a gracious God, being made willing in the day of his power. The psalmist requests the favour of the Lord; the continuance of his presence with him; the benefit of Divine guidance, and the benefit of Divine protection. God's time to help those that trust in him, is, when all other helpers fail. He is a surer and better Friend than earthly parents are, or can be. What was the belief which supported the psalmist? That he should see the goodness of the Lord. There is nothing like the believing hope of eternal life, the foresights of that glory, and foretastes of those pleasures, to keep us from fainting under all calamities. In the mean time he should be strengthened to bear up under his burdens. Let us look unto the suffering Saviour, and pray in faith, not to be delivered into the hands of our enemies. Let us encourage each other to wait on the Lord, with patient expectation, and fervent prayer.</body></html>
