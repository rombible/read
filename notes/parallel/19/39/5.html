It seems inconsistent that one who professes to be weary of his life should then complain of life's shortness. But such inconsistency is human. Job does the same (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And mine age is as nothing before thee</span>. The short human existence can scarcely be regarded by God as existence at all; rather, it is mere nothingness<span class="cmt_word">. Verily every man living at his best state is but vanity</span>. So our Revisers. But most moderns translate, "Verily every man living was ordained for utter vanity" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-6 If an evil thought should arise in the mind, suppress it. Watchfulness in the habit, is the bridle upon the head; watchfulness in acts, is the hand upon the bridle. When not able to separate from wicked men, we should remember they will watch our words, and turn them, if they can, to our disadvantage. Sometimes it may be necessary to keep silence, even from good words; but in general we are wrong when backward to engage in edifying discourse. Impatience is a sin that has its cause within ourselves, and that is, musing; and its ill effects upon ourselves, and that is no less than burning. In our greatest health and prosperity, every man is altogether vanity, he cannot live long; he may die soon. This is an undoubted truth, but we are very unwilling to believe it. Therefore let us pray that God would enlighten our minds by his Holy Spirit, and fill our hearts with his grace, that we may be ready for death every day and hour.</body></html>
