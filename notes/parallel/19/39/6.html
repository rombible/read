But this seems modern for the psalms. Shakespeare, no doubt with this passage in his mind, has combined it with the more obvious image:--<p>"Out, out, brief candle,<p>Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player<p>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<p>And then is heard no more."<p><span class= "bld">Surely they . . . </span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Only for a breath they make a stir.</span><p><span class= "bld">He heapeth up.</span>--The substantive is left by the Hebrew to be supplied.

Watchfulness in the habit, is the bridle upon the head; watchfulness in acts, is the hand upon the bridle. When not able to separate from wicked men, we should remember they will watch our words, and turn them, if they can, to our disadvantage. Sometimes it may be necessary to keep silence, even from good words; but in general we are wrong when backward to engage in edifying discourse. Impatience is a sin that has its cause within ourselves, and that is, musing; and its ill effects upon ourselves, and that is no less than burning. In our greatest health and prosperity, every man is altogether vanity, he cannot live long; he may die soon. This is an undoubted truth, but we are very unwilling to believe it. Therefore let us pray that God would enlighten our minds by his Holy Spirit, and fill our hearts with his grace, that we may be ready for death every day and hour.</body></html>
