Indeed there is only one instance which at all supports this rendering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-3.htm" title="And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?">1Kings 22:3</a>, margin). Nor does the context require or even admit it. If the bright side of things had been so evident that he could speak of it the Psalmist would not have feared reproach for doing so, nor was there cause for his silence "as to the law," the rabbinical mode of explaining the passage. The obvious translation makes the clause parallel with that which follows: "I held my peace <span class= "ital">without profit. </span>My sorrow was increased," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>instead of lessening my grief by silence, I only increased it.<p><span class= "bld">Stirred.</span>--The LXX. and Vulg. "renewed," which is nearer the meaning than either the Authorised Version or margin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good</span>. Some explain, "I held my peace, but <span class="accented">it did me no good</span> - I was none the better for it" (Hupfeld, Hengstenberg, Canon Cook); others adopt the Prayer-book Version, I kept silence <span class="accented">even from good words"</span> (Kay, Alexander, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">And my sorrow was stirred</span>. The pain at my heart was not quieted thereby, nor even lessened; rather, it was roused up, quickened, and aggravated. This is the natural result of repressing any strong feeling. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/39.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>39:1-6 If an evil thought should arise in the mind, suppress it. Watchfulness in the habit, is the bridle upon the head; watchfulness in acts, is the hand upon the bridle. When not able to separate from wicked men, we should remember they will watch our words, and turn them, if they can, to our disadvantage. Sometimes it may be necessary to keep silence, even from good words; but in general we are wrong when backward to engage in edifying discourse. Impatience is a sin that has its cause within ourselves, and that is, musing; and its ill effects upon ourselves, and that is no less than burning. In our greatest health and prosperity, every man is altogether vanity, he cannot live long; he may die soon. This is an undoubted truth, but we are very unwilling to believe it. Therefore let us pray that God would enlighten our minds by his Holy Spirit, and fill our hearts with his grace, that we may be ready for death every day and hour.</body></html>
