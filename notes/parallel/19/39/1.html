It was natural and becoming for him to "roar" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-8.htm" title="I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.">Psalm 38:8</a>, &c.) out his indignation or his grief, to mutter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm" title="But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.">Psalm 1:2</a>, &c) aloud his prayers, to speak out on every impulse. Now he determines to endure in silence and mutely bear the worst, rather than speak what may in the eyes of the impious be construed into a murmur against Divine Providence, into impatience under the Divine decree. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/38-13.htm" title="But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that opens not his mouth.">Psalm 38:13-14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">With a bridle.</span>--See margin, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm" title="You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the corn.">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>, where the cognate verb occurs.

Watchfulness in the habit, is the bridle upon the head; watchfulness in acts, is the hand upon the bridle. When not able to separate from wicked men, we should remember they will watch our words, and turn them, if they can, to our disadvantage. Sometimes it may be necessary to keep silence, even from good words; but in general we are wrong when backward to engage in edifying discourse. Impatience is a sin that has its cause within ourselves, and that is, musing; and its ill effects upon ourselves, and that is no less than burning. In our greatest health and prosperity, every man is altogether vanity, he cannot live long; he may die soon. This is an undoubted truth, but we are very unwilling to believe it. Therefore let us pray that God would enlighten our minds by his Holy Spirit, and fill our hearts with his grace, that we may be ready for death every day and hour.</body></html>
