The people are called upon to praise God for a recent deliverance from a long period of severe affliction and oppression at the hand of enemies (vers. 8-12), and to join in the sacrifices which are about to be offered to God in payment of the vows made during the time of trouble (vers. 13-15). As the writer ascribes to himself both the making of the vows and the offering of the sacrifices, he must have been the leader of the nation at the time of the oppression and of the deliverance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O bless our God, ye people;</span> literally, <span class="accented">ye peoples</span> - but the plural form here can scarcely point to the "nations," who have just been called, not '<span class="accented">ammim</span>, but <span class="accented">goim</span> (see ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">And make the voice of his praise to be heard</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>; cf. 5). The heartiness of the soul's devotion was made apparent by the loudness of the voice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/66.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>66:8-12 The Lord not only preserves our temporal life, but maintains the spiritual life which he has given to believers. By afflictions we are proved, as silver in the fire. The troubles of the church will certainly end well. Through various conflicts and troubles, the slave of Satan escapes from his yoke, and obtains joy and peace in believing: through much tribulation the believer must enter into the kingdom of God.</body></html>
