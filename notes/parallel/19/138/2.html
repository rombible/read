It is true this would have been expressed more in accordance with our expectation by "Thou hast magnified Thy Name above Thy promise;" but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-10.htm" title="According to your name, O God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth: your right hand is full of righteousness.">Psalm 48:10</a> for a similar thought, and for the language comp. Tennyson's:<p>"I am "become a name."<p>The LXX. and Vulg. felt the difficulty too great, and render "Thy holy one," instead of "Thy word."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/138.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will worship toward thy holy temple</span>. The term "temple" here must designate the tabernacle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And praise thy Name for thy loving-kindness and for thy truth.</span> "Mercy" and "truth" are God's two highest attributes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). They were especially shown to Israel in God's promises and his fidelity to them. <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</span> Some would amend the text, and read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5da;</span>, "thy truth," for, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5da;</span> "thy Word." But if we keep the text, and understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5da;</span> as "thy promises," the sense will not be very different. God has magnified his promise, and his faithfulness to it, above all his other revealed attributes. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/138.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>138:1-5 When we can praise God with our whole heart, we need not be unwilling for the whole world to witness our gratitude and joy in him. Those who rely on his loving-kindness and truth through Jesus Christ, will ever find him faithful to his word. If he spared not his own Son, how shall he not with him freely give us all things? If God gives us strength in our souls, to bear the burdens, resist the temptations, and to do the duties of an afflicted state, if he strengthens us to keep hold of himself by faith, and to wait with patience for the event, we are bound to be thankful.</body></html>
