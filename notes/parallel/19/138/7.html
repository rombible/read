David "walked in the midst of trouble" during the greater part of his life. When the persecution of Saul was over, he had trouble from foreign enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5-12</a>.); when these were subdued, his domestic troubles began (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5</a>:53). God, however, from time to time "gave him a reviving." <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-3.htm">Psalm 9:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14-17</a>, etc.). What God had so often done for him, David is confident that he will do again. He will break the power of his enemies, and deliver him from their machinations. <span class="cmt_word">And thy right hand</span>. The symbol of strength. <span class="cmt_word">Shall save me;</span> or, "deliver me" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-8.htm">Psalm 63:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-6.htm">Psalm 108:6</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/138.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>138:6-8 Though the Lord is high, yet he has respect to every lowly, humbled sinner; but the proud and unbelieving will be banished far from his blissful presence. Divine consolations have enough in them to revive us, even when we walk in the midst of troubles. And God will save his own people that they may be revived by the Holy Spirit, the Giver of life and holiness. If we give to God the glory of his mercy, we may take to ourselves the comfort. This confidence will not do away, but quicken prayer. Whatever good there is in us, it is God works in us both to will and to do. The Lord will perfect the salvation of every true believer, and he will never forsake those whom he has created anew in Christ Jesus unto good works.</body></html>
