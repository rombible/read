David, too, had sent back Zadok with the Ark, which in the popular view meant sending away the power and the presence of God. Even Zadok seemed to share this feeling; and David's words to him, "thou a seer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-27.htm" title="The king said also to Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.">2Samuel 15:27</a>), seem to contain something of a rebuke.<p><span class= "bld">Selah.</span>--This curious word must apparently remain for ever what it has been ever since the first translation of the Bible was made--the puzzle of ordinary readers, and the despair of scholars. One certain fact about it has been reached, and this the very obscurity of the term confirms. It has no ethical significance, as the Targum, followed by some other of the old versions and by St. Jerome, implies, for in that case it would long ago have yielded a satisfactory meaning. There are many obscure words in Hebrew, but their obscurity arises from the infrequency of their use; but <span class= "ital">selah </span>occurs no less than seventy-one times in the compass of thirty-nine psalms, and three times in the ode of Habakkuk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm" title="God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.">Habakkuk 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm" title="Your bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even your word. Selah. You did split the earth with rivers.">Habakkuk 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm" title="You went forth for the salvation of your people, even for salvation with your anointed; you wounded the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation to the neck. Selah.">Habakkuk 3:13</a>). It is pretty certain that the sense "for ever," which is the traditional interpretation of the Rabbinical schools, does not suit the majority of these places, and no other moral or spiritual rendering has ever been suggested; nor is it a poetical word, marking the end of a verse or the division into strophes, for it occurs sometimes in the very middle of a stanza, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/20-3.htm" title="Remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice; Selah.">Psalm 20:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/32-4.htm" title="For day and night your hand was heavy on me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.">Psalm 32:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/52-3.htm" title="You love evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.">Psalm 52:3-4</a>, and often at the end of a psalm (Psalms 46). There is only one conclusion, now universally admitted, that <span class= "ital">selah </span>is a musical term, but in the hopeless perplexity and darkness that besets the whole subject of Hebrew music, its precise intention must be left unexplained. The conjecture that has the most probability on its side makes it a direction to <span class= "ital">play loud. </span>The derivation from <span class= "ital">salah, "</span>to raise," is in favour of this view. The fact that in one place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm" title="The LORD is known by the judgment which he executes: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.">Psalm 9:16</a>) it is joined to <span class= "ital">higgaion, </span>which is explained as a term having reference to the sound of stringed instruments, lends support to it, as also does the translation uniformly adopted in the Psalms by the LXX.: <span class= "greekheb">????????</span>--if, indeed, that word means interlude. It is curious that the interpretation next in favour to Ewald's makes the meaning of <span class= "ital">selah </span>exactly the opposite to his--<span class= "ital">piano </span>instead of <span class= "ital">forte</span>--deriving it from a word meaning "to be silent," "to suspend."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God.</span> When Absalom first raised the standard of revolt, there were no doubt many who looked to see some signal Divine interposition on behalf of the anointed king and against the rebel; but when David fled, and with so few followers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>), and in his flight spoke so doubtfully of his prospects (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-26.htm">2 Samuel 15:26</a>), and when no help seemed to arise from any quarter, then we can well understand that men's opinions changed, and they came to think that David was God-forsaken, and would succumb to his unnatural foe (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10, 11</a>). Partisans of Absalom would see in David's expulsion from his capital a Divine Nemesis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-8.htm">2 Samuel 16:8</a>), and regard it as quite natural that God should not help him. <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>. There is no traditional explanation of this word. The LXX. rendered it by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> which is said to mean "a change of the musical tone;" but it is against this explanation that <span class="accented">selah</span> occurs sometimes, as here, at the end of a psalm, where no change was possible. Other explanations rest wholly on conjecture, and are valueless. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-3 An active believer, the more he is beaten off from God, either by the rebukes of providence, or the reproaches of enemies, the faster hold he will take, and the closer will he cleave to him. A child of God startles at the very thought of despairing of help in God. See what God is to his people, what he will be, what they have found him, what David found in him. 1. Safety; a shield for me; which denotes the advantage of that protection. 2. Honour; those whom God owns for his, have true honour put upon them. 3. Joy and deliverance. If, in the worst of times, God's people can lift up their heads with joy, knowing that all shall work for good to them, they will own God as giving them both cause and hearts to rejoice.</body></html>
