All strength dies out under the action of the many acute pains which rack the whole frame, and as little remains as there remains of moisture in a potsherd. <span class="cmt_word">And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws</span>. An extreme and agonizing thirst sets in - the secretions generally fail - and the saliva especially is suppressed, so that the mouth feels parched and dry. Hence the cry of suffering which was at last wrung from our Lord, when, just before the end, he exclaimed, "I thirst" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast brought me into the dust of death</span>. "The dust of death" is a periphrasis for death itself, which is so closely associated in our thoughts with the dust of the tomb (see below, ver. 29; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-35.htm">Job 34:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:11-21 In these verses we have Christ suffering, and Christ praying; by which we are directed to look for crosses, and to look up to God under them. The very manner of Christ's death is described, though not in use among the Jews. They pierced his hands and his feet, which were nailed to the accursed tree, and his whole body was left so to hang as to suffer the most severe pain and torture. His natural force failed, being wasted by the fire of Divine wrath preying upon his spirits. Who then can stand before God's anger? or who knows the power of it? The life of the sinner was forfeited, and the life of the Sacrifice must be the ransom for it. Our Lord Jesus was stripped, when he was crucified, that he might clothe us with the robe of his righteousness. Thus it was written, therefore thus it behoved Christ to suffer. Let all this confirm our faith in him as the true Messiah, and excite our love to him as the best of friends, who loved us, and suffered all this for us. Christ in his agony prayed, prayed earnestly, prayed that the cup might pass from him. When we cannot rejoice in God as our song, yet let us stay ourselves upon him as our strength; and take the comfort of spiritual supports, when we cannot have spiritual delights. He prays to be delivered from the Divine wrath. He that has delivered, doth deliver, and will do so. We should think upon the sufferings and resurrection of Christ, till we feel in our souls the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings.</body></html>
