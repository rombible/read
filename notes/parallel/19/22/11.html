The considerations dwelt upon in vers. 3-5, and again in veto. 9, 10, have removed the sense of desertion expressed in vex. 1; and the Sufferer can now confidently call on God to help him. "Be not far from me," he says, <span class="cmt_word">for trouble is near</span>. The time is come when aid is most urgently required. <span class="cmt_word">For there is none to</span> <span class="cmt_word">help;</span> literally, <span class="accented">not a helper.</span> David himself had never been in such straits. He had always had friends and followers. Under Saul's persecution he had a friend in Jonathan; he was supported by his father and his brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>); in a short time he found himself at the head of four hundred (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>), and then of six hundred men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>). In Absalom's rebellion there remained faithful to him the priestly tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>) and the Gibborim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>), and others to the number of some thousands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-4.htm">2 Samuel 18:4</a>). But he whom David prefigured, his Antitype, was desexed, was alone - "All the disciples forsook him and fled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>) - he was truly one that "had no helper." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:11-21 In these verses we have Christ suffering, and Christ praying; by which we are directed to look for crosses, and to look up to God under them. The very manner of Christ's death is described, though not in use among the Jews. They pierced his hands and his feet, which were nailed to the accursed tree, and his whole body was left so to hang as to suffer the most severe pain and torture. His natural force failed, being wasted by the fire of Divine wrath preying upon his spirits. Who then can stand before God's anger? or who knows the power of it? The life of the sinner was forfeited, and the life of the Sacrifice must be the ransom for it. Our Lord Jesus was stripped, when he was crucified, that he might clothe us with the robe of his righteousness. Thus it was written, therefore thus it behoved Christ to suffer. Let all this confirm our faith in him as the true Messiah, and excite our love to him as the best of friends, who loved us, and suffered all this for us. Christ in his agony prayed, prayed earnestly, prayed that the cup might pass from him. When we cannot rejoice in God as our song, yet let us stay ourselves upon him as our strength; and take the comfort of spiritual supports, when we cannot have spiritual delights. He prays to be delivered from the Divine wrath. He that has delivered, doth deliver, and will do so. We should think upon the sufferings and resurrection of Christ, till we feel in our souls the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings.</body></html>
