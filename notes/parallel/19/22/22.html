The thought of the brethren is uppermost. As, when the body was removed, loving messages were at once sent to the disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), so, with the soul of the Redeemer in the intermediate state, the "brethren" are the first care. God's Name, and all that he has done - the acceptance of the sacrifice, the effectuation of man's salvation - shall be made known to them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9-12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee</span>. He will join with them in praising and adoring his Father, so soon as circumstances allow (compare the Eucharist at Emmaus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:22-31 The Saviour now speaks as risen from the dead. The first words of the complaint were used by Christ himself upon the cross; the first words of the triumph are expressly applied to him, Heb 2:12. All our praises must refer to the work of redemption. The suffering of the Redeemer was graciously accepted as a full satisfaction for sin. Though it was offered for sinful men, the Father did not despise or abhor it for our sakes. This ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. All humble, gracious souls should have a full satisfaction and happiness in him. Those that hunger and thirst after righteousness in Christ, shall not labour for that which satisfies not. Those that are much in praying, will be much in thanksgiving. Those that turn to God, will make conscience of worshipping before him. Let every tongue confess that he is Lord. High and low, rich and poor, bond and free, meet in Christ. Seeing we cannot keep alive our own souls, it is our wisdom, by obedient faith, to commit our souls to Christ, who is able to save and keep them alive for ever. A seed shall serve him. God will have a church in the world to the end of time. They shall be accounted to him for a generation; he will be the same to them that he was to those who went before them. His righteousness, and not any of their own, they shall declare to be the foundation of all their hopes, and the fountain of all their joys. Redemption by Christ is the Lord's own doing. Here we see the free love and compassion of God the Father, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, for us wretched sinners, as the source of all grace and consolation; the example we are to follow, the treatment as Christians we are to expect, and the conduct under it we are to adopt. Every lesson may here be learned that can profit the humbled soul. Let those who go about to establish their own righteousness inquire, why the beloved Son of God should thus suffer, if their own doings could atone for sin? Let the ungodly professor consider whether the Saviour thus honoured the Divine law, to purchase him the privilege of despising it. Let the careless take warning to flee from the wrath to come, and the trembling rest their hopes upon this merciful Redeemer. Let the tempted and distressed believer cheerfully expect a happy end of every trial.</body></html>
