David will not allow himself to be "forgotten;" he will recall himself to God's remembrance. "Consider - hear me," he says, "O Lord my God;" still "my God," although thou hast forgotten me, and therefore bound to "hear me." Lighten mine eyes. Not so much "enlighten me spiritually," as "cheer me up; put brightness into my eyes; revive me" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>, "Grace hath been showed from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape... that our God may <span class="accented">lighten out eyes</span>, and give us a little reviving"). Lest I sleep the sleep of death; literally, <span class="accented">lest I sleep death.</span> Death is compared to a sleep by Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>), Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-39.htm">Jeremiah 51:39, 57</a>), Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>), and here by David, in the Old Testament; and by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-13</a>) and St. Paul in the New (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14, 15</a>). The external resemblance of a corpse to a sleeping person was the root of the metaphor, and we shall do wrong to conclude from its employment anything with respect to the psalmist's views concerning the real nature of death. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 The psalmist complains that God had long withdrawn. He earnestly prays for comfort. He assures himself of an answer of peace. - God sometimes hides his face, and leaves his own children in the dark concerning their interest in him: and this they lay to heart more than any outward trouble whatever. But anxious cares are heavy burdens with which believers often load themselves more than they need. The bread of sorrows is sometimes the saint's daily bread; our Master himself was a man of sorrows. It is a common temptation, when trouble lasts long, to think that it will last always. Those who have long been without joy, begin to be without hope. We should never allow ourselves to make any complaints but what drive us to our knees. Nothing is more killing to a soul than the want of God's favour; nothing more reviving than the return of it. The sudden, delightful changes in the book of Psalms, are often very remarkable. We pass from depth of despondency to the height of religious confidence and joy. It is thus, ver. 5. All is gloomy dejection in ver. 4; but here the mind of the despondent worshipper rises above all its distressing fears, and throws itself, without reserve, on the mercy and care of its Divine Redeemer. See the power of faith, and how good it is to draw near to God. If we bring our cares and griefs to the throne of grace, and leave them there, we may go away like Hannah, and our countenances will be no more said, 1Sa 1:18. God's mercy is the support of the psalmist's faith. Finding I have that to trust to, I am comforted, though I have no merit of my own. His faith in God's mercy filled his heart with joy in his salvation; for joy and peace come by believing. He has dealt bountifully with me. By faith he was as confident of salvation, as if it had been completed already. In this way believers pour out their prayers, renouncing all hopes but in the mercy of God through the Saviour's blood: and sometimes suddenly, at others gradually, they will find their burdens removed, and their comforts restored; they then allow that their fears and complaints were unnecessary, and acknowledge that the Lord hath dealt bountifully with them.</body></html>
