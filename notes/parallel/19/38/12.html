To the desertion of friends is added the persecution of enemies, who take advantage of the debility and prostration caused by sickness to plot against the writer's life, to "lay snares for him," and devise evil against him. Those who assign the psalm to David suppose the devices described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a> to he referred to. <span class="cmt_word">And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long</span>; literally, <span class="accented">speak malignity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> calumniate me - bring false accusations against me (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-7.htm">2 Samuel 16:7, 8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:12-22 Wicked men hate goodness, even when they benefit by it. David, in the complaints he makes of his enemies, seems to refer to Christ. But our enemies do us real mischief only when they drive us from God and our duty. The true believer's trouble will be made useful; he will learn to wait for his God, and will not seek relief from the world or himself. The less we notice the unkindness and injuries that are done us, the more we consult the quiet of our own minds. David's troubles were the chastisement and the consequence of his transgressions, whilst Christ suffered for our sins and ours only. What right can a sinner have to yield to impatience or anger, when mercifully corrected for his sins? David was very sensible of the present workings of corruption in him. Good men, by setting their sorrow continually before them, have been ready to fall; but by setting God always before them, they have kept their standing. If we are truly penitent for sin, that will make us patient under affliction. Nothing goes nearer to the heart of a believer when in affliction, than to be under the apprehension of God's deserting him; nor does any thing come more feelingly from his heart than this prayer, Be not far from me. The Lord will hasten to help those who trust in him as their salvation.</body></html>
