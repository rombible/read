Canon Cook suggests that they introduce four reasons for the psalmist's silence (vers. 13, 14) and abstinence front self-justification: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because God hears him, and will make answer for him (ver. 15); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because, if he spoke, he might give further occasion to his enemies (ver. 16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because he feels in danger, and is conscious of sin (ver. 17); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> because he has no course open to him but confession and contrition. If we are justified in attributing the psalm to David, and in assigning its composition to the period immediately preceding Absalom's rebellion, we must look upon it as opening to us a view of David's condition of mind at that time which is of great interest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:12-22 Wicked men hate goodness, even when they benefit by it. David, in the complaints he makes of his enemies, seems to refer to Christ. But our enemies do us real mischief only when they drive us from God and our duty. The true believer's trouble will be made useful; he will learn to wait for his God, and will not seek relief from the world or himself. The less we notice the unkindness and injuries that are done us, the more we consult the quiet of our own minds. David's troubles were the chastisement and the consequence of his transgressions, whilst Christ suffered for our sins and ours only. What right can a sinner have to yield to impatience or anger, when mercifully corrected for his sins? David was very sensible of the present workings of corruption in him. Good men, by setting their sorrow continually before them, have been ready to fall; but by setting God always before them, they have kept their standing. If we are truly penitent for sin, that will make us patient under affliction. Nothing goes nearer to the heart of a believer when in affliction, than to be under the apprehension of God's deserting him; nor does any thing come more feelingly from his heart than this prayer, Be not far from me. The Lord will hasten to help those who trust in him as their salvation.</body></html>
