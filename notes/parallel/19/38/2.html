(On the "arrows" of the Almighty, see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-17.htm">Psalm 77:17</a>, etc.) It has been maintained that by "God's arrows" only sickness is meant (Hitzig); but the contrary appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23-25</a>. Hengstenberg is right, "The arrows of the Almighty denote all the chastisements of sin depending on God." And thy hand presseth me sore. The verb used is the same in both clauses; but it is difficult to express both ideas by one term in English. Dr. Kay makes the attempt by translating, "For thine arrows have sunk deep in me; yea, thine hand sank heavily on me." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/38.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>38:1-11 Nothing will disquiet the heart of a good man so much as the sense of God's anger. The way to keep the heart quiet, is to keep ourselves in the love of God. But a sense of guilt is too heavy to bear; and would sink men into despair and ruin, unless removed by the pardoning mercy of God. If there were not sin in our souls, there would be no pain in our bones, no illness in our bodies. The guilt of sin is a burden to the whole creation, which groans under it. It will be a burden to the sinners themselves, when they are heavy-laden under it, or a burden of ruin, when it sinks them to hell. When we perceive our true condition, the Good Physician will be valued, sought, and obeyed. Yet many let their wounds rankle, because they delay to go to their merciful Friend. When, at any time, we are distempered in our bodies, we ought to remember how God has been dishonoured in and by our bodies. The groanings which cannot be uttered, are not hid from Him that searches the heart, and knows the mind of the Spirit. David, in his troubles, was a type of Christ in his agonies, of Christ on his cross, suffering and deserted.</body></html>
