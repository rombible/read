For the word "remembrance," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm" title="Sing to the LORD, O you saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.">Psalm 30:4</a>. It is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm" title="And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.">Exodus 3:15</a>, "This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial through all generations." The generations come and go, and the memory of man perishes, but the name "Jehovah" endures still, the object of adoration and praise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/102.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The second part of the psalm here begins. Against the complaint is to be set the confident hope and consolation. <span class="cmt_word">But thou, O Lord, shalt endure forever.</span> God does not "wither" or decay - God and God's purposes "endure forever." It matters not that Israel is brought so low, and seems at the last gasp; God can raise up his people, and will do so in his own good time (vers. 13-17). <span class="cmt_word">And thy remembrance unto all generations;</span> or, <span class="accented">thy memorial</span> (Revised Version); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>. God's "remembrance," or "memorial," consists in the recollection, that his faithful ones have, of his historically manifested attributes. If this recollection is never to pass away, his faithful ones must remain also, to keep it up. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/102.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>102:12-22 We are dying creatures, but God is an everlasting God, the protector of his church; we may be confident that it will not be neglected. When we consider our own vileness, our darkness and deadness, and the manifold defects in our prayers, we have cause to fear that they will not be received in heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for we have an Advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under the law. Redemption is the subject of praise in the Christian church; and that great work is described by the temporal deliverance and restoration of Israel. Look down upon us, Lord Jesus; and bring us into the glorious liberty of thy children, that we may bless and praise thy name.</body></html>
