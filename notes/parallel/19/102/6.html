"It has been objected that the pelican is a water-bird, and cannot, therefore, be the <span class= "ital">kaath </span>of the Scriptures--"the pelican of the wilderness"--as it must of necessity starve in the desert; but a <span class= "ital">midbar </span>(wilderness) is often used to denote a wide open space, cultivated or uncultivated, and is not to be restricted to barren spots destitute of water; moreover, as a matter of fact, the pelican after filling its capacious pouch with fish, molluscs, &c, often does. retire to places far inland, where it consumes what it has captured. Thus, too, it breeds on the great sandy wastes near the mouths of the Danube. The expression 'pelican in the wilderness,' in the psalmist's pitiable complaint, is a true picture of the bird as it sits in apparently melancholy mood with its bill resting on its breast (<span class= "ital">Bible Educator, </span>iv. 8).<p><span class= "bld">Owl.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">khos. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-17.htm" title="And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,">Leviticus 11:17</a>.) The bird is identified with the "owl" by the Hebrew in this passage, which should be rendered, "owl of the <span class= "ital">ruins." </span>Some, however, would identify this bird with the pelican, since <span class= "ital">khos </span>means "cup," rendering "the pelican, even the pouch-bird." (See <span class= "ital">Bible Educator, </span>ii. 346.) LXX., Aquila, Theodotion, all have "screech-owl;" Symmachus, the "hoopoe."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/102.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am like a pelican in the wilderness.</span> The Hebrew word here rendered "pelican" is elsewhere in our version translated by "cormorant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-17.htm">Deuteronomy 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>); but it is now generally believed that the pelican is intended (compare the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, and see Mr. Houghton's letter in the <span class="accented">Academy</span>, April 5, 1884, and the versions of Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, and our Revisers). The pelican is a bird which haunts marshy and desolate places. It abounds in the Lake Huleh in Northern Galilee (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 260). <span class="cmt_word">I am like an owl of the desert;</span> or, "of the ruins." The owl haunts ruins in the East no less than in our own country (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 484, note). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/102.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>102:1-11 The whole word of God is of use to direct us in prayer; but here, is often elsewhere, the Holy Ghost has put words into our mouths. Here is a prayer put into the hands of the afflicted; let them present it to God. Even good men may be almost overwhelmed with afflictions. It is our duty and interest to pray; and it is comfort to an afflicted spirit to unburden itself, by a humble representation of its griefs. We must say, Blessed be the name of the Lord, who both gives and takes away. The psalmist looked upon himself as a dying man; My days are like a shadow.</body></html>
