"Why multiply instances? It is written, the heavens and the earth shall fade away like a vesture, which, indeed they are--the time vesture of the Eternal."--<span class= "ital">Sartor Resartus, </span>I. 11<p>It is interesting to think how the science of geology confirms the image of the psalmist, showing how time has been literally changing the so solid-seeming earth, stripping off the robe that covers the hills, to fold it down at some river mouth, or at the bottom of the ocean bed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/102.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall perish.</span> The coming destruction of the world that now is, is very frequently declared in Holy Scripture (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-31.htm">Mark 13:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-33.htm">Luke 21:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7, 10, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But thou shalt endure.</span> With the perishable nature of the whole material creation, the psalmist contrasts the absolute eternity of God (comp. ver. 12; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.</span> Compare the prophecies of "a new heaven and a new earth" (Isaiah 55:17; 66:22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/102.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>102:23-28 Bodily distempers soon weaken our strength, then what can we expect but that our months should be cut off in the midst; and what should we do but provide accordingly? We must own God's hand in it; and must reconcile this to his love, for often those that have used their strength well, have it weakened; and those who, as we think, can very ill be spared, have their days shortened. It is very comfortable, in reference to all the changes and dangers of the church, to remember that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. And in reference to the death of our bodies, and the removal of friends, to remember that God is an everlasting God. Do not let us overlook the assurance this psalm contains of a happy end to all the believer's trials. Though all things are changing, dying, perishing, like a vesture folding up and hastening to decay, yet Jesus lives, and thus all is secure, for he hath said, Because I live ye shall live also.</body></html>
