Buildings, and these places of worship, must be meant, and it is implied that they are scattered over the land, and can therefore mean nothing but synagogues. The "high places" would' not be called God's, nor would Bethel and Dan have been so called, being connected with irregular and unorthodox worship. Thus we have a clear note of time, indicating a period not only later than the rise of the synagogue in Ezra's time, but <span class= "ital">much </span>later, since it takes time for a new institution to spread over a country. Aquila and Symmachus actually render "synagogues." Possibly the LXX. are right in putting the latter clause into the mouth of the enemies, "let us burn," &c<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/74.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them altogether</span>. It was, no doubt, the intention of Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Israel as a nation. Hence the complete destruction of the city and temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-19.htm">2 Chronicles 36:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1-9</a>, etc.); hence the deportation of all the <span class="accented">strength</span> of the nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>), and their settlement in the far off region of Babylonia; hence the desolation, not only of Jerusalem, but of "all the habitations of Jacob" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2</a>), all the "strongholds of the daughter of Judah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have burnt up all the synagogues of God in the land.</span> The synagogue system was first introduced by Ezra, according to Jewish tradition; and it has been argued that the mention of "synagogues" here - literally, "sacred meeting places" - proves the psalm to be Maccabean. But meeting places for worship, other than the temple, always existed in Palestine, both before and after its erection. Mesha speaks of having plundered a "house of Jehovah" in his war with Ahab ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11:p. 167); and it is plain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a> that religious meetings were held by the prophets, probably in houses devoted to the purpose, during the period of the divided monarchy. Hezekiah's destruction of the high places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>) is not likely to have interfered with the use of these buildings, to which no savour of idolatry can have attached in the mind of the most violent iconoclast. I should therefore believe, with Leopold Low, that buildings existed before the Exile, in which religious instruction was given by authorized teachers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>74:1-11 This psalm appears to describe the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by the Chaldeans. The deplorable case of the people of God, at the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest prayer.</body></html>
