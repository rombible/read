they set up their ensigns for signs.">Psalm 74:4</a> (see Note) says of the heathen signs. While these abominations--rallying points of savage profanity--were visibly set up, the tokens of the invisible God's presence, His wonders wrought for Israel, are no more seen.<p><span class= "bld">There is no more any prophet.</span>--This was the constant lament of the Maccabaean period (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-46.htm" title="And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a convenient place, until there should come a prophet to shew what should be done with them.">1 Maccabees 4:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/9-27.htm" title="So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereof was not since the time that a prophet was not seen among them.">1 Maccabees 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/14-41.htm" title="Also that the Jews and priests were well pleased that Simon should be their governor and high priest for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet;">1 Maccabees 14:41</a>), and suits no earlier time--at least none into which the rest of the psalm would fit. During the exile period Jeremiah and Ezekiel were prophesying, and the complaint took quite a different form then and probably for some time afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-9.htm" title="Her gates are sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.">Lamentations 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm" title="Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.">Ezekiel 7:26</a>). The full desolation of the situation is told in "Song of the Three Children," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm" title="You did split the fountain and the flood: you dried up mighty rivers.">Psalm 74:15</a>; "Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before Thee or find mercy."<p><span class= "bld">Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</span>--This, too, carries us on past the time of Jeremiah, who had given an exact date for the termination of the exile. Probably (if the arrangement of the words is right) we have here another expression of a widely-spread feeling--a feeling which inspired the apocalyptic literature, which had for its object partly to answer this question, how long? But it has been suggested, as more in the Hebrew style, to end the clause with the word <span class= "ital">know, </span>and make it directly parallel with the preceding ("there is neither a prophet nor one who knows"), and carry on the interrogative to the next verse, where its repetition would add much to the force of the question there put. (Burgess.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/74.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We see not our signs.</span> Some suppose "standards" to be meant, as in ver. 4, where the same word is used; but it is, perhaps, better to understand, with Dr. Kay, "Divine ordinances, which were standing signs of God's presence - as the tabernacle, the sacrifices, the sabbaths." There is <span class="cmt_word">no more any prophet</span>. It has been said that this shows the psalm not to have been written on the occasion of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, since Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were, all of them, then living. But the writer only means to say that there are no prophets in Palestine, where he is residing. Jeremiah in Egypt, Ezekiel on the banks of Chebar, Daniel in Babylon, are nothing to him, even if he knows of their existence, and in no way fill up the gap whereof he complains. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there among us any who knoweth how long.</span> Jeremiah's prophecy of the seventy years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12</a>) did net remove the doubt, since it was uncertain from what event the seventy years were to be counted. Jeremiah's prophecies, moreover, were not yet, in all probability, collected into a volume, and so may not have been known to the psalmist. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>74:1-11 This psalm appears to describe the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by the Chaldeans. The deplorable case of the people of God, at the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest prayer.</body></html>
