The psalmist describes Jerusalem as fallen into "perpetual ruins" (ver. 3). The temple is violated (ver. 3); its carved work is ruthlessly cut down (ver. 6); the aid of fire has been called in to destroy it, and its walls are cast down to the ground (ver. 7). Nor has Jerusalem alone suffered. The object has been to "make havoc" of Israel "altogether;" and the enemy have spread themselves, and "burnt up all the houses of God in the land" (ver. 8). The prophets have succumbed; their voices are heard no more (ver. 9). A blasphemous enemy lords it over the entire country (vers. 10, 23), and sets up its banners as signs of its dominion (ver. 4). Three periods have been assigned for the composition of the psalm: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the time of the invasion of Shishak; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that of the Babylonian conquest; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the early Maceabean period, or the reign of Judas Maccabaens. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In favour of the first is the ascription of the psalm in the "title" to Asaph. But all other considerations are against it. There is no evidence that Shishak ever entered Jerusalem. He certainly did not break down the carved work of the temple, or set the temple on fire, much less "cast it down to the ground." His invasion was a mere raid, and Rehoboam seems to have bought his retreat by the sacrifice of the temple treasury (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-12</a>). The circumstances described in the psalm are also unsuitable to the reign of Judas Maccabaeus, in whose time the temple suffered desecration at the hands of the Syrians, but was not seriously damaged, much less demolished. Thus the only date suitable for the composition of the psalm is that immediately following the capture of the city under Nebuchadnezzar. We must explain the "title" by the consideration that Asaph, like Jeduthun and Heman, became a tribe name, attaching to all the descendants of the original Asaph, and was equivalent to "sou of Asaph" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-41.htm">Ezra 2:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-44.htm">Nehemiah 7:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-22.htm">Nehemiah 11:22</a>). The psalm consists of three portions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A complaint to God, including a description of all the horrors of the situation (vers. 1-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> An enumeration of God's mercies in the olden time, as a foundation for hope that he will yet rescue Israel (vers. 12-17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> An earnest prayer for relief and restoration, and the re-establishment of the covenant (vers. 18-23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O God, why hast thou cast us off forever?</span> It could only have been in the extremity of distress that a devout Israelite believed, even for a time, that Israel was "<span class="accented">cast off forever"</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>, which must have been written nearly at the same period as this). <span class="cmt_word">Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</span> God's anger "smokes" when it is hot and furious (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>). It is now smoking "against the sheep of his pasture" - his own flock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-53.htm">Psalm 78:53</a>), his peculiar people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6, 17</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-13.htm">Psalm 79:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>74:1-11 This psalm appears to describe the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by the Chaldeans. The deplorable case of the people of God, at the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest prayer.</body></html>
