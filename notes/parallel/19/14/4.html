Some, however, prefer to divide the two clauses, "Ah, they shall see--all the workers of iniquity who eat my people--they eat bread (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>live) regardless of Jehovah."

Can it be possible that none of these evil-doers is aware of the results of evil-doing? Do they think to escape Divine retribution? The "wonder expresses the magnitude of their folly" (Hengstenberg). <span class="cmt_word">Who eat up my people as they eat bread</span>. Reducing men to poverty, robbing them, and devouring their substance, is called, in Scripture, devouring the men themselves (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>). Those who are plundered and despoiled are compared to "bread" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>.

This might have seemed scarcely to need mention, since "how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14</a>). But it connects them definitely with the atheists of ver. 1. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-7 A description of the depravity of human nature, and the deplorable corruption of a great part of mankind. - The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. The sinner here described is an atheist, one that saith there is no Judge or Governor of the world, no Providence ruling over the affairs of men. He says this in his heart. He cannot satisfy himself that there is none, but wishes there were none, and pleases himself that it is possible there may be none; he is willing to think there is none. This sinner is a fool; he is simple and unwise, and this is evidence of it: he is wicked and profane, and this is the cause. The word of God is a discerner of these thoughts. No man will say, There is no God, till he is so hardened in sin, that it is become his interest that there should be none to call him to an account. The disease of sin has infected the whole race of mankind. They are all gone aside, there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Whatever good is in any of the children of men, or is done by them, it is not of themselves, it is God's work in them. They are gone aside from the right way of their duty, the way that leads to happiness, and are turned into the paths of the destroyer. Let us lament the corruption of our nature, and see what need we have of the grace of God: let us not marvel that we are told we must be born again. And we must not rest in any thing short of union with Christ, and a new creation to holiness by his Spirit. The psalmist endeavours to convince sinners of the evil and danger of their way, while they think themselves very wise, and good, and safe. Their wickedness is described. Those that care not for God's people, for God's poor, care not for God himself. People run into all manner of wickedness, because they do not call upon God for his grace. What good can be expected from those that live without prayer? But those that will not fear God, may be made to fear at the shaking of a leaf. All our knowledge of the depravity of human nature should endear to us salvation out of Zion. But in heaven alone shall the whole company of the redeemed rejoice fully, and for evermore. The world is bad; oh that the Messiah would come and change its character! There is universal corruption; oh for the times of reformation! The triumphs of Zion's King will be the joys of Zion's children. The second coming of Christ, finally to do away the dominion of sin and Satan, will be the completing of this salvation, which is the hope, and will be the joy of every Israelite indeed. With this assurance we should comfort ourselves and one another, under the sins of sinners and sufferings of saints.</body></html>
