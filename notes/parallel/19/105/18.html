The grammar of the clause does not decide its sense with certainty; for its syntax is rather in favour of the Prayer Book Version, though the feminine form of the verb makes in favour of the marginal rendering. Symmachus has, "his soul came into iron;" the LXX., "his soul passed through iron." The Vulg., however, has the other Version, "the iron passed through his soul"--first found in the Targum. The parallelism is in favour of the Authorised Version.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/105.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his soul entered into iron.</span> In Genesis nothing more is said than that Joseph "was bound" in the prison (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-3.htm">Genesis 40:3</a>). But the psalmist knows what imprisonment was in those early times. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/105.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>105:8-23 Let us remember the Redeemer's marvellous works, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth. Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.</body></html>
