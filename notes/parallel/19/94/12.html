The beatitude of suffering could not be made altogether plain in the Old Testament, though in Job the spirit of it is nearly reached. Here the poet sees thus far, that he who is the victim of misfortunes may be congratulated if he may stand aside and calmly watch the course of Divine Providence involving evil men in punishment. What he has himself endured has chastened him, and <span class= "ital">caused him to be quiet from the evil days</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>has calmed him in viewing evil circumstances.

The blessedness of chastening appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-32.htm">Psalm 89:32, 33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a>; and is the main point of Elihu's teaching in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15-30</a>. It is not, as some have argued, entirely a New Testament doctrine. Unassisted human reason might discover it. Greek poets noted the connection between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. Our own great dramatist draws upon his experience when he says- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Sweet are the uses of adversity;<br />Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,<br />Bears yet a precious jewel in his head."</span> <span class="cmt_word">And teachest him out of thy Law.</span> The existence of "the Law," and the general knowledge of it by God's people, is assumed here, as elsewhere in the Psalms (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>.). Also it is assumed that "the Law" is a revelation from God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>94:12-23 That man is blessed, who, under the chastening of the Lord, is taught his will and his truths, from his holy word, and by the Holy Spirit. He should see mercy through his sufferings. There is a rest remaining for the people of God after the days of their adversity, which shall not last always. He that sends the trouble, will send the rest. The psalmist found succour and relief only in the Lord, when all earthly friends failed. We are beholden, not only to God's power, but to his pity, for spiritual supports; and if we have been kept from falling into sin, or shrinking from our duty, we should give him the glory, and encourage our brethren. The psalmist had many troubled thoughts concerning the case he was in, concerning the course he should take, and what was likely to be the end of it. The indulgence of such contrivances and fears, adds to care and distrust, and renders our views more gloomy and confused. Good men sometimes have perplexed and distressed thoughts concerning God. But let them look to the great and precious promises of the gospel. The world's comforts give little delight to the soul, when hurried with melancholy thoughts; but God's comforts bring that peace and pleasure which the smiles of the world cannot give, and which the frowns of the world cannot take away. God is his people's Refuge, to whom they may flee, in whom they are safe, and may be secure. And he will reckon with the wicked. A man cannot be more miserable than his own wickedness will make him, if the Lord visit it upon him.</body></html>
