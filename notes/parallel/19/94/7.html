This carelessness of heaven to injustice and crime, which, in the mouth of the heathen (or, perhaps, of apostate Jews), appeared so monstrous to the Hebrews, was a doctrine of the philosophy of ancient times. It appears in the saying of Seneca: "<span class= "ital">Stoicus deus nec cor nec caput habet</span>." And in the Homeric hymn to Demeter men are represented as only <span class= "ital">enduring </span>the gifts of the gods because they are stronger, and give only grudgingly. (Comp. Lucretius, 1:45.) The feeling has been well caught in Tennyson's <span class= "ital">Lotus Eaters:</span><p>"Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,<p>In the hollow Lotus-land to live and lie reclined,<p>On the hills like gods together, <span class= "ital">careless of mankind."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/94.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet they say, The Lord shall not see</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11, 13</a>). Foreign enemies did not suppose that Jehovah would not see, but trusted that their own gods were stronger than he, and would protect them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</span> "The God of Jacob" would not be a natural expression in the mouth of Israel's foreign foes. They knew nothing of Jacob. But it was an expression frequently used by Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-1.htm">Psalm 81:1, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>94:1-11 We may with boldness appeal to God; for he is the almighty Judge by whom every man is judged. Let this encourage those who suffer wrong, to bear it with silence, committing themselves to Him who judges righteously. These prayers are prophecies, which speak terror to the sons of violence. There will come a day of reckoning for all the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against God, his truths, and ways, and people. It would hardly be believed, if we did not witness it, that millions of rational creatures should live, move, speak, hear, understand, and do what they purpose, yet act as if they believed that God would not punish the abuse of his gifts. As all knowledge is from God, no doubt he knows all the thoughts of the children of men, and knows that the imaginations of the thoughts of men's hearts are only evil, and that continually. Even in good thoughts there is a want of being fixed, which may be called vanity. It concerns us to keep a strict watch over our thoughts, because God takes particular notice of them. Thoughts are words to God.</body></html>
