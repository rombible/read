The psalmist's question is as powerful against modern atheism, under whatever philosophy it shelters itself, as against that of his day. Whatever the source of physical life or moral sense, their <span class= "ital">existence </span>proves the prior existence of an original mind and will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/94.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - <span class="accented">The appeal to Israel.</span> The oppressors thought that their conduct would not be observed by God, or would not be taken into account. The psalmist appeals to them not to be so brutish and foolish (ver. 8), and argues, from the first principles of natural theology, that God must see and hear (ver. 9). If he chastises the heathen, why should he not also punish them (ver. 10)? <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Understand, ye brutish</span> <span class="cmt_word">among the people</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-6.htm">Psalm 92:6</a>). That there were among God's people some so "brutish" as to suppose that God either did not see or did not regard their misdoings, appears also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11, 13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And ye fools, when will ye be wise?</span> When will ye put away your folly, and allow Wisdom to enter into your hearts? She is always crying in the streets: when will ye consent to listen (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-23</a>)? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>94:1-11 We may with boldness appeal to God; for he is the almighty Judge by whom every man is judged. Let this encourage those who suffer wrong, to bear it with silence, committing themselves to Him who judges righteously. These prayers are prophecies, which speak terror to the sons of violence. There will come a day of reckoning for all the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against God, his truths, and ways, and people. It would hardly be believed, if we did not witness it, that millions of rational creatures should live, move, speak, hear, understand, and do what they purpose, yet act as if they believed that God would not punish the abuse of his gifts. As all knowledge is from God, no doubt he knows all the thoughts of the children of men, and knows that the imaginations of the thoughts of men's hearts are only evil, and that continually. Even in good thoughts there is a want of being fixed, which may be called vanity. It concerns us to keep a strict watch over our thoughts, because God takes particular notice of them. Thoughts are words to God.</body></html>
