Regarding the deliverance as accomplished, the psalmist promises a freewill offering (Hengstenberg, Kay, Canon Cook) to God, so soon as he can approach the sanctuary. The phrase used is the ordinary one for sacrifices of thanksgiving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will praise thy Name, O Lord; for it is good</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-9.htm">Psalm 52:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/54.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>54:4-7 Behold, God is mine Helper. If we are for him, he is for us; and if he is for us, we need not fear. Every creature is that to us, and no more, which God makes it to be. The Lord will in due time save his people, and in the mean time he sustains them, and bears them up, so that the spirit he has made shall not fail. There is truth in God's threatenings, as well as in his promises; sinners that repent not, will find it so to their cost. David's present deliverance was an earnest of further deliverance. He speaks of the completion of his deliverance as a thing done, though he had as yet many troubles before him; because, having God's promise for it, he was as sure of it as if it was done already. The Lord would deliver him out of all his troubles. May he help us to bear our cross without repining, and at length bring us to share his victories and glory. Christians never should suffer the voice of praise and thanksgiving to cease in the church of the redeemed.</body></html>
