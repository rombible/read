"Who is he, this King of glory?" and the first, slightly varying its answer, replies, <span class="cmt_word">The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.</span> The epithet, "Lord of hosts" well known at the time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-10.htm">2 Samuel 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18, 26, 27</a>, etc.), made all clear, and, the gates being thrown open, the ark was brought in, and set in its place in the midst of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>). It has been generally recognized that the reception of the ark into the tabernacle on Mount Zion typified the entrance of our Lord into heaven after his ascension, whence our Church appoints this psalm as one of those to be recited on Ascension Day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:7-10 The splendid entry here described, refers to the solemn bringing in of the ark into the tent David pitched for it, or the temple Solomon built for it. We may also apply it to the ascension of Christ into heaven, and the welcome given to him there. Our Redeemer found the gates of heaven shut, but having by his blood made atonement for sin, as one having authority, he demanded entrance. The angels were to worship him, Heb 1:6: they ask with wonder, Who is he? It is answered, that he is strong and mighty; mighty in battle to save his people, and to subdue his and their enemies. We may apply it to Christ's entrance into the souls of men by his word and Spirit, that they may be his temples. Behold, he stands at the door, and knocks, Rev 3:20. The gates and doors of the heart are to be opened to him, as possession is delivered to the rightful owner. We may apply it to his second coming with glorious power. Lord, open the everlasting door of our souls by thy grace, that we may now receive thee, and be wholly thine; and that, at length, we may be numbered with thy saints in glory.</body></html>
