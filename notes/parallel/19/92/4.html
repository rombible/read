But the reference is to the <span class= "ital">works in history, </span>not in <span class= "ital">nature. </span>The psalmist is really expressing his gladness at God's wonders wrought for Israel. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/90-15.htm" title="Make us glad according to the days wherein you have afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.">Psalm 90:15-16</a>," Make us glad <span class= "bld">. . .</span> let thy work appear unto thy servants.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/92.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work.</span> It is difficult to say what "work" is intended.

(So Hengstenberg, Kay, and Cheyne.) <span class="cmt_word">I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</span> A repetition for the sake of emphasis. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/92.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>92:1-6 It is a privilege that we are admitted to praise the Lord, and hope to be accepted in the morning, and every night; not only on sabbath days, but every day; not only in public, but in private, and in our families. Let us give thanks every morning for the mercies of the night, and every night for the mercies of the day; going out, and coming in, let us bless God. As He makes us glad, through the works of his providence for us, and of his grace in us, and both through the great work of redemption, let us hence be encouraged. As there are many who know not the designs of Providence, nor care to know them, those who through grace do so, have the more reason to be thankful. And if distant views of the great Deliverer so animated believers of old, how should we abound in love and praise!</body></html>
