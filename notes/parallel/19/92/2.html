The Mosaic Law provided for it by the establishment of the morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38, 39</a>), with the accompanying ritual. Jewish piety added a noonday prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), and Christian zeal established the "seven hours of prayer." Morning and evening still, however, remain, by common acknowledgment, the most appropriate times for worship. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/92.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>92:1-6 It is a privilege that we are admitted to praise the Lord, and hope to be accepted in the morning, and every night; not only on sabbath days, but every day; not only in public, but in private, and in our families. Let us give thanks every morning for the mercies of the night, and every night for the mercies of the day; going out, and coming in, let us bless God. As He makes us glad, through the works of his providence for us, and of his grace in us, and both through the great work of redemption, let us hence be encouraged. As there are many who know not the designs of Providence, nor care to know them, those who through grace do so, have the more reason to be thankful. And if distant views of the great Deliverer so animated believers of old, how should we abound in love and praise!</body></html>
