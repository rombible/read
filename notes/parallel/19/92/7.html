The difficulty is that which disturbed Job (Job 21:7-21) and Asaph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2-15</a>), viz. the prosperity of the wicked. The present writer, however, is not disturbed - he sees in their prosperous condition nothing but a prelude to their overthrow. <span class="cmt_word">And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;</span> or, "do blossom." <span class="cmt_word">It is that they shall be destroyed forever;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it is for their destruction forever</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-20</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/92.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>92:7-15 God sometimes grants prosperity to wicked men in displeasure; yet they flourish but for a moment. Let us seek for ourselves the salvation and grace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, we may behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps them alive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sure evidence of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth the Divine faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lord our righteousness.</body></html>
