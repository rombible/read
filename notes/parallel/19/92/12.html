"Of all vegetable forms," says Humboldt, "the palm is that to which the prize of beauty has been assigned by the concurrent voice of nations in all ages" ('Aspects of Nature,' vol. 2. p. 20, Engl. trans.). Its stately growth, and graceful form, its perpetual verdure, its lovely and luxuriant fruit, together with its manifold uses (Strabo, 16:1, &sect; 14), give it precedence over all other vegetable growths in the eyes that are accustomed to rest upon it. It is rather remarkable that, in the Old Testament, it is used as a figure for beauty only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-7.htm">Song of Solomon 7:7</a>. Man, in his most flourishing growth, is ordinarily compared either to the cedar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/5-15.htm">Song of Solomon 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a>, etc.)or the olive tree (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon</span> (see, besides the passages already quoted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-1.htm">Zechariah 11:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/92.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>92:7-15 God sometimes grants prosperity to wicked men in displeasure; yet they flourish but for a moment. Let us seek for ourselves the salvation and grace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, we may behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps them alive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sure evidence of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth the Divine faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lord our righteousness.</body></html>
