And he searched but found not the images.">Genesis 31:35</a>; to a brother, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-11.htm" title="And Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech you, lay not the sin on us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.">Numbers 12:11</a>; a royal consort, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/1-17.htm" title="And she said to him, My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.">1Kings 1:17-18</a>; to a prince, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-17.htm" title="And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.">1Kings 3:17</a>; with addition of the royal title, "my Lord, O king," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-19.htm" title="And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered and said, As your soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king has spoken: for your servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid:">2Samuel 14:19</a>.<p>The question of the person here intended is, of course, closely bound up with the general question of the authorship and meaning of the psalm. Here the various views that have been held are briefly enumerated:--<p>(1) The Messiah; and, if so, with a prophetic consciousness of His Divinity, or, at least, His superiority as a Prince over all other princes. (2) David himself: this is, of course, inconsistent with the Davidic <span class= "ital">authorship </span>of the psalm. (3) Solomon. (4) Hezekiah. (5) Joshua son of Josedech. (6) One of the priest-kings of the Asmonean dynasty.<p>We now come to the words of the oracle: "Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."<p>Commentators have sought in the customs of Arabia, and even in the mythology of the Greek poets, for proof that this expression denotes viceroyalty or copartnership in the throne. If this meaning could be established from Hebrew literature, these parallels would be confirmatory as well as illustrative; but the nearest approach to be found in the Old Testament only makes the seat at the king's right hand a mark of extreme honour. (See the case of Bath-sheba, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-19.htm" title="Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.">1Kings 2:19</a>; of the queen consort of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm" title="Kings' daughters were among your honorable women: on your right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.">Psalm 45:9</a>; of Jonathan, <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-63.htm" title="And he made him sit by himself, and said into his princes, Go with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that no man complain against him of any matter, and that no man trouble him for any manner of cause.">1 Maccabees 10:63</a>.)<p>Nothing more can be assumed, therefore, from the words themselves than an invitation to sit at Jehovah's right hand to watch the progress of the victorious struggle in which wide and sure dominion is to be won for this Prince. But even this is obscured by the concluding part of the psalm (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm" title="The Lord at your right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.">Psalm 110:5</a>), where Jehovah is said to be at the right hand of the person addressed, and is beyond question represented ac[??] going out with him to battle. Hence, we are led to the conclusion, that the exact position ("at the right hand") i not to be pressed in either case, and that no more is intended than that, with Jehovah's help, the monarch who is the hero of the poem will acquire and administer a vast and glorious realm.<p><span class= "bld">Footstool.</span>--The imagery of the footstool (literally <span class= "ital">a stool for thy feet</span>) is no doubt taken from the custom mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.

Not only he should be superior to all the kings of the earth, but he then existed in glory as the eternal Son of God. Sitting is a resting posture: after services and sufferings, to give law, to give judgment. It is a remaining posture: he sits like a king for ever. All his enemies are now in a chain, but not yet made his footstool. And his kingdom, being set up, shall be kept up in the world, in despite of all the powers of darkness. Christ's people are a willing people. The power of the Spirit, going with the power of the world, to the people of Christs, is effectual to make them willing. They shall attend him in the beautiful attire of holiness; which becomes his house for ever. And he shall have many devoted to him. The dew of our youth, even in the morning of our days, ought to be consecrated to our Lord Jesus. Christ shall not only be a King, but a Priest. He is God's Minister to us, and our Advocate with the Father, and so is the Mediator between God and man. He is a Priest of the order of Melchizedek, which was before that of Aaron, and on many accounts superior to it, and a more lively representation of Christ's priesthood. Christ's sitting at the right hand of God, speaks as much terror to his enemies as happiness to his people. The effect of this victory shall be the utter ruin of his enemies. We have here the Redeemer saving his friends, and comforting them. He shall be humbled; he shall drink of the brook in the way. The wrath of God, running in the curse of the law, may be considered as the brook in the way of his undertaking. Christ drank of the waters of affliction in his way to the throne of glory. But he shall be exalted. What then are we? Has the gospel of Christ been to us the power of God unto salvation? Has his kingdom been set up in our hearts? Are we his willing subjects? Once we knew not our need of his salvation, and we were not willing that he should reign over us. Are we willing to give up every sin, to turn from a wicked, insnaring world, and rely only on his merits and mercy, to have him for our Prophet, Priest, and King? and do we desire to be holy? To those who are thus changed, the Saviour's sacrifice, intercession, and blessing belong.</body></html>
