The Hebrew word is always interrogative; even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-4.htm" title="And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not from where they were:">Joshua 2:4</a> it is indirectly interrogative. But the margin is hardly right in making the whole verse interrogative. Render, <span class= "ital">I will lift up mine eyes to the hills. Whence comes my help? </span>The hills are those on which Jerusalem is built, the plural being understood, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-1.htm" title="His foundation is in the holy mountains.">Psalm 87:1</a>. (See Note.) This gaze of hope does not absolutely decide the standpoint of the poet. He might have been like Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-2.htm" title="Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,">Ezekiel 6:2</a>) when bidden to turn "towards the mountains of Israel" in the distant plain of Mesopotamia; or he may have been close on the end of the pilgrim journey, and actually under the sacred hills. But wherever he stands, this question is not one of doubt; he knows, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-4.htm" title="I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.">Psalm 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 14:7</a>, that help will come from God's holy hill "out of Zion." He puts the question for the sake of the emphatic answer in the next verse. Possibly, as suggested by the marginal rendering and reference, the poet may in his mind have been contrasting the confidence with which a worshipper of Jehovah might look up to the sacred city on the crest of the holy hill with that superstition and idolatry which was associated with so many hills and high places in Canaan. If this is so, the best commentary, both on the poetry and the religion of the psalm, is to be found in Mr. Ruskin's fascinating discourses on mountains in "Modern Painters," their influence on the ancient, mediaeval, and modern mind, and the part they have played alike in the mythology of the pagan times and the religion of the Christian world. There must also be added, in connection with the feeling of the Jew, the part his mountains played as a barrier of defence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm" title="As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.">Psalm 125:2</a>), and as heights of observation from which to watch for the messengers of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm" title="How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace; that brings good tidings of good, that publishes salvation; that said to Zion, Your God reigns!">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-15.htm" title="Behold on the mountains the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace! O Judah, keep your solemn feasts, perform your vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through you; he is utterly cut off.">Nahum 1:15</a>).<p>"In the mountains did he feel his faith<p><span class= "bld">. . .</span> . and there his spirit shaped<p>Her prospects."--WORDSWORTH.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/121.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills</span>. The "holy hills," that stand round about Jerusalem, are intended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-1.htm">Psalm 87:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>). There God had "promised his blessing, even life forevermore" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From whence cometh my help.</span> Most modern critics regard this clause as interrogative, and translate, "Whence is it that my help shall come?" But "the question is only asked to give more effect to the answer" (Cheyne). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/121.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>121:1-8 The safety of the godly. - We must not rely upon men and means, instruments and second causes. Shall I depend upon the strength of the hills? upon princes and great men? No; my confidence is in God only. Or, we must lift up our eyes above the hills; we must look to God who makes all earthly things to us what they are. We must see all our help in God; from him we must expect it, in his own way and time. This psalm teaches us to comfort ourselves in the Lord, when difficulties and dangers are greatest. It is almighty wisdom that contrives, and almighty power that works the safety of those that put themselves under God's protection. He is a wakeful, watchful Keeper; he is never weary; he not only does not sleep, but he does not so much as slumber. Under this shade they may sit with delight and assurance. He is always near his people for their protection and refreshment. The right hand is the working hand; let them but turn to their duty, and they shall find God ready to give them success. He will take care that his people shall not fall. Thou shalt not be hurt, neither by the open assaults, nor by the secret attempts of thine enemies. The Lord shall prevent the evil thou fearest, and sanctify, remove, or lighten the evil thou feelest. He will preserve the soul, that it be not defiled by sin, and disturbed by affliction; he will preserve it from perishing eternally. He will keep thee in life and death; going out to thy labour in the morning of thy days, and coming home to thy rest when the evening of old age calls thee in. It is a protection for life. The Spirit, who is their Preserver and Comforter, shall abide with them for ever. Let us be found in our work, assured that the blessings promised in this psalm are ours.</body></html>
