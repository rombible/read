If the author had been thinking chiefly of his sin as the cause of the reproach of God, surely he would have said "the reproaches of these that reproach <span class= "ital">me </span>are fallen upon <span class= "ital">Thee." </span>The intention seems to be that though in his own eyes a very insignificant and unworthy member of the community, yet being one who burnt with zeal for it, he felt as personally directed against himself all the taunts aimed at Jehovah and His religion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/69.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</span> David's "zeal for God's house" was shown, first, in his establishment of the tabernacle on Mount Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-19</a>); next, in his earnest desire to build a permanent and magnificent dwelling for the ark of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2-5</a>); then, in his careful collection of materials for the building which he was forbidden to erect himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2-5</a>); and finally, in the directions that he left to Solomon with respect to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9, 10, 20</a>). It was also shown, if we take "house" in a wider sense, by his careful government of the land and people, the kingdom and household of God, for forty years. <span class="cmt_word">And the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</span> David may either mean that every reproach uttered against God was as keenly felt by him as if it had been directed against himself, or that, when men reproached him, they really meant to reproach God (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> religion) in him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>69:1-12 We should frequently consider the person of the Sufferer here spoken of, and ask why, as well as what he suffered, that, meditating thereon, we may be more humbled for sin, and more convinced of our danger, so that we may feel more gratitude and love, constraining us to live to His glory who died for our salvation. Hence we learn, when in affliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may not be soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hated wrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a world where unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meet with those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. By the satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, he restored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered for our offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjust accusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserve all that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from our foolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of the unkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ, whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by his disciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off the honours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal for the truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, and cause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.</body></html>
