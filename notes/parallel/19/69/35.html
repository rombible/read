The psalmist merely means that the same God from whom he now confidently expects deliverance will always watch over his city, over his people, over his inheritance, and <span class="accented">whenever</span> danger threatens, will exert his protecting power and save. Prophecies of this kind are always conditional, and thus Zion, when she rejected God for idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>), and again when she rejected him for Barabbas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-21.htm">Matthew 27:21</a>), forfeited the promised blessing of continuance, and brought about her own destruction. <span class="cmt_word">And will build the cities of Judah;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> maintain them, keep them from decay and ruin. <span class="cmt_word">That they may dwell there;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> continue to inhabit the cities. <span class="cmt_word">And have it</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Zion, or Jerusalem) in possession. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>69:30-36 The psalmist concludes the psalm with holy joy and praise, which he began with complaints of his grief. It is a great comfort to us, that humble and thankful praises are more pleasing to God than the most costly, pompous sacrifices. The humble shall look to him, and be glad; those that seek him through Christ shall live and be comforted. God will do great things for the gospel church, in which let all who wish well to it rejoice. A seed shall serve him on earth, and his servants shall inherit his heavenly kingdom. Those that love his name shall dwell before him for ever. He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? Arise, thou great Restorer of the ancient places to dwell in, and turn away ungodliness from thy people.</body></html>
