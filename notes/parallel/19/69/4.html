At the same time the parallelism would be improved by adopting, as Ewald suggests, the Syriac reading "my enemies without are more numerous than my bones," and the construction would be the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-12.htm" title="For innumerable evils have compassed me about: my iniquities have taken hold on me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart fails me.">Psalm 40:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Wrongfully.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">without cause. </span>Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm" title="Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.">Psalm 35:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Then I restored.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">what I did not steal I must then restore, </span>possibly a proverbial saying to express harsh and unjust treatment. Comp. Ps. Xxxv. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm" title="Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them does curse me.">Jeremiah 15:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/69.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>; and for the simile. comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-12.htm">Psalm 40:12</a>; both of them Davidical compositions). <span class="cmt_word">They that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty.</span> Joab and Abiathar, who supported the rebellion of Adonijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>), and were "mighty" men, certainly were David's enemies "wrongfully." And the same may be said of Absalom and Ahithophel. <span class="cmt_word">Then I restored that which I took not away.</span> Dr. Kay supposes David's quasi-abdication of a crown which he had not placed on his own head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14-17</a>) to be alluded to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>69:1-12 We should frequently consider the person of the Sufferer here spoken of, and ask why, as well as what he suffered, that, meditating thereon, we may be more humbled for sin, and more convinced of our danger, so that we may feel more gratitude and love, constraining us to live to His glory who died for our salvation. Hence we learn, when in affliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may not be soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hated wrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a world where unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meet with those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. By the satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, he restored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered for our offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjust accusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserve all that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from our foolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of the unkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ, whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by his disciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off the honours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal for the truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, and cause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.</body></html>
