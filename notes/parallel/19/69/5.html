According to the teaching both of the Old Testament (Proverbs, <span class="accented">passim</span>) and of the New (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-22.htm">Mark 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>, etc.), folly is a form of sin. <span class="cmt_word">And my sins are not hid from thee.</span> The rebuke of Nathan and the death of his child (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7-19</a>) had fully convinced David of this. Thenceforward his sins were ever before him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>), continually confessed by him, and felt to be as well known to God as to himself. Compare the opening of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>:, "Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether" (vers. 1-4). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>69:1-12 We should frequently consider the person of the Sufferer here spoken of, and ask why, as well as what he suffered, that, meditating thereon, we may be more humbled for sin, and more convinced of our danger, so that we may feel more gratitude and love, constraining us to live to His glory who died for our salvation. Hence we learn, when in affliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may not be soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hated wrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a world where unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meet with those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. By the satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, he restored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered for our offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjust accusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserve all that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from our foolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of the unkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ, whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by his disciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off the honours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal for the truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, and cause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.</body></html>
