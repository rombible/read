In the psalmist's mouth the words would correspond to the ideas current when he wrote. From the next clause, <span class= "ital">Let them not be written with the righteous, </span>it might be argued that the idea had already appeared which limited the resurrection to the righteous--an idea current at the date of <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-14.htm" title="So when he was ready to die he said thus, It is good, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised up again by him: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection to life.">2 Maccabees 7:14</a>, but probably familiar to some minds much sooner.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/69.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them be blotted out of the Book of the living.</span> God is supposed to have a "book of the living" in his possession, which contains the names of all those on whom he looks with favour, and whom he will bless both in this world and beyond the grave (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-6.htm">Psalm 86:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>).

Verses 22,23, are applied to the judgments of God upon the unbelieving Jews, in Ro 11:9,10. When the supports of life and delights of sense, through the corruption of our nature, are made the food and fuel of sin, then our table is a snare. Their sin was, that they would not see, but shut their eyes against the light, loving darkness rather; their punishment was, that they should not see, but should be given up to their own hearts' lusts which hardened them. Those who reject God's great salvation proffered to them, may justly fear that his indignation will be poured out upon them. If men will sin, the Lord will reckon for it. But those that have multiplied to sin, may yet find mercy, through the righteousness of the Mediator. God shuts not out any from that righteousness; the gospel excludes none who do not, by unbelief, shut themselves out. But those who are proud and self-willed, so that they will not come in to God's righteousness, shall have their doom accordingly; they themselves decide it. Let those not expect any benefit thereby, who are not glad to be beholden to it. It is better to be poor and sorrowful, with the blessing of the Lord, than rich and jovial, and under his curse. This may be applied to Christ. He was, when on earth, a man of sorrows that had not where to lay his head; but God exalted him. Let us call upon the Lord, and though poor and sorrowful, guilty and defiled, his salvation will set us up on high.</body></html>
