The former supposition certainly adds a fresh force to the prayer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-29.htm" title="But I am poor and sorrowful: let your salvation, O God, set me up on high.">Psalm 69:29</a>; and it is more natural to suppose that the string of curses, once ended, should not be taken up again. On the other hand, would the apostates, against whom the psalm is directed, have put their animosity into the shape of a wish to have names blotted out of God's book? If so, it must be in irony.<p>(27) <span class= "bld">Add iniquity</span>--This may be understood in two different senses: (1) <span class= "ital">Let sin be added to sin in thy account, till the tale be full. </span>(2) <span class= "ital">Add guilt for guilt, i.e., for each wrong committed write down a punishment.</span><p><span class= "bld">And let them not . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>let them not be justified in thy sight; not gain their cause at thy tribunal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/69.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Add iniquity unto their iniquity.</span> Either "let them fall from one wickedness to another," as the clause is rendered in the Prayer book Version; or "add to the record of their sin in thy book, a further record of other sins, as they commit them." <span class="cmt_word">And let them not come into thy righteousness;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let them not receive the gift of thy justifying grace, and so be counted among thy righteous ones. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>69:22-29 These are prophecies of the destruction of Christ's persecutors. Verses 22,23, are applied to the judgments of God upon the unbelieving Jews, in Ro 11:9,10. When the supports of life and delights of sense, through the corruption of our nature, are made the food and fuel of sin, then our table is a snare. Their sin was, that they would not see, but shut their eyes against the light, loving darkness rather; their punishment was, that they should not see, but should be given up to their own hearts' lusts which hardened them. Those who reject God's great salvation proffered to them, may justly fear that his indignation will be poured out upon them. If men will sin, the Lord will reckon for it. But those that have multiplied to sin, may yet find mercy, through the righteousness of the Mediator. God shuts not out any from that righteousness; the gospel excludes none who do not, by unbelief, shut themselves out. But those who are proud and self-willed, so that they will not come in to God's righteousness, shall have their doom accordingly; they themselves decide it. Let those not expect any benefit thereby, who are not glad to be beholden to it. It is better to be poor and sorrowful, with the blessing of the Lord, than rich and jovial, and under his curse. This may be applied to Christ. He was, when on earth, a man of sorrows that had not where to lay his head; but God exalted him. Let us call upon the Lord, and though poor and sorrowful, guilty and defiled, his salvation will set us up on high.</body></html>
