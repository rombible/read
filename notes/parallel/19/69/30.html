Confident of receiving the deliverance for which he has prayed, he anticipates it by at once offering thanksgiving (ver. 30). He then calls on others to rejoice with him, first on the poor and humble (vers. 32, 33), then on heaven and earth and their inhabitants generally (ver. 34).

It is a great comfort to us, that humble and thankful praises are more pleasing to God than the most costly, pompous sacrifices. The humble shall look to him, and be glad; those that seek him through Christ shall live and be comforted. God will do great things for the gospel church, in which let all who wish well to it rejoice. A seed shall serve him on earth, and his servants shall inherit his heavenly kingdom. Those that love his name shall dwell before him for ever. He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? Arise, thou great Restorer of the ancient places to dwell in, and turn away ungodliness from thy people.</body></html>
