He therefore approaches God in what he hopes is "an acceptable time" (ver. 13), and humbly entreats for mercy (vers. 14-18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord, in an acceptable time</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). Professor Cheyne asks, "How has it been revealed to the psalmist that this is an acceptable time?" We can only answer - Perhaps it has not been revealed; he may express a hope rather than a full assurance. Or it may have been revealed to him in the way that other things were. <span class="cmt_word">O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me;</span> or, "in the <span class="accented">greatness</span> of thy mercy;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as thy mercy is so great. <span class="cmt_word">In the truth of thy salvation.</span> "In the exercise of that fidelity which secures the salvation of all that trust it" (Professor Alexander). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>69:13-21 Whatever deep waters of affliction or temptation we sink into, whatever floods of trouble or ungodly men seem ready to overwhelm us, let us persevere in prayer to our Lord to save us. The tokens of God's favour to us are enough to keep our spirits from sinking in the deepest outward troubles. If we think well of God, and continue to do so under the greatest hardships, we need not fear but he will do well for us. And if at any time we are called on to suffer reproach and shame, for Christ's sake, this may be our comfort, that he knows it. It bears hard on one that knows the worth of a good name, to be oppressed with a bad one; but when we consider what a favour it is to be accounted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus, we shall see that there is no reason why it should be heart-breaking to us. The sufferings of Christ were here particularly foretold, which proves the Scripture to be the word of God; and how exactly these predictions were fulfilled in Jesus Christ, which proves him to be the true Messiah. The vinegar and the gall given to him, were a faint emblem of that bitter cup which he drank up, that we might drink the cup of salvation. We cannot expect too little from men, miserable comforters are they all; nor can we expect too much from the God of all comfort and consolation.</body></html>
