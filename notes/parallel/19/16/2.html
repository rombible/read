This appears (1) from the actual existence of various readings, (2) by the variations in the ancient versions, both from the Hebrew and each other. It will be best to take <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/16-2.htm" title="O my soul, you have said to the LORD, You are my Lord: my goodness extends not to you;">Psalm 16:2-3</a> together first. The consensus of the ancient versions in favour of the first person, "I said," instead of "thou hast said" (the italicised words <span class= "ital">O my soul, </span>are a mere gloss from the Chaldee), gives for <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm" title="O my soul, you have said to the LORD, You are my Lord: my goodness extends not to you;">Psalm 16:2</a> the plain and intelligible rendering<p>I said to Jehovah, Thou art my Lord,<p>I have no good besides thee.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-3.htm" title="But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.">Psalm 16:3</a> also requires emendation, being quite unintelligible as it stands. The simplest device is to omit the conjunction and recognise one of those changes of person so agreeable to Hebrew, when the verse will run--<p>"And of the saints who are in the earth,<p>They are the excellent in whom is all my delight."<p>The Authorised Version, in inserting "extendeth," introduces the fine thought that<p>"Merit lives from man to man.<p>And not from man, O God, to Thee;"<p>but it could not have been the thought of the original, since "my good," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5-6</a> show, equals "happiness," not "conduct."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord</span>. The ordinary Hebrew text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>, "thou hast said," requires the insertion of "O my soul," or something similar. But if we read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> with a large number of manuscripts, with the LXX., the Vulgate, the Syriac, and most other versions, no insertion will be necessary. The meaning will then be, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have said to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou art my Lord</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">adonai</span> - "my Lord and Master." <span class="cmt_word">My goodness extendeth not to thee</span>. This meaning cannot be elicited from the Hebrew words. <span class="accented">Tobah is</span> not "goodness," but "prosperity" or "happiness" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-5.htm">Psalm 106:5</a>); and '<span class="accented">aleyka</span> is best explained as "beside thee," "beyond thee." The psalmist means to say that he has no happiness beside (or apart from) God. (So Ewald, Hengstenberg, Cheyne, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' and the Revised Version.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-11 This psalm begins with expressions of devotion, which may be applied to Christ; but ends with such confidence of a resurrection, as must be applied to Christ, and to him only. - David flees to God's protection, with cheerful, believing confidence. Those who have avowed that the Lord is their Lord, should often put themselves in mind of what they have done, take the comfort of it, and live up to it. He devotes himself to the honour of God, in the service of the saints. Saints on earth we must be, or we shall never be saints in heaven. Those renewed by the grace of God, and devoted to the glory of God, are saints on earth. The saints in the earth are excellent ones, yet some of them so poor, that they needed to have David's goodness extended to them. David declares his resolution to have no fellowship with the works of darkness; he repeats the solemn choice he had made of God for his portion and happiness, takes to himself the comfort of the choice, and gives God the glory of it. This is the language of a devout and pious soul. Most take the world for their chief good, and place their happiness in the enjoyments of it; but how poor soever my condition is in this world, let me have the love and favour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have a title by promise to life and happiness in the future state; and I have enough. Heaven is an inheritance; we must take that for our home, our rest, our everlasting good, and look upon this world to be no more ours, than the country through which is our road to our Father's house. Those that have God for their portion, have a goodly heritage. Return unto thy rest, O my soul, and look no further. Gracious persons, though they still covet more of God, never covet more than God; but, being satisfied of his loving-kindness, are abundantly satisfied with it: they envy not any their carnal mirth and delights. But so ignorant and foolish are we, that if left to ourselves, we shall forsake our own mercies for lying vanities. God having given David counsel by his word and Spirit, his own thoughts taught him in the night season, and engaged him by faith to live to God. Verses 8-11, are quoted by St. Peter in his first sermon, after the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2:25-31; he declared that David in them speaks concerning Christ, and particularly of his resurrection. And Christ being the Head of the body, the church, these verses may be applied to all Christians, guided and animated by the Spirit of Christ; and we may hence learn, that it is our wisdom and duty to set the Lord always before us. And if our eyes are ever toward God, our hearts and tongues may ever rejoice in him. Death destroys the hope of man, but not the hope of a real Christian. Christ's resurrection is an earnest of the believer's resurrection. In this world sorrow is our lot, but in heaven there is joy, a fulness of joy; our pleasures here are for a moment, but those at God's right hand are pleasures for evermore. Through this thy beloved Son, and our dear Saviour, thou wilt show us, O Lord, the path of life; thou wilt justify our souls now, and raise our bodies by thy power at the last day; when earthly sorrow shall end in heavenly joy, pain in everlasting happiness.</body></html>
