The received Heb. text has the word in the plural, but with the marginal note that the sign of the plural is superfluous. The weight of MS. authority of all the ancient versions, and of the quotations <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm" title="Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-35.htm" title="Why he said also in another psalm, You shall not suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 13:35</a>, is for the singular.<p><span class= "bld">Corruption.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">shachath, </span>a pit (from root, meaning <span class= "ital">to sink in</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm" title="He made a pit, and dig it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.">Psalm 7:15</a>, where LXX. rightly "abyss," though here and generally "destruction (not "corruption"), as if from <span class= "ital">shakhath,</span> "to destroy." Even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm" title="I have said to corruption, You are my father: to the worm, You are my mother, and my sister.">Job 17:14</a> "the pit" would give as good a parallelism to "worm" as "corruption." The meaning of the passage is clearly that Jehovah will not abandon His beloved to death. "To be left to Sheol" and "to see the pit" are synonyms for "to die," just as "to see life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm" title="Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of the life of your vanity, which he has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity: for that is your portion in this life, and in your labor which you take under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>, Authorised Version, "live joyfully") is "to be alive;" or, as in next clause, "to make to see the path of life." At the same time we discern here the first faint scintillation of that light of immortality which we see struggling to break through the darkness in all the later literature of Israel; the veil over the future of the individual, if not lifted, is stirred by the morning breath of a larger faith, and so the use is justified which is made of this passage in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-25.htm" title="For David speaks concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:">Acts 2:25</a>). (See <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to Sheol</span>, or "to Hades." The confidence in a future life shown here is beyond that exhibited by Job. Job hopes that he may not always remain in Hades, but may one day experience a "change" or "renewal" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a>); David is certain that his soul will not be left in hell. Hell (<span class="accented">Sheol</span>) is to him an "intermediate state," through which a man passes between his life in this world and his final condition in some blest abode. <span class="cmt_word">Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption</span>. The present Hebrew text has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span>, "thy holy ones," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thy saints generally; but the majority, of the manuscripts, all the ancient versions, and even the Hebrew revised text (the Keri) have the word in the singular number, thus agreeing with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35</a>, which give us the translation, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and declare the psalmist to have spoken determinately of Christ. Certainly he would not have spoken of himself as "God's holy one." The translation of <span class="accented">shachath</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) by "corruption" has been questioned, and it has been rendered "the pit," or "the grave," but quite gratuitously. The LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span> as the equivalent; and the rabbinical commentators, giving it the same meaning, but expounding it of David, invented the myth that David's body was miraculously preserved from corruption. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-11 This psalm begins with expressions of devotion, which may be applied to Christ; but ends with such confidence of a resurrection, as must be applied to Christ, and to him only. - David flees to God's protection, with cheerful, believing confidence. Those who have avowed that the Lord is their Lord, should often put themselves in mind of what they have done, take the comfort of it, and live up to it. He devotes himself to the honour of God, in the service of the saints. Saints on earth we must be, or we shall never be saints in heaven. Those renewed by the grace of God, and devoted to the glory of God, are saints on earth. The saints in the earth are excellent ones, yet some of them so poor, that they needed to have David's goodness extended to them. David declares his resolution to have no fellowship with the works of darkness; he repeats the solemn choice he had made of God for his portion and happiness, takes to himself the comfort of the choice, and gives God the glory of it. This is the language of a devout and pious soul. Most take the world for their chief good, and place their happiness in the enjoyments of it; but how poor soever my condition is in this world, let me have the love and favour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have a title by promise to life and happiness in the future state; and I have enough. Heaven is an inheritance; we must take that for our home, our rest, our everlasting good, and look upon this world to be no more ours, than the country through which is our road to our Father's house. Those that have God for their portion, have a goodly heritage. Return unto thy rest, O my soul, and look no further. Gracious persons, though they still covet more of God, never covet more than God; but, being satisfied of his loving-kindness, are abundantly satisfied with it: they envy not any their carnal mirth and delights. But so ignorant and foolish are we, that if left to ourselves, we shall forsake our own mercies for lying vanities. God having given David counsel by his word and Spirit, his own thoughts taught him in the night season, and engaged him by faith to live to God. Verses 8-11, are quoted by St. Peter in his first sermon, after the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2:25-31; he declared that David in them speaks concerning Christ, and particularly of his resurrection. And Christ being the Head of the body, the church, these verses may be applied to all Christians, guided and animated by the Spirit of Christ; and we may hence learn, that it is our wisdom and duty to set the Lord always before us. And if our eyes are ever toward God, our hearts and tongues may ever rejoice in him. Death destroys the hope of man, but not the hope of a real Christian. Christ's resurrection is an earnest of the believer's resurrection. In this world sorrow is our lot, but in heaven there is joy, a fulness of joy; our pleasures here are for a moment, but those at God's right hand are pleasures for evermore. Through this thy beloved Son, and our dear Saviour, thou wilt show us, O Lord, the path of life; thou wilt justify our souls now, and raise our bodies by thy power at the last day; when earthly sorrow shall end in heavenly joy, pain in everlasting happiness.</body></html>
