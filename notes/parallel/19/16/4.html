The literal text runs <span class= "ital">Their sorrows </span>[or, <span class= "ital">idols</span>] (<span class= "ital">fem.</span>)<span class= "ital"> are multiplied </span>(<span class= "ital">masc</span>)<span class= "ital">; another they hasten </span>[or, <span class= "ital">change</span>].<span class= "ital"> I will not pour out their libations from blood, and will not take their names upon my lips, </span>which, with one or two slight changes in the punctuation, becomes--<p>"They shall multiply their sorrows<p>Who change to another god:<p>I will not pour out their bloody libations,<p>Nor take their names on my lips."<p>At the same time, from the evident allusion to the curse on Eve in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a>, and the fact that the verb rendered "hasten" (comp. margin) means to buy a wife, it seems that the psalmist had the common prophetical figure for idolatry, viz., adultery, in his mind; but as he is not speaking of the Church as a whole, he does not work it out as the prophets do, by representing the idolaters as adulteresses.<p>The "libations of blood" seem to refer to the ghastly rites of Moloch and Chemosh. For the last clause comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-13.htm" title="And in all things that I have said to you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.">Exodus 23:13</a>. To the Hebrews the very name of a god included a predication of his power. Hence the avoidance of even mentioning <span class= "ital">baal, </span>but substituting <span class= "ital">bosheth, i.e., </span>shameful thing, for it, even in proper names.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god</span>. This is the only note of sadness in the entire psalm, and it is inserted to add force by contrast to the joyous outburst in ver. 5. If men would not cleave to Jehovah, but would "hasten after" - or perhaps it should be translated "wed themselves to" - another god (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>, the only other place where the word occurs), then they must not expect "prosperity," or joy of any kind. Their "sorrows will be multiplied;" distress and anguish will come upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>); they will have to pay dear for their apostasy. <span class="cmt_word">Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer.</span> Drink offerings of actual blood are not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, and there is very little evidence of their having been offered by any of the heathen nations, though it is conjectured that they may have been employed in the worship of Moloch. It is therefore best to explain the expression, as here used, metaphorically, as drink offerings as hateful as if they had been of blood (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor take up their names into my lips</span>. By "their names" we must understand the names which they used - those by which they called their gods. The Law forbade the mention of these names by Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-11 This psalm begins with expressions of devotion, which may be applied to Christ; but ends with such confidence of a resurrection, as must be applied to Christ, and to him only. - David flees to God's protection, with cheerful, believing confidence. Those who have avowed that the Lord is their Lord, should often put themselves in mind of what they have done, take the comfort of it, and live up to it. He devotes himself to the honour of God, in the service of the saints. Saints on earth we must be, or we shall never be saints in heaven. Those renewed by the grace of God, and devoted to the glory of God, are saints on earth. The saints in the earth are excellent ones, yet some of them so poor, that they needed to have David's goodness extended to them. David declares his resolution to have no fellowship with the works of darkness; he repeats the solemn choice he had made of God for his portion and happiness, takes to himself the comfort of the choice, and gives God the glory of it. This is the language of a devout and pious soul. Most take the world for their chief good, and place their happiness in the enjoyments of it; but how poor soever my condition is in this world, let me have the love and favour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have a title by promise to life and happiness in the future state; and I have enough. Heaven is an inheritance; we must take that for our home, our rest, our everlasting good, and look upon this world to be no more ours, than the country through which is our road to our Father's house. Those that have God for their portion, have a goodly heritage. Return unto thy rest, O my soul, and look no further. Gracious persons, though they still covet more of God, never covet more than God; but, being satisfied of his loving-kindness, are abundantly satisfied with it: they envy not any their carnal mirth and delights. But so ignorant and foolish are we, that if left to ourselves, we shall forsake our own mercies for lying vanities. God having given David counsel by his word and Spirit, his own thoughts taught him in the night season, and engaged him by faith to live to God. Verses 8-11, are quoted by St. Peter in his first sermon, after the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2:25-31; he declared that David in them speaks concerning Christ, and particularly of his resurrection. And Christ being the Head of the body, the church, these verses may be applied to all Christians, guided and animated by the Spirit of Christ; and we may hence learn, that it is our wisdom and duty to set the Lord always before us. And if our eyes are ever toward God, our hearts and tongues may ever rejoice in him. Death destroys the hope of man, but not the hope of a real Christian. Christ's resurrection is an earnest of the believer's resurrection. In this world sorrow is our lot, but in heaven there is joy, a fulness of joy; our pleasures here are for a moment, but those at God's right hand are pleasures for evermore. Through this thy beloved Son, and our dear Saviour, thou wilt show us, O Lord, the path of life; thou wilt justify our souls now, and raise our bodies by thy power at the last day; when earthly sorrow shall end in heavenly joy, pain in everlasting happiness.</body></html>
