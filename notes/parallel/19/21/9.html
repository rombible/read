But, as if startled by the boldness of his own figure, the poet instantly refers to Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">In his wrath.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in his nostril, </span>in direct parallelism with "face" in last clause.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of his anger</span>. Some suppose a reference to the event mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>, "He (David) made them (the Ammonites) to pass through the <span class="accented">brick-kiln.</span>;" but the expression "fiery oven" is probably not intended to be taken literally, but metaphorically. Severe suffering is continually compared in Scripture to confinement in an oven or furnace (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-51.htm">1 Kings 8:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Ezekiel 22:18, 20, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). And we may best understand the present passage to mean simply that in the time of his anger David would subject such of his enemies as fell into his hands to very terrible sufferings. (See, as showing what extreme severities David did sometimes inflict on captured enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a> which is to the point, as also is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</span> The metaphor is followed up, with the addition that what was previously attributed to David alone is here declared to have the sanction of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:7-13 The psalmist teaches to look forward with faith, and hope, and prayer upon what God would further do. The success with which God blessed David, was a type of the total overthrow of all Christ's enemies. Those who might have had Christ to rule and save them, but rejected him and fought against him, shall find the remembrance of it a worm that dies not. God makes sinners willing by his grace, receives them to his favour, and delivers them from the wrath to come. May he exalt himself, by his all-powerful grace, in our hearts, destroying all the strong-holds of sin and Satan. How great should be our joy and praise to behold our Brother and Friend upon the throne, and for all the blessings we may expect from him! yet he delights in his exalted state, as enabling him to confer happiness and glory on poor sinners, who are taught to love and trust in him.</body></html>
