The word "prevent" is familiar in this sense in the English collect: "Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm" title="O remember not against us former iniquities: let your tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.">Psalm 79:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>.) The "crown "is by some identified with that won by David at Rabbah Moab. Others make it refer to a coronation. Ewald thinks of a birthday celebration. Probably no more is intended than a symbol of victory and rejoicing. Maidens were accustomed to meet a monarch returning in victory, and to offer a <span class= "ital">crown, </span>or <span class= "ital">garland, </span>which was a symbol of extraordinary rejoicing. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-11.htm" title="The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.">Psalm 68:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/3-11.htm" title="Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.">Song of Solomon 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-8.htm" title="Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:">Wisdom Of Solomon 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/judith/15-13.htm" title="And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid that was with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armour with garlands, and with songs in their mouths.">Judith 15:13</a>; 3Ma 7:16.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou givest him blessings before he asks, and more than he asks.. "The blessings of goodness" is pleonastic, since a blessing cannot be otherwise than a good. <span class="cmt_word">Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head</span>. It is remarked that David, as the result of one of his wars, did actually take the crown of the conquered king, which was a crown of gold, from off the king' s head, and place it upon his own head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>); but this is scarcely what is intended here. As Hengstenberg observes, "The setting on of the crown marks the bestowment of dominion," not in one petty ease only, but generally, and is scarcely to be altogether separated from the promises recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-6 Happy the people whose king makes God's strength his confidence, and God's salvation his joy; who is pleased with all the advancements of God kingdom, and trusts God to support him in all he does for the service of it. All our blessings are blessings of goodness, and are owing, not to any merit of ours, but only to God's goodness. But when God's blessings come sooner, and prove richer than we imagine; when they are given before we prayed for them, before we were ready for them, nay, when we feared the contrary; then it may be truly said that he prevented, or went before us, with them. Nothing indeed prevented, or went before Christ, but to mankind never was any favour more preventing than our redemption by Christ. Thou hast made him to be a universal, everlasting blessing to the world, in whom the families of the earth are, and shall be blessed; and so thou hast made him exceeding glad with the countenance thou hast given to his undertaking, and to him in the prosecution of it. The Spirit of prophecy rises from what related to the king, to that which is peculiar to Christ; none other is blessed for ever, much less a blessing for ever.</body></html>
