Plainly, then, the "Cedron" is not here alluded to. But many commentators think "Siloam" is intended. (See Stanley, <span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine, </span>p. 180, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-3.htm" title="Therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of salvation.">Isaiah 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.">Ezekiel 47:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>.)<p>There may not, however, be any such local allusion. The river, flowing calmly and smoothly along, may be only a symbol of the peace and blessing of the Divine presence, as the tumult and tempest of the sea in the last verse are of the world's noisy troubles. Indeed, the LXX. (comp. Prayer Book version) seems to connect the river of this verse with the waters of the preceding.<p><span class= "bld">Streams.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm" title="And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the same word occurs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a river, the streams</span> <span class="cmt_word">whereof shall make glad the city of God. </span> In contrast with the scene of tumult and disturbance in the world at large, which the writer has presented to us in vers. 2, 3, he now shows us, resting in perfect peace and tranquillity, "the city of God," threatened, indeed, by the nations, but undismayed by them, and calmly trusting in the protection of the God who is "in the midst of her." To this city he assigns a "river, the streams whereof make her glad;" imagery in which we may recognize the perennial fountain of God's grace - that "pure river of water of life," which, welling forth from the throne of God and of the Lamb, continually refreshes and gladdens the Church of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>), whether her dwell-tug-place be the earthly or the heavenly Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>).

We may apply it to spiritual enemies, and the encouragement we have that, through Christ, we shall be conquerors over them. He is a Help, a present Help, a Help found, one whom we have found to be so; a Help at hand, one that is always near; we cannot desire a better, nor shall we ever find the like in any creature. Let those be troubled at the troubling of the waters, who build their confidence on a floating foundation; but let not those be alarmed who are led to the Rock, and there find firm footing. Here is joy to the church, even in sorrowful times. The river alludes to the graces and consolations of the Holy Spirit, which flow through every part of the church, and through God's sacred ordinances, gladdening the heart of every believer. It is promised that the church shall not be moved. If God be in our hearts, by his word dwelling richly in us, we shall be established, we shall be helped; let us trust and not be afraid.</body></html>
