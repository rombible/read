The announcement is very vague and general, so that it would apply to almost any occasion when the people of God were delivered from a pressing peril. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/46.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>46:6-11 Come and see the effects of desolating judgments, and stand in awe of God. This shows the perfect security of the church, and is an assurance of lasting peace. Let us pray for the speedy approach of these glorious days, and in silent submission let us worship and trust in our almighty Sovereign. Let all believers triumph in this, that the Lord of hosts, the God of Jacob, has been, is, and will be with us; and will be our Refuge. Mark this, take the comfort, and say, If God be for us, who can be against us? With this, through life and in death, let us answer every fear.</body></html>
