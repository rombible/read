In connection with this festival psalm the mention of the <span class= "ital">shophar </span>is especially interesting as being the only ancient Hebrew instrument of which the use is still on solemn occasions retained. (See <span class= "ital">Bible Educator, </span>Vol. ii. 242.)<p><span class= "bld">In the new moon.</span>--Standing by itself this might mean the beginning of every month (comp. Num. x 10), and so many scholars are inclined to take it here. Others render "in this month." But see next Note.<p><span class= "bld">In the time appointed.</span>--This is the rendering given of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">k?seh </span>by a long array of authorities. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-20.htm" title="He has taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.">Proverbs 7:20</a>, the only other place where the word is found, the Vulg. gives "after many days;" and while the English margin has "new moon" Aquila and Jerome give "full moon." This latter meaning is supported by the fact that the Syrian version gives <span class= "ital">keso </span>for the 15th day of the month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-32.htm" title="And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.">1Kings 12:32</a>). But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-10.htm" title="And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had showed to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.">2Chronicles 7:10</a> the same word is used for the 23rd day; hence, it is supposed to denote the whole time of the moon's waning from the full. It seems, therefore, hardly possible that <span class= "ital">keseh </span>as well as <span class= "ital">chadesh </span>can mean <span class= "ital">new moon </span>here as some think, though it is strange to find both the <span class= "ital">new </span>and the <span class= "ital">full </span>moon mentioned together. Some remove the difficulty by reading with the Syriac, Chaldee, and several MSS. <span class= "ital">feast-days </span>in the plural, but the authority of the LXX. is against this reading. But apparently the festival in question was the Feast of Tabernacles. The word <span class= "ital">chag </span>here used is said by Gesenius to be in the Talmud used pre-eminently of this feast, as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-3.htm" title="Why all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.">2Chronicles 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm" title="And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.">1Kings 8:2</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm" title="When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy day.">Psalm 42:4</a>), and the Jews, always tenacious of ancient tradition, regularly use this psalm for the office of the 1st day of Tisri. Thus the new moon is that of the seventh month, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm" title="And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets to you.">Numbers 29:1</a> is called especially "a day of trumpet blowing" (sec Note <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-1.htm" title="Sing aloud to God our strength: make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.">Psalm 81:1</a>), and the full moon denotes this feast, (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days:">Numbers 29:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall you have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.">Leviticus 23:24</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/81.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blow up the trumpet in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">new moon.</span> There was a Mowing of trumpets at the beginning of every month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>), in connection with the appointed sacrifices (Leviticus 28:11-15); so that the month intended cannot, so far, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fixed. As, however, the chief blowing of trumpets was on the first day of the seventh month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>), most commentators regard the psalm as composed for this occasion. There are some, however, as Hengstenberg, Professor Cheyne, and Professor Alexander, who consider it to be a Passover psalm. <span class="cmt_word">In the time appointed;</span> rather, <span class="accented">at the full moon; i.e.</span> on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when the Feast of Tabernacles was opened (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a>). Trumpets were probably blown then also. <span class="cmt_word">On our solemn feast day.</span> The Feast of Tabernacles is called <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, "the feast," in many passages of the Old Testament (see Professor Cheyne's comment on this psalm, 'Book of Psalms,' p. 228). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/81.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>81:1-7 All the worship we can render to the Lord is beneath his excellences, and our obligations to him, especially in our redemption from sin and wrath. What God had done on Israel's behalf, was kept in remembrance by public solemnities. To make a deliverance appear more gracious, more glorious, it is good to observe all that makes the trouble we are delivered from appear more grievous. We ought never to forget the base and ruinous drudgery to which Satan, our oppressor, brought us. But when, in distress of conscience, we are led to cry for deliverance, the Lord answers our prayers, and sets us at liberty. Convictions of sin, and trials by affliction, prove his regard to his people. If the Jews, on their solemn feast-days, were thus to call to mind their redemption out of Egypt, much more ought we, on the Christian sabbath, to call to mind a more glorious redemption, wrought out for us by our Lord Jesus Christ, from worse bondage.</body></html>
