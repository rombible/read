The construction of this verse is matter of difficulty. Properly we should render, <span class= "ital">And he fed them with the finest of the wheat, and with honey out of the rock satisfied thee. </span>The change of person is harsh, though perhaps it may be illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-27.htm" title="All the ends of the world shall remember and turn to the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before you.">Psalm 22:27</a>, &c, but the past tense seems out of keeping with the context. The conclusions of Psalms 77, 78 are hardly analogous.

The expression, "honey out of the rock," is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>. It evidently means "honey of the best" - native honey, stored by the bees in clefts of the rocks. Of course, both the "wheat" and the "honey" are metaphors, which we are to regard as shadowing forth all temporal and spiritual blessings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/81.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>81:8-16 We cannot look for too little from the creature, nor too much from the Creator. We may have enough from God, if we pray for it in faith. All the wickedness of the world is owing to man's wilfulness. People are not religious, because they will not be so. God is not the Author of their sin, he leaves them to the lusts of their own hearts, and the counsels of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must be upon themselves. The Lord is unwilling that any should perish. What enemies sinners are to themselves! It is sin that makes our troubles long, and our salvation slow. Upon the same conditions of faith and obedience, do Christians hold those spiritual and eternal good things, which the pleasant fields and fertile hills of Canaan showed forth. Christ is the Bread of life; he is the Rock of salvation, and his promises are as honey to pious minds. But those who reject him as their Lord and Master, must also lose him as their Saviour and their reward.</body></html>
