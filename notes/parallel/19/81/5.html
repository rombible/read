Hence, the LXX., in disregard of use, give "out of Egypt." But <span class= "ital">God </span>is doubtless the subject of the verb, and we may render, <span class= "ital">over the land of Egypt, </span>in allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>, or <span class= "ital">against the land of Egypt, </span>in reference to the Divine hostility to Pharaoh.<p><span class= "bld">Where I heard . . .</span>--The insertion of the relatival adverb, <span class= "ital">where, </span>makes this refer to the Egyptian tongue (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-1.htm" title="When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;">Psalm 114:1</a>), giving an equivalent for, "when I was in a foreign country." So apparently the LXX. and Vulg. But the expression, <span class= "ital">words unknown to me I heard, </span>when followed by an apparent quotation, most naturally introduces that quotation. The poet hears a message, which comes borne to him on the festival music, and this he goes on to deliver.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/81.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony.</span> The special mention of "Joseph" here is strange. Professor Cheyne explains, "God appointed the Law to be valid in northern as well as southern Israel." Hengstenberg and Professor Alexander account for the expression by the pre-eminence of Joseph during the sojourn in Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">When he went out through the land of Egypt</span>. When he (Joseph) went out over (or, across) the land," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the time of the Exodus. <span class="cmt_word">Where I heard a language that I understood not.</span> It can scarcely be supposed that this clause belongs properly to ver. 5. It is rather an introduction to the monody wherewith the psalm (as it has come down to us) concludes - the mournful complaint of God against his people. So Professor Cheyne, who translates, "The discourse of no whom I had not known (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of God) did I hear." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/81.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>81:1-7 All the worship we can render to the Lord is beneath his excellences, and our obligations to him, especially in our redemption from sin and wrath. What God had done on Israel's behalf, was kept in remembrance by public solemnities. To make a deliverance appear more gracious, more glorious, it is good to observe all that makes the trouble we are delivered from appear more grievous. We ought never to forget the base and ruinous drudgery to which Satan, our oppressor, brought us. But when, in distress of conscience, we are led to cry for deliverance, the Lord answers our prayers, and sets us at liberty. Convictions of sin, and trials by affliction, prove his regard to his people. If the Jews, on their solemn feast-days, were thus to call to mind their redemption out of Egypt, much more ought we, on the Christian sabbath, to call to mind a more glorious redemption, wrought out for us by our Lord Jesus Christ, from worse bondage.</body></html>
