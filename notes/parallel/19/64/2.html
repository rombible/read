The first danger is from secret plots, which David knows to be going on against his authority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-12</a>). The second, and greater danger, will be from open insurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1-14</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/64.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>64:1-6 The psalmist earnestly begs of God to preserve him from disquieting fear. The tongue is a little member, but it boasts great things. The upright man is the mark at which the wicked aim, they cannot speak peaceably either of him or to him. There is no guard against a false tongue. It is bad to do wrong, but worse to encourage ourselves and one another in it. It is a sign that the heart is hardened to the greatest degree, when it is thus fully set to do evil. A practical disbelief of God's knowledge of all things, is at the bottom of every wickedness. The benefit of a good cause and a good conscience, appears most when nothing can help a man against his enemies, save God alone, who is always a present help.</body></html>
