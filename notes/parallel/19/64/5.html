We do not know the exact proceedings of his enemies against David at the time, the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a> being so brief; but it was probably by some trickery that David was induced to quit the stronghold of Jerusalem, and so yield the seat of government, and many other advantages, to his rival. <span class="cmt_word">They say, Who shall see them?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>).

The tongue is a little member, but it boasts great things. The upright man is the mark at which the wicked aim, they cannot speak peaceably either of him or to him. There is no guard against a false tongue. It is bad to do wrong, but worse to encourage ourselves and one another in it. It is a sign that the heart is hardened to the greatest degree, when it is thus fully set to do evil. A practical disbelief of God's knowledge of all things, is at the bottom of every wickedness. The benefit of a good cause and a good conscience, appears most when nothing can help a man against his enemies, save God alone, who is always a present help.</body></html>
