In the moment of their imagined success, their deeply-laid schemes just on the point of ripening, a sudden Divine retribution overtakes the wicked, and all their calumnies, invented with such cunning, fall back on their own heads. But the construction is most perplexing. The text presents a tangled maze of abrupt clauses, which, arranged according to the accents, run: <span class= "ital">And God shoots an arrow, sudden are their wounds, and they make it </span>(or <span class= "ital">him</span>)<span class= "ital"> fall on themselves their tongue. </span>The last clause seems to pronounce the law which obtains in Divine judgment. While God orders the retribution it is yet the recoil of their own evil on the guilty. In these cases,<p>"We still have judgment here, that we but teach<p>Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return<p>To plague the inventor; this evenhanded justice<p>Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice<p>To our own lips."<p>SHAKSPEARE: <span class= "ital">Macbeth.</span><p><span class= "bld">Flee away.</span>--The verb (<span class= "ital">n?dad</span>) properly means <span class= "ital">to flutter the wings like a bird </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-14.htm" title="And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathers eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.">Isaiah 10:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/64.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But God shall shoot at them with an arrow.</span> But God <span class="accented">will</span> interpose.

Those who love cursing, it shall come upon them. Those who behold this shall understand, and observe God's hand in all; unless we do so, we are not likely to profit by the dispensations of Providence. The righteous shall be glad in the Lord; not glad of the misery and ruin of their fellow-creatures, but glad that God is glorified, and his word fulfilled, and the cause of injured innocence pleaded effectually. They rejoice not in men, nor in themselves, nor in any creature, or creature enjoyments, nor in their wisdom, strength, riches, or righteousness; but in Christ, in whom all the seed of Israel are justified and glory, and in what he is to them, and has done for them.</body></html>
