But such a sudden intrusion of a Divine utterance, without any notice of a change of speaker, is without parallel in the Psalms, and should certainly not be admitted without some plain necessity. Here is no necessity at all. The words are quite suitable in the mouth of David, as an admonition to the Israelites of his time; they accord with the title, which he himself seems to have prefixed to the psalm, and explain it; and they fulfil the promise made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt</span> <span class="cmt_word">go.</span> We must suppose the "godly man" of ver. 6 addressed, if we regard David as the speaker. Such a man was not beyond the need of instruction and teaching, since he was liable to sins of infirmity, and even to grievous falls, as had been seen by David's example. <span class="cmt_word">I will guide thee with mine</span> <span class="cmt_word">eye;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will keep watch over thee with mine eye, and guide thee as I see to be necessary." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:8-11 God teaches by his word, and guides with the secret intimations of his will. David gives a word of caution to sinners. The reason for this caution is, that the way of sin will certainly end in sorrow. Here is a word of comfort to saints. They may see that a life of communion with God is far the most pleasant and comfortable. Let us rejoice, O Lord Jesus, in thee, and in thy salvation; so shall we rejoice indeed.</body></html>
