(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-15.htm" title="If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of your children.">Psalm 73:15</a>, and Note.) The sense is,<p>"I said, 'I will acknowledge my sin unto thee,<p>And I did not hide mine iniquity.<p>(I said) 'I will confess my transgression unto Jehovah,<p>And thou forgavest the guilt of my sin."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I acknowledged my sin unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>). Conscience once fully awakened, all reticence was broken down. David confessed his sin fully and freely - confessed it as "sin," as "transgression," and as "iniquity" (compare the comment on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">And mine iniquity have I not hid;</span> rather, <span class="accented">did I not hide.</span> I did not attempt to gloss over or conceal the extent of my guilt, but laid my soul bare before thee. Hengstenberg well remarks that the psalmist is probably not speaking of a "making known by the mouth," but of "an inward confession, such as is accompanied with painful repentance and sorrow, with begging of pardon for sin and for the offence rendered to the Divine Majesty." <span class="cmt_word">I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.</span> Upon David's confession, whether it were inward or outward, followed without any interval God's forgiveness - forgiveness which, however, did not preclude the exaction of a penalty required for the justification of God's ways to man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>), and also, perhaps, for proper impressing of the offender himself, who would have been less sensible of the heinousness of his sin, if it had gone unpunished. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:3-7 It is very difficult to bring sinful man humbly to accept free mercy, with a full confession of his sins and self-condemnation. But the true and only way to peace of conscience, is, to confess our sins, that they may be forgiven; to declare them that we may be justified. Although repentance and confession do not merit the pardon of transgression, they are needful to the real enjoyment of forgiving mercy. And what tongue can tell the happiness of that hour, when the soul, oppressed by sin, is enabled freely to pour forth its sorrows before God, and to take hold of his covenanted mercy in Christ Jesus! Those that would speed in prayer, must seek the Lord, when, by his providence, he calls them to seek him, and, by his Spirit, stirs them up to seek him. In a time of finding, when the heart is softened with grief, and burdened with guilt; when all human refuge fails; when no rest can be found to the troubled mind, then it is that God applies the healing balm by his Spirit.</body></html>
