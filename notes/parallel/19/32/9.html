In either case the general application is the same. Horses and mules can only be rendered obedient by restraints that are unworthy of a rational creature. The LXX. and Vulg. have "jaws" instead of "mouth," and Ewald follows them, and renders the last clause, "of those who approach thee unfriendly."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding</span>. The singular is exchanged for the plural, since the "instruction" is now intended, not for the godly man only, but for all. Israel had been always stiff-necked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm">Exodus 33:3, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-8.htm">2 Chronicles 30:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>), like a restive horse or mule. David exhorts them to be so no more. The horse and mule are excusable, since they "have no understanding " - or, "no discernment" - Israel would be inexcusable, since it had the gift of reason. <span class="cmt_word">Whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle</span>; rather, <span class="accented">whose adornings are with bit and bridle to hold them in</span> (compare the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Lest they come near unto thee</span>. This clause is obscure. It may mean, "Lest they come <span class="accented">too</span> near to thee," so as to do thee damage, as when a riding horse tosses his head and strikes the rider in the face, or when a chariot horse rears and falls back upon the driver; or it may mean, "Else they will not come near to thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> until they are trapped with bit and bridle, they will refuse to come near to thee. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/32.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>32:8-11 God teaches by his word, and guides with the secret intimations of his will. David gives a word of caution to sinners. The reason for this caution is, that the way of sin will certainly end in sorrow. Here is a word of comfort to saints. They may see that a life of communion with God is far the most pleasant and comfortable. Let us rejoice, O Lord Jesus, in thee, and in thy salvation; so shall we rejoice indeed.</body></html>
