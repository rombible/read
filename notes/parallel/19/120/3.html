Thus we get in substance the following question: "What more can be added to thee (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the way of epithet), besides <span class= "ital">lying </span>and <span class= "ital">false, thou deceitful tongue</span>?" the answer is given by suggesting the usual metaphors of malicious speech, "the warrior's sharpened arrows" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-8.htm" title="Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in heart he lays his wait.">Jeremiah 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm" title="My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.">Psalm 57:4</a>); "fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm" title="And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.">James 3:6</a>). Only here both images are elaborated. For the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">give </span>with the sense of comparison, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-16.htm" title="Count not your handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken till now.">1Samuel 1:16</a>, "Count (Heb., <span class= "ital">give</span>) not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial." Gesenius compares the use of the Greek <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>, instead of <span class= "greekheb">????????</span>. So, too, the word "add" has a similar sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-7.htm" title="However, I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: your wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I heard.">1Kings 10:7</a>; see margin).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/120.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall be given unto thee?</span> rather, what <span class="accented">shall he</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. God) <span class="accented">give to thee?</span> Or, in other words - What punishment will God inflict on thee for thy false speaking? Or what shall be done unto thee? literally, <span class="accented">or what shall he add</span> to thee? Compare the common phrase, "God do so unto me, and more also" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou false tongue</span>. The "false tongue" is apostrophized, as if it were a living person. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/120.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>120:1-4 The psalmist was brought into great distress by a deceitful tongue. May every good man be delivered from lying lips. They forged false charges against him. In this distress, he sought God by fervent prayer. God can bridle their tongues. He obtained a gracious answer to this prayer. Surely sinners durst not act as they do, if they knew, and would be persuaded to think, what will be in the end thereof. The terrors of the Lord are his arrows; and his wrath is compared to burning coals of juniper, which have a fierce heat, and keep fire very long. This is the portion of the false tongue; for all that love and make a lie, shall have their portion in the lake that burns eternally.</body></html>
