Such was the Oriental notion, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm" title="Ask you of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.">Zechariah 10:1</a> and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-17.htm" title="Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call to the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.">1Samuel 12:17</a>. Both of these places refer to showers out of the ordinary rainy season, such as thunder-storms in the harvest season. The sudden downfall of sheets of rain after a flash and peal is even in this climate sufficiently striking to make such a notion as the dependence of rain on lightning quite conceivable, how much more in tropical countries, and where, except in the due rainy season, it would never probably fall without thunder and lightning.<p><span class= "bld">Wind out of his treasuries.--</span>Comp. the Greek and Latin ideas of the "caves" of the winds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/135.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-16.htm">Jeremiah 51:16</a>) By God's contrivance vapor is continually rising from the remotest regions of the earth, to hang in clouds, descend in rain, and spread abroad fertility. <span class="cmt_word">He maketh lightnings for the rain.</span> To accompany it, perhaps to give it its fertilizing qualities (see Dr. Kay's comment 'The Psalms,' p. 428). <span class="cmt_word">He bringeth the wind out of his treasuries</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>, where God's "treasuries" for the snow and the hail are spoken of; and comp.
