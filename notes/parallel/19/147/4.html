To assemble the dispersed of Israel, however numerous and scattered, was easy to the ruler of the hosts of heaven. The original promise to Abraham was, of course, in the poet's mind, but still more <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26-28</a>, from which the expression may have been taken. The dramatic "Lift your eyes on high and behold" supplies the link needed in the abrupt entrance of the thought of the psalm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/147.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He telleth the number of the stars.</span> Nothing escapes God's knowledge. He knew the number of the exiles, and the place and name of each, just as he knows the number of the stars and their names (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He calleth them all by their names</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>; Isaiah <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/147.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>147:1-11 Praising God is work that is its own wages. It is comely; it becomes us as reasonable creatures, much more as people in covenant with God. He gathers outcast sinners by his grace, and will bring them into his holy habitation. To those whom God heals with the consolations of his Spirit, he speaks peace, assures them their sins are pardoned. And for this, let others praise him also. Man's knowledge is soon ended; but God's knowledge is a dept that can never be fathomed. And while he telleth the number of the stars, he condescends to hear the broken-hearted sinner. While he feeds the young ravens, he will not leave his praying people destitute. Clouds look dull and melancholy, yet without them we could have no rain, therefore no fruit. Thus afflictions look black and unpleasant; but from clouds of affliction come showers that make the soul to yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness. The psalmist delights not in things wherein sinners trust and glory; but a serious and suitable regard to God is, in his sight, of very great price. We are not to be in doubt between hope and fear, but to act under the gracious influences of hope and fear united.</body></html>
