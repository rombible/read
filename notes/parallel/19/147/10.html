The horse as a type of strength and endurance was of course common. (Comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/39-19.htm" title="Have you given the horse strength? have you clothed his neck with thunder?">Job 39:19-25</a>.) And we have before seen that Eastern nations naturally select fleetness of foot as the typical quality in a vigorous warrior. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-33.htm" title="He makes my feet like hinds' feet, and sets me on my high places.">Psalm 18:33</a>.)<p>The constant epithet "swift-footed Achilles," suggests the best explanation of the second clause of the verse. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm" title="And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.">2Samuel 2:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/147.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He delighteth not in the strength of the horse</span>. In a certain sense, God no doubt "delights" in the glory and excellency of all his creatures; but their physical endowments do not give him the sensible pleasure which he derives from the moral qualities of his rational creation (see ver. 11). The negation is not absolute, but relative (compare "I will have mercy, <span class="accented">and not</span> sacrifice"). <span class="cmt_word">He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in his strength and swiftness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/147.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>147:1-11 Praising God is work that is its own wages. It is comely; it becomes us as reasonable creatures, much more as people in covenant with God. He gathers outcast sinners by his grace, and will bring them into his holy habitation. To those whom God heals with the consolations of his Spirit, he speaks peace, assures them their sins are pardoned. And for this, let others praise him also. Man's knowledge is soon ended; but God's knowledge is a dept that can never be fathomed. And while he telleth the number of the stars, he condescends to hear the broken-hearted sinner. While he feeds the young ravens, he will not leave his praying people destitute. Clouds look dull and melancholy, yet without them we could have no rain, therefore no fruit. Thus afflictions look black and unpleasant; but from clouds of affliction come showers that make the soul to yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness. The psalmist delights not in things wherein sinners trust and glory; but a serious and suitable regard to God is, in his sight, of very great price. We are not to be in doubt between hope and fear, but to act under the gracious influences of hope and fear united.</body></html>
