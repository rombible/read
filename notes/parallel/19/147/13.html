The "bars" of the gates of Jerusalem are mentioned in Nehemiah repeatedly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3, 6</a>, 13, 14, 15; 7:3). <span class="cmt_word">He hath blessed thy children within thee.</span> Under Nehemiah's govern-meet, when he had firmly established it, Israel enjoyed a period of repose and of great prosperity, which, at the date of the psalm, was probably just commencing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/147.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>147:12-20 The church, like Jerusalem of old, built up and preserved by the wisdom, power, and goodness of God, is exhorted to praise him for all the benefits and blessings vouchsafed to her; and these are represented by his favours in the course of nature. The thawing word may represent the gospel of Christ, and the thawing wind the Spirit of Christ; for the Spirit is compared to the wind, Joh 3:8. Converting grace softens the heart that was hard frozen, and melts it into tears of repentance, and makes good reflections to flow, which before were chilled and stopped up. The change which the thaw makes is very evident, yet how it is done no one can say. Such is the change wrought in the conversion of a soul, when God's word and Spirit are sent to melt it and restore it to itself.</body></html>
