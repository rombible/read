The rebuilding of Jerusalem after the return from the Babylonish captivity covered a space of above ninety years, from <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> till <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>. First the temple was built (B.C. 533-515); then the city; finally, the walls and the gates ( <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>). It was in connection with this last portion of the building that the present psalm seems to have been written. <span class="cmt_word">He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.</span> The exiles returned gradually - some with Zerubbabel ( <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>); some with Ezra, in <span class="date">B.C. 457</span>; others, doubtless, with Nehemiah, in <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>; and again in <span class="date">B.C. 434</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/147.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>147:1-11 Praising God is work that is its own wages. It is comely; it becomes us as reasonable creatures, much more as people in covenant with God. He gathers outcast sinners by his grace, and will bring them into his holy habitation. To those whom God heals with the consolations of his Spirit, he speaks peace, assures them their sins are pardoned. And for this, let others praise him also. Man's knowledge is soon ended; but God's knowledge is a dept that can never be fathomed. And while he telleth the number of the stars, he condescends to hear the broken-hearted sinner. While he feeds the young ravens, he will not leave his praying people destitute. Clouds look dull and melancholy, yet without them we could have no rain, therefore no fruit. Thus afflictions look black and unpleasant; but from clouds of affliction come showers that make the soul to yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness. The psalmist delights not in things wherein sinners trust and glory; but a serious and suitable regard to God is, in his sight, of very great price. We are not to be in doubt between hope and fear, but to act under the gracious influences of hope and fear united.</body></html>
