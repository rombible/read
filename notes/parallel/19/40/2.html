Some imagine a pit with rushing water at the bottom of it, but such pits are scarcely known in Palestine. Others a pit which is filled with noise as a warrior, with crash of arms and amid the shouts of enemies, falls into it. But pits, though used in hunting, were not employed in warfare. The explanation that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> here is to be taken in the secondary sense of "destruction" or "misery," seems to me preferable (see the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of the miry</span> <span class="cmt_word">clay</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2, 14</a>).

There is power enough in God to help the weakest, and grace enough to help the unworthiest of all that trust in him. The psalmist waited patiently; he continued believing, hoping, and praying. This is applicable to Christ. His agony, in the garden and on the cross, was a horrible pit and miry clay. But those that wait patiently for God do not wait in vain. Those that have been under religious melancholy, and by the grace of God have been relieved, may apply ver. 2 very feelingly to themselves; they are brought up out of a horrible pit. Christ is the Rock on which a poor soul can alone stand fast. Where God has given stedfast hope, he expects there should be a steady, regular walk and conduct. God filled the psalmist with joy, as well as peace in believing. Multitudes, by faith beholding the sufferings and glory of Christ, have learned to fear the justice and trust in the mercy of God through Him. Many are the benefits with which we are daily loaded, both by the providence and by the grace of God.</body></html>
