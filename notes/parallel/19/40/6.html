The words are an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm" title="And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.">1Samuel 15:22</a>. The attentive ear and obedient heart, not formal rites, constitute true worship. Comp. the words so frequent on the lips of Christ, "He that hath ears to hear let him hear." The fact that the plural <span class= "ital">ears </span>is used instead of the singular, sets aside the idea of <span class= "ital">a revelation, </span>which is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm" title="Yes, you heard not; yes, you knew not; yes, from that time that your ear was not opened: for I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.">Isaiah 48:8</a> by "open the <span class= "ital">ear" </span>and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-15.htm" title="Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,">1Samuel 9:15</a> "uncover the <span class= "ital">ear." </span>Not that the idea is altogether excluded, since the outward ears maybe typical of the inward. The same fact excludes allusion to the symbolic act by which a slave was devoted to perpetual servitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm" title="Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.">Exodus 21:6</a>), because then also only <span class= "ital">one ear </span>was bored. For the well-known variation in the LXX. see <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>.

Will the right return be by sacrifices and burnt offerings? No, the psalmist answers to himself; it is not these which God really "desires." Samuel had already preached the doctrine, "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). David goes further. Apart from a spirit of obedience, sacrifice and offering are not desired or required at all; rather, as Isaiah says, they are a weariness and an abomination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11, 12</a>). The one thing needed is obedience - a cheerful, willing obedience to all that God reveals as his will. <span class="cmt_word">Mine ears hast thou opened</span>. Either, "Thou hast taken away my deafness, and given me ears open to receive and embrace thy Law;" or, perhaps, with special reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-17.htm">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>, "Thou hast accepted me as thy voluntary servant, and bored through mine ear, to mark that I am thy servant for ever." <span class="cmt_word">Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required</span>. Of the four kinds of offering mentioned in this verse, the first (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d1;&#x5d7;</span>) is the ordinary offering of a victim at the altar in sacrifice; the second (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span>), the meat offering of flour, with oil and frankincense accompanying it; the third (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>) is the "whole burnt offering," representative of complete self-sacrifice; and the fourth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d8;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>), the "sin offering," or "trespass offering," of which the special intention was expiation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:6-10 The psalmist foretells that work of wonder, redemption by our Lord Jesus Christ. The Substance must come, which is Christ, who must bring that glory to God, and that grace to man, which it was impossible the sacrifices should ever do. Observe the setting apart of our Lord Jesus to the work and office of Mediator. In the volume, or roll, of the book it was written of him. In the close rolls of the Divine decrees and counsel, the covenant of redemption was recorded. Also, in all the volumes of the Old Testament something was written of him, Joh 19:28. Now the purchase of our salvation is made, the proclamation is sent forth, calling us to come and accept it. It was preached freely and openly. Whoever undertook to preach the gospel of Christ, would be under great temptation to conceal it; but Christ, and those he calls to that work, are carried on in it. May we believe his testimony, trust his promise, and submit to his authority.</body></html>
