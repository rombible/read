The exact nature of the "evils" is not mentioned; but the worst of them appears to be "the deep and bitter consciousness of sin" revealed in the next clause. Another was, beyond all doubt, the continued animosity of enemies (ver. 14). Mental and bodily weakness may have been added, and have completed the crushing load whereof complaint is made. It is noted that the exceedingly deep consciousness of sin here displayed "belongs altogether to a late part of David's life" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not</span> <span class="cmt_word">able to look up;</span> rather, <span class="accented">so that</span> 1 <span class="accented">am not able to see.</span> An actual failure of sight seems to be intended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a>; 28:10). <span class="cmt_word">They are more than the hairs</span> <span class="cmt_word">of my head;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are more in number. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore my heart faileth me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my courage" and "my strength of mind" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-10.htm">Psalm 38:10</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/40.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>40:11-17 The best saints see themselves undone, unless continually preserved by the grace of God. But see the frightful view the psalmist had of sin. This made the discovery of a Redeemer so welcome. In all his reflections upon each step of his life, he discovered something amiss. The sight and sense of our sins in their own colours, must distract us, if we have not at the same time some sight of a Saviour. If Christ has triumphed over our spiritual enemies, then we, through him, shall be more than conquerors. This may encourage all that seek God and love his salvation, to rejoice in him, and to praise him. No griefs nor poverty can render those miserable who fear the Lord. Their God, and all that he has or does, is the ground of their joy. The prayer of faith can unlock his fulness, which is adapted to all their wants. The promises are sure, the moment of fulfilment hastens forward. He who once came in great humility, shall come again in glorious majesty.</body></html>
