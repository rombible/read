His heart is full of things to write, but he hopes soon to have unlimited conversation.<p><span class= "bld">Paper.</span>--The Egyptian <span class= "ital">papyrus.</span><p><span class= "bld">Ink.</span>--A mixture of soot, water, and gum. The papyrus-tree grows in the swamps of the Nile to the height of ten feet and more. Paper was prepared from the thin coats that surround the plant. Pliny describes the method (xiii. 23). The different pieces were joined together by the turbid Nile water, as it has a kind of glutinous property. One layer of papyrus was laid flat on a board, and a cross layer put over it; these were pressed, and afterwards dried in the sun. The sheets were then fastened or pasted together. There were never more than twenty of these sheets fastened together in a roll; but of course the length could be increased to any extent. The writing was in columns, with a blank slip between them; it was only on one side. When the work was finished, it was rolled on a staff, and sometimes wrapped in a parchment case (Smith, <span class= "ital">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, </span>p. 567).<p>Of the ink used by the Romans, Pliny says that it was made of soot in various ways, with burnt resin or pitch. "For this purpose they have built furnaces which do not allow the smoke to escape. The kind most commended is made in this way from pine-wood: it is mixed with soot from the furnaces or baths; and this they use for writing on rolls. Some also make a kind of ink by boiling and straining the lees of wine." The black matter of the cuttle-fish was also sometimes used for writing (Smith, <span class= "ital">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</span>, p. 110).<p>The pen was a reed, sharpened with a knife, and split like a quill-pen.<p>The Jews seem to have used lamp-black dissolved in gall-juice, or lamp-black and vitriol, for ink. The modern scribes "have an apparatus consisting of a metal or ebony tube for their reed-pens, with a cup or bulb of the same material attached to the upper end for ink. This they thrust through the girdle, and carry with them at all times" (Thomson, <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book, </span>p. 131; Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible, </span>p. 1802).<p><span class= "bld">Speak face to face.</span>--Not that there was any oral tradition which he would not write down. His Gospel and First Epistle would contain the outline of all his teaching. But on this occasion there was no need for writing.

It would be the deep satisfaction of the interchange of spiritual thoughts and aspirations without the limitations of a monologue or of writing materials.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">The children of thy elect sister.</span>--He may have been staying at this second matron's house; at any rate, the family knew he was writing. The simplicity of the great Apostle, the personal friend of the risen Lord, the last of the great pillars of the Church of Christ--in transmitting this familiar message, makes a most instructive finish to what is throughout a beautiful picture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - 3. THE CONCLUSION OF THE EPISTLE. It is in their openings and conclusions, and especially in the latter, that the Second and Third Epistles have so strong a resemblance that we are almost compelled to assign them not merely to the same author, but to the same period in the author's life. St. John had a tenacious memory, as his writings prove; but we may doubt whether so trivial a matter as the mode of beginning and ending a short letter would have remained for years together in his mind. We may reasonably conclude from their similarity that these two Epistles are separated from one another by only a short interval of time. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having many things to write.</span> This remark is almost conclusive against the supposition that the Second Epistle was sent as a companion-letter to the First. The hypothesis has little or nothing to support it. I would not (do so) by means of paper and ink. It is astonishing that any one should suppose that intercourse on paper is here opposed to <span class="accented">spiritual</span> intercourse: obviously it is opposed to <span class="accented">conversation.</span> The elder just writes what is of urgent importance to prevent fatal mistakes during the present time, and leaves everything else until he can talk matters over with her. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is mentioned nowhere else in the New Testament, but is found in the Septuagint (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>); it probably means "papyrus." <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-13.htm">3 John 1:13</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>; it was commonly made of lampblack or other soot, and hence the name. <span class="cmt_word">But I hope to come unto you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I hope to come to be</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">at your house.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> is here very much the same as the French <span class="accented">chez vous.</span> So also <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-56.htm">Matthew 13:56</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13</a>).

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; but there the emphatic thing is that the two should <span class="accented">see</span> one another. Here the special point is that they should <span class="accented">converse</span> with one another; and this is more clearly expressed by "month to mouth" than by "face to face." For the phrase, "that <span class="accented">your</span> joy may be fulfilled," see note on 1 John 1:4, to which passage the apostle may here be consciously referring. That was ever one main purpose of his teaching - the perfecting of Christian joy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:12,13 The apostle refers many things to a personal meeting. Pen and ink were means of strengthening and comforting others; but to see each other is more so. The communion of saints should be maintained by all methods; and should tend to mutual joy. In communion with them we find much of our present joy, and look forward to happiness for ever.</body></html>
