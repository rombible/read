Having congratulated her about this, he states the chief thing which he desires of her: the pure Christian love which implies every other grace and virtue; in other words, walking after the divine commandments. That this love should be pure, that these commandments should be unimpaired, it was necessary to remember that nothing new could be added to the original message of Christ. This warning was timely, because many errors had already appeared, especially that greatest error which denied the Incarnation. The family must, therefore, be on its guard, lest it should be cheated of its reward. The test was very simple: any advance beyond the doctrine of Christ. It would be better for the family not to entertain in their house any who had committed themselves to these doctrines of development (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2John 1:4-11</a>).<p>(2 <span class= "ital">a.</span>) (4) <span class= "bld">I rejoiced . . .</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;">1Corinthians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Philippians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Of thy children.</span>--Probably those met at home.<p><span class= "bld">Walking in truth.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1John 1:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/3_john/1-3.htm" title="For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.">3John 1:3-4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As we have received a commandment</span>.--That is, walking according to the revelation of God's will in Christ Jesus.<p>(2 <span class= "ital">b.</span>) (5) Love is the Christian's moral disposition of mind, which embraces all other virtues and graces. It implies faith, because it is founded on Christian principle, and can only be tested by a right belief. It implies purity, because it is modelled on the love of God, and has abjured the old man. It implies unselfishness, because it desires the good of the other for his own sake and God's. It implies humility, because it distrusts itself, relies on God, and thinks more of the other than of itself.

It might have been thought that love would be a vague immeasurable feeling, differing chiefly in intensity; but the Christian disposition which is described as love is that practical and enlightened result of faith which naturally acts and expresses itself by following God's will in all things.

He is not speaking of those who had never heard or been instructed in the doctrine of Christ; they would be less dangerous. He means those who deliberately altered the Apostolic teaching. And his reason is evidently chiefly the religious welfare of the matron and her family. The case supplies an important instruction in the theory of Christian social conduct.<p><span class= "bld">Receive him not into your house, neither</span> <span class= "bld">bid him God speed.</span>--These are no terms of ordinary politeness, which the Apostle does not forbid, but terms of close Christian intimacy and spiritual communion, the deliberate cultivation of personal acquaintance, fraternal intercourse. The highest sort of Christian brotherly love--love, that is, in its fulness and truth--can only find reciprocity in the same atmosphere of Christ, on the same basis, and in the same characteristics. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2Corinthians 6:16</a>.)<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Is partaker of his evil deeds.</span>--Condones his false doctrine; puts himself in a position to accept it; shares the guilt of his disloyalty by sympathising with him; and in this way lowers his whole moral standard, doing an injury to "God, Christ, the Church, the truth, individual communities, and his own soul." If any interpret the exhortations to love in the Epistles of St. John too liberally, or by too low a measure, this passage is a wholesome corrective. In applying this teaching to modern times we should remember (1) that St. John is only speaking of those who deliberately deprave the doctrine of Christ in its great outlines; (2) that there may be much in ourselves, in our systems, in our quarrels, in our incrustations of divine truth, in our want of the sense of proportion in dealing with divine things, which may have hindered others from receiving Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I rejoice greatly that I have found (certain) of thy children walking in truth.</span> The Revised Version is certainly right in rendering <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f55;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> "I <span class="accented">have</span> found" rather than "I found;" and it is probably right in rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> "I rejoice" rather than "I rejoiced." It looks like the idiomatic "epistolary aorist," of which we have had probable instances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-21.htm">1 John 2:21</a> and 26. In this idiom the point of view of the <span class="accented">recipient</span> of the letter is taken instead of that of the writer. In Latin the imperfect is used in a similar way - <span class="accented">scribebam, dabamus</span>; and sometimes the perfect, <span class="accented">scripsi, misi</span>, and the like (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-30.htm">Acts 23:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-11.htm">Philemon 1:11, 19, 21</a>. See Moulton's Winer, page 347). We are probably to understand this verse as a gentle intimation on the part of the elder that he has reason to know that certain others of her children are <span class="accented">not</span> walking in truth. Through the elect lady's too indiscriminate hospitality, some of her children have been seduced by the deceivers who have come to her bringing other doctrine than that of Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:4-6 It is good to be trained to early religion; and children may be beloved for their parents' sake. It gave great joy to the apostle to see children treading in their parents' steps, and likely in their turn to support the gospel. May God bless such families more and more, and raise up many to copy their example. How pleasing the contrast to numbers who spread irreligion, infidelity, and vice, among their children! Our walk is true, our converse right, when according to the word of God. This commandment of mutual Christian love, may be said to be a new one, in respect of its being declared by the Lord Christ; yet, as to the matter, it is old. And this is love to our own souls, that we obey the Divine commands. The foresight of the decay of this love, as well as of other apostacies, or fallings away, might engage the apostle to urge this duty, and this command, frequently and earnestly.</body></html>
