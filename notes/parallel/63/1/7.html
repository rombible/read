The dangers which they suggest are not imaginary. Mischief has already been done by neglecting them. "Deceiver" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here means "seducer," one who causes others to go astray. The cognate verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span> is frequent in St. John, especially in the Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3, 8, 10</a>), and commonly indicates seduction into grave error (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). The true reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> gives "are gone forth," not "are entered" <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. We cannot be sure that "are gone forth" refers to their leaving the true Church; although <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a> inclines us to think so: it may mean no more than that they have gone abroad spreading their erroneous tenets. Just as "love not" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10, 14, 15</a> and 1 John 4:20 is equivalent to "hate," so "confess not" here is equivalent to "deny." These seducers deny "Jesus Christ <span class="accented">as coming</span> in the flesh," or (as the Greek may possibly mean) they deny "Jesus <span class="accented">as Christ coming</span> in the flesh." The present participle <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> seems to indicate exactly the position of some of the Gnostic teachers. The Jew denied that the Incarnation <span class="accented">had</span> taken place - the Messiah had not yet come. The Gnostic denied that the Incarnation <span class="accented">could</span> take place: no such Person as the Christ coming in the flesh was possible; that the Infinite should become finite, that the Divine Word should become flesh, was inconceivable. The teacher who brings such doctrine as this "is <span class="accented">the</span> deceiver and <span class="accented">the</span> antichrist" about whom the elder's children had been so frequently warned. In the strong language which St. John here and elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>) uses respecting those who deny or pervert the truth, we hear the voice of the "son of thunder," ever jealous about whatever touched the honour of his Lord. Such hatred of error was the outcome of a firm grasp, and profound love, of the truth. It is easy to imitate and to exceed such strength of language; but let us beware of doing so without having first attained to an equal comprehension of the truth, and an equal affection for it. The strong words of the apostle are the expression of a glowing conviction. Our strong words are too often the expression of a heated temper; and a man who loses his temper in argument cares more about himself than about the truth. Let us remember the noble words of St. Augustine to the heretics of his own day: "Let those rage against you who know not with what toil truth is found, and how difficult it is to avoid errors; who know not with how much difficulty the eye of the inner man is made whole; who know not with what sighs and groans it is made possible, in however small a degree, to comprehend God." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:7-11 The deceiver and his deceit are described: he brings some error concerning the person or office of the Lord Jesus. Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist; he deludes souls, and undermines the glory and kingdom of the Lord Christ. Let us not think it strange, that there are deceivers and opposers of the Lord Christ's name and dignity now, for there were such, even in the apostles' times. The more deceivers and deceits abound, the more watchful the disciples must be. Sad it is, that splendid attainments in the school of Christ, should ever be lost. The way to gain the full reward is, to abide true to Christ, and constant in religion to the end. Firm cleaving to Christian truth unites us to Christ, and thereby to the Father also; for they are one. Let us equally disregard such as abide not in the doctrine of Christ, and those who transgress his commands. Any who did not profess and preach the doctrine of Christ, respecting him as the Son of God, and salvation by him from guilt and sin, were not to be noticed and countenanced. Yet in obeying this command, we must show kindness and a good spirit to those who differ from us in lesser matters, but hold firmly the all-important doctrines of Christ's person, atonement, and holy salvation.</body></html>
