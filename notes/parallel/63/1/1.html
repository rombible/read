Her sister's children are in the same place as the writer. The two mothers are both honoured with the religious title "elect." The writer (we assume from the introduction that he is the Apostle John) loves the family with true Christian love. All who are in the way of truth have the same feelings for them, for the truth is a bond of union between all such.

The Greek word, however, for "lady," (<span class= "ital">Kuria, </span>or <span class= "ital">Kyria</span>) was a proper name; so that those who think that St. John addresses "the elect Kyria" are at liberty to do so. The absence of the article would not be more surprising in that case than it would be if we translate "lady," for "elect" would evidently be in such familiar use that the article would be easily omitted.<p>If the name of the matron is not given, it is not absurd to suppose that the dangers of the times, or family persecution, may have made it advisable that both her name and that of the writer should be withheld. The messenger would supply both deficiencies.<p>The term "lady" would not imply anything about her social station.

Other apostles had been called elders; their successors also were called elders; but St. John was "the elder." That there was a second John at Ephesus, who was known as "the elder," to distinguish him from the apostle and evangelist, is a theory of Eusebius, based upon a doubtful interpretation of an awkwardly worded passage in Papias. But it is by no means certain that any such person ever existed. Irenaeus, who had read Papias, and been intimate with Polycarp, the disciple of St. John, seems to know nothing of any such person. Even if he existed, there is little reason for attributing this Epistle to him; it is too like the First Epistle to be by a different author. Unto the elect lady. This rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> should be retained: <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span> <span class="accented">cannot be a</span> proper name, on account of verse 13; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> need not be one. We commit ourselves to nothing that is disputable if we render <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> "lady;" whereas if we render it "Kyria" it is open to any one to object that perhaps the lady's name was not Kyria, and that perhaps she is not an individual at all, but a Church. She is elect, as being chosen out of the dominion of the evil one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>) into the Christian family. She is thus reminded at the outset of the relationship between them; she is a member of that elect company of believers of which he is the elder. It is futile to ask who this lady is. There have been various conjectures, some of them absurd; but we know no more than the letter itself tells us. Evidently the lady and her children were not among the great ones of the earth; they have made no name in the world. And herein lies one of the chief lessons of the Epistle. Those mentioned in it were ordinary people, such as any Church in any generation might produce. But because they were faithful, and endeavoured to live up to their calling, the apostle loved them, and all true Christians loved them, and he dared to assure them that "grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father" should be their portion. Any Christian minister may give the same assurance to faithful Christians, however humble and inconspicuous, still. They may win no place in the history of the world that is passing away; but they have a place in the heart of him who abideth for ever. Note the characteristic repetition of the characteristic word "truth," which occurs five times in the first four verses. All words respecting truth and bearing witness to it are characteristic of St. John. In two of the five cases "truth" has the article; "all they that know <span class="accented">the</span> truth; for <span class="accented">the</span> truth's sake which abideth in us." It is not impossible that "the truth" here means him who is the Way, the Truth and the Life. Christ is the Revelation of Divine truth to man. All who know him love all faithful Christians for his sake. To the apostle truth was not a mere notion, "or a set of notions, however large and accurate; it was no theory about God, but God himself, and God manifest in the flesh in order that we might know him and partake his life." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 Religion turns compliments into real expressions of respect and love. And old disciple is honourable; an old apostle and leader of disciples is more so. The letter is to a noble Christian matron, and her children; it is well that the gospel should get among such: some noble persons are called. Families are to be encouraged and directed in their love and duties at home. Those who love truth and piety in themselves, should love it in others; and the Christians loved this lady, not for her rank, but for her holiness. And where religion truly dwells, it will abide for ever. From the Divine Persons of the Godhead, the apostle craves grace, Divine favour, and good-will, the spring of all good things. It is grace indeed that any spiritual blessing should be given to sinful mortals. Mercy, free pardon, and forgiveness; for those already rich in grace, need continual forgiveness. Peace, quietness of spirit, and a clear conscience, in assured reconciliation with God, together with all outward prosperity that is really for good: these are desired in truth and love.</body></html>
