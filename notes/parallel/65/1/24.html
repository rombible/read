It would be rash to infer from the similarity that St. Jude must have known the Epistle to the Romans; although there is nothing incredible in the supposition that he was acquainted with it. The Epistle had been in circulation probably for some ten years before St. Jude wrote. Doxologies no doubt became elastic formulas almost from the first.<p><span class= "bld">To keep you from falling.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to keep you unfallen.</span> From his own warnings, denunciations, and exhortations, which have been severe and sombre throughout, St. Jude turns in joyous, exulting confidence to Him who alone can make them effectual. "Keep you," or, <span class= "ital">guard you:</span> not the more general word translated "preserved" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm" title2="Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:">Jude 1:1</a>, but another more in harmony with the present context, as indicating <span class= "ital">protection</span> against the great perils just pointed out. A reading of much authority has "them" for "you"--<span class= "ital">to keep them unfallen.</span> If it be correct, it may be explained as being in thought, though not in form, addressed to God, so that those to whom he is writing are spoken of in the third person.<p><span class= "bld">Before the presence of his glory.</span>--The glory that shall be revealed at the day of judgment. The meaning is, "Who can bring it to pass that you stand blameless before the judgment-seat" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title2=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title2="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1Thessalonians 3:13</a>).<p>(25) <span class= "bld">To the only wise God our Saviour.</span>--The coupling of "Saviour" with "God" is common in the Pastoral Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm" title2="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;">1Timothy 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-3.htm" title2="For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;">1Timothy 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-3.htm" title2="But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;">Titus 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm" title2="Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.">Titus 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-4.htm" title2="But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,">Titus 3:4</a>). "Wise" must be omitted as wanting in authority. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-27.htm" title2="To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.">Romans 16:27</a>.) Doxologies became well-known forms with many variations: changes to something more familiar to the copyist might easily be made in transcribing.<p>After "Saviour" must be inserted, on the highest MS. authority, "through Jesus Christ our Lord." Wiclif and the Rhemish have the missing clause.<p><span class= "bld">Glory and majesty, dominion and power.</span> Omit the first "and." "Glory" and "dominion" are frequent in the New Testament doxologies: the Greek words represented by "majesty" and "power" occur here only. After "power" we must supply, on overwhelming authority, "before all time." Consequently "is" may be substituted for "be" before "glory;" but no verb is needed.<p><span class= "bld">Both now and ever.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and now and to all the ages;</span> so that the whole will run thus: <span class= "ital">To the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, and now, and to all the ages.</span> Thus we have a most comprehensive phrase for eternity--before time, time, after time--and thus the three-fold arrangement runs through to the very end.<p><span class= "bld">Amen.</span>--Common ending of a doxology.

These ungodly men may "despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities," may utter "great swelling words" about their own knowledge and liberty, and scoff at those who walk not with them; but still, ages before they were born, and ages after they have ceased to be, glory, majesty, dominion, and power belong to Him who saves us, and would save even them, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - The Epistle closes with a doxology of a high and solemn strain, resembling in some respects that with which the Epistle to the Romans concludes, and couched in terms befitting what has just been said of danger and duty. <span class="cmt_word">Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling.</span> The writer has counseled the readers to keep themselves in the love of God. He has also set before them the attitude they ought to adopt toward different classes, and has not concealed the peril to themselves which the discharge of Christian duty to others may involve. Recognizing how short the way is that brotherly counsel or personal effort can carry one in these solemn and arduous obligations, he now reminds his readers of a higher power that is available for their help and protection, and commends them to that as their best, their only security. The risk of <span class="accented">falling</span> or <span class="accented">stumbling</span>, as it rather means, is great. Only the omnipotence of God can "keep" them from it or <span class="accented">protect</span> them against it, the word for "keeping" being one which expresses the idea of "guarding." <span class="cmt_word">And to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.</span> The terms here again arc exceedingly vivid, the one which is rendered "present" meaning to "set one up" or "make one stand," and the "faultless" being the adjective "without blemish" which is applied to the Levitical offerings in the Old Testament, and to Christ himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>. The "glory" here in view is that of the last day, when he to whom all judgment is committed returns to execute that judgment in his own glory and that of his Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>). The "exceeding joy" expresses the feeling with which it shall be given to the faithful to meet that day. The Revised Version, therefore, more correctly renders it, "And to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy." Weak and vulnerable as they are, God's grace is mighty to do these two things for them - to protect them through time, and at the end of time to make them stand the scrutiny of the Judge like men in whom no blemish is discovered, and to whom that day brings exultant joy. <span class="cmt_word">To the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore</span> (or, <span class="accented">unto all the ages</span>). So the Revised Version renders it, in accordance with the best-authenticated text. Documentary evidence renders it necessary to omit the "wise" in the "only wise God" of the Authorized Version, to insert the clause, "through our Lord Jesus Christ," to omit the "and" before the "majesty," and to adopt the extended expression of duration in the closing sentence. Thus the largest possible ascription of praise is made to God. It is the ascription of an honour which is confessed to belong to him eternally, before the world was, as well as in the present, and on to the eternity which is yet to enter. This is his in his character of <span class="accented">Saviour</span> - Preserver of them that are tending to fall, Redeemer of the weak and sinful; and, therefore, it is "through Jesus Christ." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:24,25 God is able, and as willing as able, to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless before the presence of his glory. Not as those who never have been faulty, but as those who, but for God's mercy, and a Saviour's sufferings and merits, might most justly have been condemned long ago. All sincere believers were given him of the Father; and of all so given him he has lost none, nor will lose any one. Now, our faults fill us with fears, doubts, and sorrows; but the Redeemer has undertaken for his people, that they shall be presented faultless. Where there is no sin, there will be no sorrow; where there is the perfection of holiness, there will be the perfection of joy. Let us more often look up to Him who is able to keep us from falling, to improve as well as maintain the work he has wrought in us, till we shall be presented blameless before the presence of his glory. Then shall our hearts know a joy beyond what earth can afford; then shall God also rejoice over us, and the joy of our compassionate Saviour be completed. To Him who has so wisely formed the scheme, and will faithfully and perfectly accomplish it, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and for ever. Amen.</body></html>
