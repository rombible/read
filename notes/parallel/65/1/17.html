Its object is to save them from being disconcerted by the rise of these impious men or beguiled by their pretensions. They are reminded, therefore, of apostolic words, by which from the beginning they had been taught to anticipate such perils and to be on their guard against them. <span class="cmt_word">But, beloved, remember ye the words which were</span> (or, <span class="accented">have been</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>spoken before of</span> (i.e. <span class="accented">by</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The Revised Version rightly restores the rendering "but <span class="accented">ye</span>, beloved," which the Authorized Version dropped. The older versions, Wickliffe, Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan, the Rhemish, agree in introducing this emphatic "ye," which sets the readers in sharpest contrast to these "murmurers," and gives greater point to Jude's appeal. The teaching of the apostles on the subject in hand is referred to as something by no means strange to them. The terms would naturally suggest that the readers had been themselves hearers of the apostles. They are not decisive, however, of the question whether oral or written communications, direct or indirect instructions, are in view. The indeterminate sense of the term "apostle," and the general tenor of the reference, make it impossible to say that Jude ranks himself here among the twelve. The sentence would be more natural on the lips of one who was not himself an apostle. <span class="cmt_word">How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</span> The Revised Version is more literally true to the original in giving this the direct form, <span class="accented">how that they said, to you, In the last time there shall be mockers</span>, etc. This does not necessarily imply, however, that written words are referred to, or that a quotation is being made. The tense of the verb, "said," by which the words are introduced, points the other way. It means that they were <span class="accented">in the way of saying</span> such things, and makes it probable, therefore, that Jude refers to the substance of what the apostles were in the habit of saying about the future in their ordinary preaching and teaching. Christ's own prophecies on the subject of the end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24, 25</a>) would form the text for such declarations. We have examples of these apostolic predictions in the case of Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>), in that of John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>), in that of Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-2.htm">2 Peter 3:2, 3</a>). The last resembles the present passage most closely, the same unusual word for "mockers," or "scoffers," being common to both. The stress of the statement is again on the sensual impiety of these men, as appears from the strong and peculiar phrase with which the prediction closes, "walking after their own lusts of ungodliness" (Revised Version, margin). By "the last time" (with which compare the expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>, etc.) is meant the time which closes the present order of things, and ushers in Christ's return. It was a Hebrew idea that time was divided into two great periods - " this age" and "the age to come," which were parted by the coming of Messiah. The "age to come," or the Messianic age, was in principle introduced by Messiah's first advent, but it was to be finally brought in by his second advent - an event conceived to be near. The time which heralded the conclusive termination of the one period and entrance of the other was "the last time" - a time of evils and of portents marking the end of the old order. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-23 Sensual men separate from Christ, and his church, and join themselves to the devil, the world, and the flesh, by ungodly and sinful practices. That is infinitely worse than to separate from any branch of the visible church on account of opinions, or modes and circumstances of outward government or worship. Sensual men have not the spirit of holiness, which whoever has not, does not belong to Christ. The grace of faith is most holy, as it works by love, purifies the heart, and overcomes the world, by which it is distinguished from a false and dead faith. Our prayers are most likely to prevail, when we pray in the Holy Ghost, under his guidance and influence, according to the rule of his word, with faith, fervency, and earnestness; this is praying in the Holy Ghost. And a believing expectation of eternal life will arm us against the snares of sin: lively faith in this blessed hope will help us to mortify our lusts. We must watch over one another; faithfully, yet prudently reprove each other, and set a good example to all about us. This must be done with compassion, making a difference between the weak and the wilful. Some we must treat with tenderness. Others save with fear; urging the terrors of the Lord. All endeavours must be joined with decided abhorrence of crimes, and care be taken to avoid whatever led to, or was connected with fellowship with them, in works of darkness, keeping far from what is, or appears to be evil.</body></html>
