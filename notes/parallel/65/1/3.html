The "at once" comes from the tense, which is present in the first clause, aorist in the second.

"Crept in unawares" is analogous to "unawares brought in, who came in privily" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm" title2="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a>, where see Note), and to "privily bring in (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title2="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>). It is this insidious invasion which constitutes the necessity for writing stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm" title2="Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you, and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.">Jude 1:3</a>.

The text is a favourite one with Calvinists; but it gives no countenance to extreme predestination views. "Of old" cannot refer to the eternal purposes of God, but to something in history. On the other hand, it is doubtful whether it can refer to the recent warnings of St. Paul and St. Peter that false teachers should arise: otherwise one would be tempted to refer it to 2 Peter 2 Something more remote from the writer's own day seems to be required: either the Old Testament prophets, or the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch, </span>quoted below. The Greek word here rendered "before ordained" is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm" title2="For whatever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.">Romans 15:4</a> rendered "written aforetime."

"<span class= "ital">Our</span> God," not theirs; they are "without God in the world."

The Greek word expresses license generally, not merely sins of impurity.<p><span class= "bld">Denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">denying the only Master, and our Lord Jesus Christ. "</span>God" is an addition to the original text, and must be omitted. "Lord" represents two words in the Greek quite different one from the other. The Genevan version is right all but the insertion of "God;" the Rhemish quite right--having "Dominator," however, for "Master." We are once more in doubt whether one or two Persons of the Trinity are mentioned here. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title2="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>.) Certainly <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title2="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a> countenances our taking "the only Master" as meaning Christ; and the fact that the article is not repeated with "Lord" is in favour of only one Person being meant. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-29.htm" title2="Lord, now let you your servant depart in peace, according to your word:">Luke 2:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-24.htm" title2="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:">Acts 4:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm" title2="And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?">Revelation 6:10</a> countenance our understanding these words as meaning the Father; and the absence of the article before "Lord" is not conclusive. The insertion of "God" is, perhaps, a gloss to insist on this latter interpretation. If it be right, the clause is closely parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm" title2="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son.">1John 2:22</a> : "He is Antichrist that <span class= "ital">denieth the Father and the Son.</span>" Note the emphatic insertion of "our" once more: they will not have Him for <span class= "ital">their</span> Lord; His divine authority was precisely what they denied.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">author's reason for writing.</span> The statement of this is introduced by the conciliatory address, beloved - a form of address found twice again in this short Epistle (verses 17, 20). It occurs at great turning-points in all the Catholic Epistles, except for an obvious reason in 2 John. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-16.htm">James 1:16, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a> (who couples the term "brethren" with it); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1, 8, 14, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1, 7, 11</a> 3John 2, 5, 11.) It is frequent also in the Pauline Epistles. It is only here, however, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1.htm">3 John 1:2</a> that it is introduced so near the beginning of an Epistle. The statement itself contains several expressions which demand notice. The phrase which the Authorized Version renders, <span class="cmt_word">When I gave all diligence,</span> is better rendered, <span class="accented">while I was giving all diligence</span>, with the Revised Version. In this particular form it occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; but it has close parallels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11</a>. The noun is the same as is translated "diligence" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>, and "business" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>. It is not certain whether the phrase expresses action here as well as earnest desire; but it indicates the position of the author, whether as seriously bethinking himself to write, or actually engaged in the task, when he had occasion to send the counsels given in this Epistle. The subject on which he had thought of addressing them was the <span class="cmt_word">common salvation</span> - the term "salvation" meaning here neither the <span class="accented">doctrine</span> nor the <span class="accented">means</span> of redemption, but the grace of redemption itself. And this grace is designated "common," or, as the better reading gives it, "our common salvation;" not with reference to any contrast of Jew with Gentile, but simply as a grace open to all, and in which writer and readers had an equal interest (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>; and especially the "common faith" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>). The "like precious faith' of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a> is a stronger expression, and probably points to a distinction, formerly existent, but now removed, between Jew and Gentile. The next phrase is rendered too weakly by the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">It was needful for me to write unto you.</span> Neither does the Revised Version quite bring out the idea when it substitutes, <span class="accented">I was constrained to write unto you.</span> What is in view is an objective necessity; certain circumstances which had arisen and imperatively demanded writing. So that we might translate it, "necessity arose for me to write," or, "an emergency occurred constraining me to write." He was thus induced to write in the way of <span class="accented">exhorting</span> them. The particular subject of the exhortation is described as the duty of <span class="cmt_word">contending earnestly for the faith;</span> the contention being expressed by a strong term somewhat analogous to that used by Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, and the "faith" being taken, not in the subjective sense of the quality or grace of belief, but in the objective sense of the things believed. This "faith" is declared to have been <span class="cmt_word">delivered once for all</span> (so, with the Revised Version; not <span class="accented">once delivered</span>, as the Authorized Version puts it, which might mean "once on a time") <span class="cmt_word">to the saints.</span> It is not stated <span class="accented">by whom</span> the deliverance was made. The unexpressed subject may be God, as some suppose who point to the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a> and 1 Cor 15:3; or it may be the apostles, as others hold who look to the analogy of such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-21.htm">2 Peter 2:21</a>, and especially the seventeenth verse of the present Epistle itself. The main point is, not the author or the instruments of the deliverance, but the fact that such a deliverance has taken place. What has been transmitted is carefully defined, not, indeed, as a system of doctrine, but at least as a sum or deposit of things necessary to be believed. This is said to have been given once for all, so that there is no repetition or extension of the gift. It is described; further, as committed, not to the Church as an organization, nor to any particular office-bearers, but to the saints in general. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Christians are called out of the world, from the evil spirit and temper of it; called above the world, to higher and better things, to heaven, things unseen and eternal; called from sin to Christ, from vanity to seriousness, from uncleanness to holiness; and this according to the Divine purpose and grace. If sanctified and glorified, all the honour and glory must be ascribed to God, and to him alone. As it is God who begins the work of grace in the souls of men, so it is he who carries it on, and perfects it. Let us not trust in ourselves, nor in our stock of grace already received, but in him, and in him alone. The mercy of God is the spring and fountain of all the good we have or hope for; mercy, not only to the miserable, but to the guilty. Next to mercy is peace, which we have from the sense of having obtained mercy. From peace springs love; Christ's love to us, our love to him, and our brotherly love to one another. The apostle prays, not that Christians may be content with a little; but that their souls and societies may be full of these things. None are shut out from gospel offers and invitations, but those who obstinately and wickedly shut themselves out. But the application is to all believers, and only to such. It is to the weak as well as to the strong. Those who have received the doctrine of this common salvation, must contend for it, earnestly, not furiously. Lying for the truth is bad; scolding for it is not better. Those who have received the truth must contend for it, as the apostles did; by suffering with patience and courage for it, not by making others suffer if they will not embrace every notion we call faith, or important. We ought to contend earnestly for the faith, in opposition to those who would corrupt or deprave it; who creep in unawares; who glide in like serpents. And those are the worst of the ungodly, who take encouragement to sin boldly, because the grace of God has abounded, and still abounds so wonderfully, and who are hardened by the extent and fulness of gospel grace, the design of which is to deliver men from sin, and bring them unto God.</body></html>
