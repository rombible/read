The order of the three examples of signal punishment is in 2 Peter chronological: impure angels, flood, Sodom and Gomorrha; here not. But the order here is quite intelligible. St. Jude's main object is to warn his readers against that party in the Christian community who, by its abuse of Christian liberty, transformed the gospel of purity into a gospel of wantonness, and to give them a safeguard against such. And the safeguard is this: to hold fast the faith once for all delivered to them, and to remember the consequences of being unbelieving. For this purpose, no warning could be more apposite than the fate of Jude's own nation in the wilderness. This palmary instance given, two others follow, probably suggested by 2 Peter.<p><span class= "bld">Afterward destroyed</span>.--Better, <span class= "ital">secondly destroyed.</span> Wiclif, "the secunde tyme"; Rheims, "secondly." The Lord twice manifested His power on Israel: (1) in mercy; (2) in judgment. The reference is almost certainly to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-35.htm" title2="I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.">Numbers 14:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm" title2="Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers.">Deuteronomy 1:35</a>, &c. The destruction of Jerusalem can scarcely be meant, whatever date we assign to the Epistle, although the striking reading, "Jesus" for "the Lord," gives some countenance to such an interpretation. The most obvious meaning is, that the people destroyed were those who, in the first instance, were saved. Had the destruction of Jerusalem been intended, the reference would probably have been more clear.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">And the angels which kept not.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">because they kept not.</span> The construction is similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-25.htm" title2="But for as much as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.">Matthew 18:25</a>, "Forasmuch as he had not to pay." (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>.) This second instance of the impure angels has nothing to do with the original rebellion of Satan, or "fall of the angels." The reference is either to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm" title2="That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.">Genesis 6:2</a>, or (more probably), to passages in the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch.</span> (See <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of this Epistle.)<p><span class= "bld">Their first estate</span>.--The Greek word has two meanings: (1) beginning, which our translators have adopted here; (2) rule or power, which would be better. Wiclif has "prinshood;" Rheims, "principalitie." The word is translated "rule" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title2="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24</a>) and "principality" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm" title2="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm" title2="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title2="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title2="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title2=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm" title2=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title2=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm" title2="Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,">Titus 3:1</a>). The term belongs to the Jewish classification of angels, and here refers rather to their <span class= "ital">power</span> over things earthly than to the <span class= "ital">beginning</span> of their state. The two meanings are but two views of the same fact: their power or dignity <span class= "ital">was</span> their first estate. Some explain the word of the power of God over the angels; but both wording and context are against this.<p><span class= "bld">Their own habitation</span>.--<span class= "ital">Their proper home.</span> By leaving heaven and coming down to earth, they lost their power over the earth.

The reality of powers of evil may be inferred, apart from Scripture, from their effects. That some of these powers are personal, some not, some free, some not, and that all are to be defeated at last, seems to be implied in Scripture; but its silence is a rebuke to curious speculation. Enough is told us for our comfort, warning, and assurance. It consoles us to know that much of the evil of which we are conscious in ourselves is not our own, but comes from without. It puts us on our guard to know that we have such powers arrayed against us. It gives us confidence to know that we have abundant means of victory even over them.<p><span class= "bld">Under darkness.</span>--The Greek word occurs only here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-13.htm" title2="Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.">Jude 1:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title2="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-17.htm" title2="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2Peter 2:17</a>, and possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-18.htm" title2="For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,">Hebrews 12:18</a>.

The punishment of the submerged cities is perpetual; moreover, there are appearances as of volcanic fire under them.

They are cited as typical examples of the Divine retribution, with which the readers can be taken to be familiar, and which they will recognize to give point to the terror of the condemnation overhanging the men in question. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The first is taken from the history of Israel. It is introduced, not as a contrast with what precedes, but as a natural transition from it. It is given, too, as a matter quite within their knowledge, and of which consequently they need only to be reminded. The Authorized Version is short of the mark in several respects here. What the writer expresses is not the mere fact that he is to do a certain thing, but that he has the wish to do so. Hence the <span class="cmt_word">now I desire to put you in remembrance</span> of the Revised Version is preferable to the <span class="accented">I will therefore</span>, etc., of the Authorized Version. The next clause is more decidedly astray. For the term rendered" once" means "once for all," and the knowledge is given as a present possession. Hence the rendering should be <span class="cmt_word">though ye know once for all;</span> or better, <span class="accented">knowing as ye do</span> once <span class="accented">for all</span> - a form of expression which might be paraphrased in our English idiom, as Mr. Humphry rightly observes, "though ye have known all along." There is, however, very considerable difficulty in the reading here. It varies between "ye know <span class="accented">this"</span> which is accepted by the Authorized Version, "ye know <span class="accented">all things"</span> which is preferred by the Revised Version, and "ye <span class="accented">all</span> know" which, though poorly accredited, is yet supposed by Professor Herr to be not improbably the original. The documentary evidence is, on the whole, on the side of "all things;" and if this is adopted, the universal term will naturally be limited by the context to a knowledge of all that is pertinent to the point in question. This knowledge of the principles at issue in the case of these evil men, and of the retributive deeds of God by which these principles have been signally vindicated, is a reason why Jude needs simply to refresh the memories of his readers, and not to tell them anything new. In the second half of the verse there is a still more serious difficulty in the text. Instead of the term "Lord," some of the very best authorities read "Jesus." If this must be accepted, we have an act of the Jehovah of the Old Testament ascribed to the <span class="accented">Jesus</span> of the New Testament. But this would be an entirely unexampled usage. For, while the New Testament not unfrequently introduces the name of <span class="accented">Christ</span> when it refers to deeds of grace or claims of honour which the Old Testament connects with the name of Jehovah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, etc.), it never does this with that name of the Redeemer of the New Testament which specially marks his human nature and origin. Hence Professor Herr speaks of the reading "Jesus" here as a blunder, however supported. The ordinary reading may, therefore, be adhered to, especially as it is by no means ill accredited, having on its side two of the primary uncials and other weighty authorities. These clauses are peculiar in other respects. They speak not of "the people" as the Authorized Version puts it, but rather of "a people." And this is not without its purpose. For the idea is not simply that the ancient Israel experienced both redemption and judgment at the hands of their Lord, but that Israel's Lord, by bringing Israel out of Egypt, secured a people for himself, though he had also to destroy unbelievers among them. Again, the phrase rendered "afterward" by the Authorized Version means strictly "the second time," as is noticed by the margin of the Revised Version. What is intended, therefore, may be that Israel was the subject of two great deeds on Jehovah's part - in the first instance a redeeming deed, in <span class="accented">the second instance</span> a punitive deed. And his purpose in seeking a people for himself was not inconsistent with his doing what he did in this second instance. What, then, is referred to? Those seem to interpret it best who take it to be a general reference to the wilderness-fate of unbelieving Israel, rather than to any single instance of the terrors of the Divine judgment, such as that reported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-9</a>. It is far-fetched to suppose that the event in view is one so remote from the deliverance of Israel from Egypt as the Babylonian captivity. We may compare with this verse, therefore, such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-12.htm">Psalm 106:12-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-4:5</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-7 Outward privileges, profession, and apparent conversion, could not secure those from the vengeance of God, who turned aside in unbelief and disobedience. The destruction of the unbelieving Israelites in the wilderness, shows that none ought to presume on their privileges. They had miracles as their daily bread; yet even they perished in unbelief. A great number of the angels were not pleased with the stations God allotted to them; pride was the main and direct cause or occasion of their fall. The fallen angels are kept to the judgment of the great day; and shall fallen men escape it? Surely not. Consider this in due time. The destruction of Sodom is a loud warning to all, to take heed of, and flee from fleshly lusts that war against the soul,</body></html>
