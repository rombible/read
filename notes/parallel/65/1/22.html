Moreover these six brothers accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:">Acts 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-20.htm" title2="He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;">Romans 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-23.htm" title2="And he that doubts is damned if he eat, because he eats not of faith: for whatever is not of faith is sin.">Romans 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm" title2="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.

This, then, is the first and least hopeless class--those who are still in doubt, though inclined the wrong way. They may still be remonstrated with, convicted of error, and reclaimed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm" title2="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm" title2="This witness is true. Why rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;">Titus 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm" title2="Let him know, that he which converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.">James 5:20</a>). Some would make this first class the worst and most hopeless--those who are to be argued down in disputation, but without much chance of success. Such interpreters make the third class the best: those who can probably be saved by gentle means. The Greek here is so ambiguous that we cannot be certain of the meaning. But the addition of "in fear" and "hating even the garment spotted by the flesh" to the directions respecting the third class, seems to indicate that that class is the worst.<p>(23) <span class= "bld">And others save with fear.</span>--"With fear" must certainly be omitted, as no part of the true text. "Save" should perhaps be <span class= "ital">try to save.</span> It is the present imperative, not the aorist.<p><span class= "bld">Pulling them out of the fire.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">snatching them out of the fire.</span> We have here another reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title2="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-3</a> : we had one in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title2="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm" title2="I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:11</a>.) The fire of the judgment to come is probably not meant; rather the imminent danger (as of one who is asleep in a burning house) in which the fire of their sins keeps them. This is the second class: those who can still be rescued, but by strong measures.<p>After the words "out of the fire" we must insert another clause omitted from the inferior Greek texts used by our translators: "and on others have compassion in fear." Wiclif and the Rhemish version, following the Vulgate, have this clause. This is the third and worst class: those on whom profound pity is all that we dare bestow, and that in fear and trembling, lest by contact with them we may be brought within the influence of the deadly contamination that clings to all their surroundings. Abhorrence must be shown to the very externals of pollution. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title2="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title2="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1Timothy 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/3-10.htm" title2="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-16.htm" title2="If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not to death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not to death. There is a sin to death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.">1John 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_john/1-10.htm" title2="If there come any to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:">2John 1:10-11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-23 Sensual men separate from Christ, and his church, and join themselves to the devil, the world, and the flesh, by ungodly and sinful practices. That is infinitely worse than to separate from any branch of the visible church on account of opinions, or modes and circumstances of outward government or worship. Sensual men have not the spirit of holiness, which whoever has not, does not belong to Christ. The grace of faith is most holy, as it works by love, purifies the heart, and overcomes the world, by which it is distinguished from a false and dead faith. Our prayers are most likely to prevail, when we pray in the Holy Ghost, under his guidance and influence, according to the rule of his word, with faith, fervency, and earnestness; this is praying in the Holy Ghost. And a believing expectation of eternal life will arm us against the snares of sin: lively faith in this blessed hope will help us to mortify our lusts. We must watch over one another; faithfully, yet prudently reprove each other, and set a good example to all about us. This must be done with compassion, making a difference between the weak and the wilful. Some we must treat with tenderness. Others save with fear; urging the terrors of the Lord. All endeavours must be joined with decided abhorrence of crimes, and care be taken to avoid whatever led to, or was connected with fellowship with them, in works of darkness, keeping far from what is, or appears to be evil.</body></html>
