That is not a certain inference from the previous verse. What that verse makes clear is that it had been Jude's purpose to compose an Epistle on the general subject of the common salvation, and that something emerged which made him change his plan and write a letter dealing with certain specific matters of urgent importance, and hortatory in its form. The circumstance which led to this change is here stated - it was the appearance of a corrupt and insidious party in the Church. <span class="cmt_word">For,</span> he says, <span class="cmt_word">there are certain men crept in unawares;</span> or, as the Revised Version more forcibly renders it, <span class="accented">privily.</span> The verb describes the men as men who had no rightful standing in the Church, but had made their way into it secretly and by false pretences. Compare Paul's description of the "false brethren unawares brought in, the came in privily to spy out our liberty. which we have in Christ Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>); but especially the picture which two of the latest Epistles give of the "false teachers who privily shall bring in damnable heresies" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>), and those who "creep into houses and lead captive silly women" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>). The men thus generally described are next designated more precisely as those <span class="cmt_word">who were before of old ordained to this condemnation.</span> So the Authorized Version renders it. But the point is more correctly caught by the <span class="accented">"even</span> they who" of the Revised Version. The men just spoken of in general terms are immediately described as the <span class="accented">very men</span> to whom something more precise applies, which is now to be stated. There is some difficulty, however, as to the exact sense of the statement. The term which is translated "ordained" by the Authorized Version is of doubtful interpretation, the doubt turning on the question whether it has a <span class="accented">temporal</span> or <span class="accented">a local</span> reference. The latter idea seems to be expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>, where the verb means either <span class="accented">publicly placarded</span> or <span class="accented">openly set forth</span> ("evidently set forth," according to the Authorized Version). For the most part, however, the <span class="accented">temporal</span> sense prevails, and that this is the sense here is confirmed by the fact that the verb is connected with the temporal adverb "of old." It has been contended that the biblical figure of a book of the Divine counsels is at the basis of the expression here, and that it should be rendered "ordained" (with the Authorized Version), in the Calvinistic sense of "foreordained." But this is opposed by the fact that the term here rendered" of old" is not applied in the New Testament to the eternal purpose of God. The reference, therefore, is to ancient prophecy, and the term means "who were of old written of," "who were of old set forth," as the Revised Version puts it, or "designated" in prophecy. The writer does not specify what particular prophecies are in view. Hence some take them to be predictions of the evils of the last days spoken of by the apostles, such as we find recorded in the Pastoral Epistles and in 2 Peter. But the force of the phrase "of old," in its present connection, points to what is of ancient date in the stricter sense. The Old Testament prophecies, therefore, are probably those referred to, and the fact that mention is made by-and-by of Enoch as one of the prophets of old, makes it likely that the predictive sections of the book which bears his name are also in the author's mind. The phrase, "to this condemnation," explains that unto which these men were prophetically designated in ancient time. The noun denotes usually, if not invariably, the judgment of a judge on something wrong, and here, therefore, it seems to have the sense of penal judgment or condemnation. It is not quite apparent what judgment is intended. It is supposed by some that the writer is looking to the unhappy relations of these men to the Church, and finds in these relations and in the moral conditions thereby revealed the judgment 'of God upon them. It is more probable that he refers to the penal retribution, of which he is immediately to give examples. Three strokes are added to the picture of the men. These bring out in darkest outline both their character and their faith. There is first the general description of them as ungodly men - impious men, in whom there is no spirit of reverence, as the adjective literally implies. The same note appears in Peter's description (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5, 6</a>). (Compare the use of the same term in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-5.htm">Romans 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>.) This ungodliness is next shown to take the form of an immoral perversion of spiritual privilege - <span class="cmt_word">turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness.</span> By the grace of God is meant the whole gift of redemption offered in <span class="accented">the</span> gospel. It is called here the grace of <span class="accented">our</span> God; the turn thus given to the expression indicating at once the dear and intimate relation to God into which the writer and his fellows in the faith have been introduced, and their shuddering sense of the shameless use to which his gift was debased. The thing to which that grace was perverted is described by a word of wide and evil application, denoting every species of unbridled conduct, but particularly unblushing licentiousness. The same ungodliness in these men is further declared to rise to a denial and disavowal of all Divine claims upon them. The Revised Version, which is more rigorously true to the original here than the Authorized Version, gives an alternative rendering, <span class="cmt_word">denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ,</span> in the text, but <span class="accented">denying the only Master, and our Lord Jesus Christ</span> in the margin. The question is whether God and Christ are separately mentioned as both objects of the denial, or whether Christ alone is referred to; both the titles, <span class="accented">Master</span> and <span class="accented">Lord</span>, being applied to him. The question is not easy to decide. Among the strongest arguments in favour of the latter view are the two considerations that the attitude of these men to God has been already stated in the previous clause, and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a> we find both the verb and the noun which are used here applied to Christ. On the other side, it is urged that the parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22</a> favours the double reference here; that the title here rendered "Master" is never applied to Christ except in the single instance of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>; that the epithet "only" is used more properly of God, as in verse 25 of this same Epistle; that it is difficult to distinguish between the two titles, if both are referred to Christ here; and that the analogous expression in the Book of Enoch (48:10) is to be considered. The case is stronger on the whole on the side of the twofold subject being in view. But it is further asked whether this denial of God and of Christ is meant to be a theoretical denial or a practical. It is the practical disavowal of God, which appears in a godless and unbridled life, that seems chiefly in view. But there is no good reason for excluding the idea of corrupt doctrine or teaching. The latter is not expressed, it is true, in the terms adopted in the Epistles of John. Neither is there anything to warrant the supposition that the writer was thinking of Simon Magus in particular, or of Carpocrates, or any of the early Gnostics - a supposition entertained both by the earliest Christian writers and by some in our own time. But it is possible enough that the seeds which were to develop into the pronounced Gnosticism of a later time were already sown, and that in such speculative error Jude saw the ally of a life which was regardless of all Divine restraint. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Christians are called out of the world, from the evil spirit and temper of it; called above the world, to higher and better things, to heaven, things unseen and eternal; called from sin to Christ, from vanity to seriousness, from uncleanness to holiness; and this according to the Divine purpose and grace. If sanctified and glorified, all the honour and glory must be ascribed to God, and to him alone. As it is God who begins the work of grace in the souls of men, so it is he who carries it on, and perfects it. Let us not trust in ourselves, nor in our stock of grace already received, but in him, and in him alone. The mercy of God is the spring and fountain of all the good we have or hope for; mercy, not only to the miserable, but to the guilty. Next to mercy is peace, which we have from the sense of having obtained mercy. From peace springs love; Christ's love to us, our love to him, and our brotherly love to one another. The apostle prays, not that Christians may be content with a little; but that their souls and societies may be full of these things. None are shut out from gospel offers and invitations, but those who obstinately and wickedly shut themselves out. But the application is to all believers, and only to such. It is to the weak as well as to the strong. Those who have received the doctrine of this common salvation, must contend for it, earnestly, not furiously. Lying for the truth is bad; scolding for it is not better. Those who have received the truth must contend for it, as the apostles did; by suffering with patience and courage for it, not by making others suffer if they will not embrace every notion we call faith, or important. We ought to contend earnestly for the faith, in opposition to those who would corrupt or deprave it; who creep in unawares; who glide in like serpents. And those are the worst of the ungodly, who take encouragement to sin boldly, because the grace of God has abounded, and still abounds so wonderfully, and who are hardened by the extent and fulness of gospel grace, the design of which is to deliver men from sin, and bring them unto God.</body></html>
