St. Jude perhaps has this passage in his mind. (See below, second Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>.) "Dreamers" may perhaps refer to the empty speculations of these men.<p><span class= "bld">Defile the flesh.</span>--Like the inhabitants of the cities of the plain.

Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2Peter 2:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Speak evil of dignities.</span>--Like the murmurers in the wilderness.

(Comp. the doctrine of Menander, Irenaeus, I. xxiii. 5.)<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Yet Michael the archangel.</span>--These libertines allow themselves to use language against celestial beings which even an archangel did not venture to use against Satan.

In the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch</span> his meekness is spoken of; he is "the merciful, <span class= "ital">the patient, </span>the holy Michael," Enoch 40:8.<p><span class= "bld">He disputed about the body of Moses</span>.--To be understood quite literally: to make "the body of Moses" into a metaphor for the people of Israel, or the Mosaic law, is most unnatural. This passage is the only evidence extant of any such incident or tradition. The nearest approach to it is the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-6.htm" title2="And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knows of his sepulcher to this day.">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>, which says that Michael was the appointed guardian of Moses' grave. According to Origen (<span class= "ital">De Princip.</span> III. ii. 1) the source of it is a book called the <span class= "ital">Ascension, </span>or <span class= "ital">Assumption of Moses.</span> Evidently it is something supposed to be well known to those whom St. Jude is addressing, and it appears to be given as a fact which he believes, though we cannot be sure of this. In any case it does not follow that we are to believe in it as an historical fact. Reverent, and therefore cautious, theories of inspiration need not exclude the possibility of an unhistorical incident being cited as an illustration or a warning. St. Paul makes use of the Jewish legend of the rock following the Israelites in the wilderness as an illustration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title2="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>). The strange question, "What did the devil want with the body of Moses?" has been asked, and answered in more ways than one:--(1) to make it an object of idolatry, as the Israelites would be very likely to worship it; (2) to keep it as his own, as that of a murderer, because Moses killed the Egyptian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-12.htm" title2="And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.">Exodus 2:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Durst not . . .</span>--Out of respect to Satan's original angelic nature. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-1.htm" title2="Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?">1Corinthians 6:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A railing accusation</span>.--More literally, <span class= "ital">a sentence savouring of evil-speaking.</span> Wiclif, "doom"; Tyndale and Cranmer, "sentence"; Rheims, "judgment." Michael brought no sentence against the devil, but left all judgment to God.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord rebuke thee</span>.--The same rebuke <span class= "ital">is</span> administered to Satan by the angel of Jehovah, when Satan appears as the adversary of Joshua the high priest, the restorer of the temple and of the daily sacrifice, and one of the Old Testament types of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm" title2="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>). It is probable that the tradition here given by St. Jude is derived from this passage in Zechariah, or from a source common to both. We have another reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm" title2="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-23.htm" title2="And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.">Jude 1:23</a>.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">But these . . .</span>--In strong contrast to the scrupulous reverence of the archangel. "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."<p><span class= "bld">Those things which they know not.</span>--The "dignities" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>. This shows that unseen spiritual powers are there meant: these men would know earthly rulers. It is on the unseen that they show their irreverence.<p><span class= "bld">What they know naturally.</span>--The means of gratifying their desires. The two halves of the verse are in emphatic contrast. What they do not know, and cannot know, they abuse by gross irreverence: what they know, and cannot help knowing, they abuse by gross licentiousness. If this Epistle is prior to 2 Peter it is strange that the author of the latter should have neglected so telling an antithesis, and should (from a literary point of view) have so spoiled the passage by his mode of adaptation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm" title2="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2Peter 2:12</a>). If 2 Peter is prior there is nothing strange in St. Jude improving upon the mode of expression. The word for "know" is not the same in both clauses. The word used in "which they know not" is the most general and common word of the kind in Greek, expressing mere perception, and occurring about three hundred times in the New Testament; that used in "what they know naturally" is more definite, and expresses practical experience productive of skill and science; it occurs fourteen times in the New Testament, mostly in the Acts. (Comp. "Paul I know," <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-15.htm" title2="And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?">Acts 19:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">They corrupt themselves.</span>--Or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">they work their own ruin.</span> Note the tense; not future, but present. The corruption, or <span class= "ital">ruin, </span>is not a judgment hanging over them; it is already going on.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Having set in the forefront of his warnings these terrible instances of gross sin and overwhelming penalty, the writer proceeds to deal with the real character of the insidious troublers and corrupters of the Churches of his time. He describes them as <span class="cmt_word">filthy dreamers;</span> or better, as the Revised Version puts it, <span class="accented">men in their dreamings</span> - an expression pointing to the foul and perverted fancies in the service of which they lived. He charges them with the particular sins of defiling the flesh, despising dominion, and railing at dignities. He further declares of them that, in practicing such sins, they run a course like that of the cities of the plain, and run it in defiance, too, of the warning held forth to them by the case of Sodom and Gomorrah. For such seems the point of the terms connecting this paragraph with the preceding, which are best rendered "nevertheless in like manner," or "yet in like manner" (Revised Version). The difficulty lies, however, in the description of their offences. What is intended by the charge that they <span class="cmt_word">defile the flesh</span> is obvious. But what is referred to in the other clauses, <span class="cmt_word">and set at naught dominion</span> (or, <span class="accented">lordship</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and rail at dignities</span> (or, <span class="accented">glories</span>), is far from clear. It has been supposed that a lawlessness is meant which expressed itself in contempt for all earthly authority, whether political or ecclesiastical. The whole scope of the passage, however, and the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>, etc., seem to point so decidedly to higher dignities than the earthly institutions of Church and State, that most interpreters now think that celestial lordship of some kind is in view. But of what kind? That of <span class="accented">God</span> and that of <span class="accented">good angels</span>, say some. That of <span class="accented">Christ</span> and that of <span class="accented">angels</span>, say others. Both clauses, say a third class of interpreters, refer to angels, both to good angels and to evil, or to good angels alone, or to evil angels alone, as the allusions are variously understood. Pointing to the particular word which is used here for "dominion" or "lordship," some contend that there is a definite reference to the dominion of <span class="accented">Christ</span>, the <span class="accented">Lord</span> distinctively so called. But the same word is used elsewhere (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>) of angels, while the term translated "dignities," or "glories," occurs again only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>. If, therefore, any single kind of lordship is in view, we should conclude in favour of angelic dignities, and the authority of good angels in particular. But it may be that Jude uses the terms here in a general sense to cover all kinds of authority, especially celestial authority. This is favoured by the undefined expressions which meet us in the Petrine parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>, etc.). It is supported, too, by the consideration that in leveling three separate charges against the men, Jude has probably in view the three separate cases which he has just cited in verses 5-7. In which case the parallel between these latter and the men now described can naturally be only of a general kind. It is remarked by Professor Plumptre that the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>, etc. (see his Commentary), taken in connection with this one in Jude, suggests that "the undue worshipping of angels in the Judaizing Gnosticism which had developed out of the teaching of the Essenes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>), had been met by its most extreme opponents with coarse and railing mockery as to all angels, whether good or evil, and that the apostle felt it necessary to rebuke this license of speech as well as that which paid no respect to human authority." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 False teachers are dreamers; they greatly defile and grievously wound the soul. These teachers are of a disturbed mind and a seditious spirit; forgetting that the powers that be, are ordained of God, Ro 13:1. As to the contest about the body of Moses, it appears that Satan wished to make the place of his burial known to the Israelites, in order to tempt them to worship him, but he was prevented, and vented his rage in desperate blasphemy. This should remind all who dispute never to bring railing charges. Also learn hence, that we ought to defend those whom God owns. It is hard, if not impossible, to find any enemies to the Christian religion, who did not, and do not, live in open or secret contradiction to the principles of natural religion. Such are here compared to brute beasts, though they often boast of themselves as the wisest of mankind. They corrupt themselves in the things most open and plain. The fault lies, not in their understandings, but in their depraved wills, and their disordered appetites and affections. It is a great reproach, though unjust to religion, when those who profess it are opposed to it in heart and life. The Lord will remedy this in his time and way; not in men's blind way of plucking up the wheat with the tares. It is sad when men begin in the Spirit, and end in the flesh. Twice dead; they had been once dead in their natural, fallen state; but now they are dead again by the evident proofs of their hypocrisy. Dead trees, why cumber they the ground! Away with them to the fire. Raging waves are a terror to sailing passengers; but when they get into port, the noise and terror are ended. False teachers are to expect the worst punishments in this world and in that to come. They glare like meteors, or falling stars, and then sink into the blackness of darkness for ever. We have no mention of the prophecy of Enoch in any other part or place of Scripture; yet one plain text of Scripture, proves any point we are to believe. We find from this, that Christ's coming to judge was prophesied of, as early as the times before the flood. The Lord cometh: what a glorious time will that be! Notice how often the word ungodly is repeated. Many now do not at all refer to the terms godly, or ungodly, unless it be to mock at even the words; but it is not so in the language taught us by the Holy Ghost. Hard speeches of one another, especially if ill-grounded, will certainly come into account at the day of judgment. These evil men and seducers are angry at every thing that happens, and never pleased with their own state and condition. Their will and their fancy, are their only rule and law. Those who please their sinful appetites, are most prone to yield to ungovernable passions. The men of God, from the beginning of the world, have declared the doom denounced on them. Such let us avoid. We are to follow men only as they follow Christ.</body></html>
