The divisions are clearly marked, each section beginning with "These are" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm" title2="These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.">Jude 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-19.htm" title2="These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.">Jude 1:19</a>).<p>(12-15) Description corresponding to Cain.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">These are the rocks in your feasts of charity, banqueting with you fearlessly</span> (see next Note); or, <span class= "ital">These are they who banquet together fearlessly, rocks in your feasts of charity.</span> The former is preferable. But in any case we must probably read <span class= "ital">rocks</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that on which those who meet them at your love-feasts will be wrecked (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title2="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20-22</a>)--not "spots," which is borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>. But it is just possible that as <span class= "ital">spiloi, </span>St. Peter's word, may mean either "spots" or "rocks" (though most commonly the former), so St. Jude's word (<span class= "ital">spilades</span>) may mean either "spots" or "rocks" (though almost invariably the latter). In an Orphic poem of the fourth century, <span class= "ital">spilades</span> means "spots "; but this is rather late authority for its use in the first century. Here "rocks" is the safer translation. St. Peter is dwelling on the sensuality of these sinners, and for him "spots" is the more obvious metaphor. St. Jude, in tracing an analogy between them and Cain, would be more likely to select "rocks." These libertines, like Cain, turned the ordinances of religion into selfishness and sin: both, like sunken rocks, destroyed those who unsuspectingly approached them. On the difference of reading respecting the word for "feasts of charity," or "love-feasts," see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>. Possibly the name <span class= "ital">Agapae</span> for such feasts comes from this passage. Had it been common when St. Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 11, he would probably have made a point of it; love-feasts in which there was no love. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-14.htm" title2="Greet you one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.">1Peter 5:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Feeding themselves without fear.</span> "Without fear" goes better with "feasting with you"; but the Greek admits of either construction. "Feeding themselves" instead of the poorer members of the flock; whereas feeding the poor was one great object of the love-feasts. Others explain, "feeding themselves" (literally, <span class= "ital">pasturing themselves</span>) instead of waiting to be tended by the shepherds. The former is better, the scandal being similar to that described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title2="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1Corinthians 11:21</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-11.htm" title2="Yes, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.">Isaiah 56:11</a>, which St. Jude may possibly have had in his mind; and see above, second Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm" title2="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Clouds without water</span>.--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-14.htm" title2="Whoever boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.">Proverbs 25:14</a>. The meaning is not that these men bring much food to the love-feasts and give nothing away: there is no longer any allusion to the love-feasts. Rather, these men are ostentatious generally, and yet do no good inflated and empty. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-17.htm" title2="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2Peter 2:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Carried about of winds.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">borne past</span> (without giving any rain) <span class= "ital">by winds</span>; or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">driven out of their course</span> (and so showing their flimsiness) <span class= "ital">by winds.</span><p><span class= "bld">Trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit.</span>--There is no such strange contradiction in the Greek, nor in any of the earlier English versions. The meaning rather is, <span class= "ital">autumn trees</span> (which ought to be full of fruit, and yet are) <span class= "ital">without fruit</span>; in allusion, probably, to the barren fig-tree. Others, less simply, explain "trees in <span class= "ital">late</span> autumn"--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, stripped and bare. But for this we should expect "winter trees" rather than "autumn trees."<p><span class= "bld">Twice dead.</span>--Utterly dead, and hence "plucked up by the roots." Spiritually these men were "twice dead" in having returned, after baptism, to the death of sin. The writer piles up metaphor on metaphor and epithet on epithet in the effort to express his indignation and abhorrence. The epithets here are in logical order: in autumn, fruitless, dead, rooted up.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Foaming out their own shame.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">shames</span>, their shameful acts. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm" title2="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.">Isaiah 57:20</a> is probably in St. Jude's mind: "The wicked are like the troubled sea, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."<p><span class= "bld">Wandering stars.</span>--Nothing is gained by understanding comets, which have their orbits, and do not wander, in St. Jude's sense, any more than planets do. The image is that of stars leaving their place in the heavens, where they are beautiful and useful, and wandering away (to the utter confusion of every one who directs his course by them) into sunless gloom, where their light is extinguished, and whence they cannot return. This simile suits the "false teachers of 2 Peter better than the "ungodly" of Jude. Would the writer of 2 Peter have neglected to avail himself of it?<p>(14) <span class= "bld">And Enoch also.</span>--On the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch, </span>and this famous quotation from it, see <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of the Epistle. The following passage from Irenaeus (IV. Xvi. 2) shows that he was acquainted with the book, and throws light on St. Jude's use of it:--"Enoch also, pleasing God without circumcision, was God's ambassador to the angels, although he was a man, and was raised to heaven, and is preserved even until now as a witness of the just judgment of God. For the angels by transgression fell to earth for judgment, while a man, by pleasing God, was raised to heaven for salvation." The mission of Enoch to the fallen angels is narrated in the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch, </span>12-16.<p><span class= "bld">The seventh from Adam.</span>--This is not inserted without special meaning. It was scarcely needed to distinguish the son of Jared from the son of Cain; in that case it would have been more simple to say, "the son of Jared." It either points to the extreme antiquity of the prophecy, or else to the mystical and sabbatical number seven. Enoch (see preceding Note) was a type of perfected humanity, and hence the notion of "divine completion and rest" is perhaps suggested here. Thus, Augustine, in his reply to Faustus the Manichaean (xii. 14):--"Enoch, <span class= "ital">the seventh from Adam, </span>pleased God and was translated, as there is to be a <span class= "ital">seventh day of rest, </span>in which all will be translated who during the sixth day of the world's history are created anew by the incarnate Word." Several of the numbers connected with Enoch in Genesis seem to be symmetrical, and intended to convey a meaning.<p><span class= "bld">With ten thousands of his saints.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">among His holy myriads</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>encircled by them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title2="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm" title2="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>.)<p>(15) <span class= "bld">To execute judgment.</span>--The Greek phrase occurs only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm" title2="And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.">John 5:27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To convince.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to convict.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-46.htm" title2="Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?">John 8:46</a>, and see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" title2="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>, and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title2="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:">1Corinthians 14:24</a>.) The words "among them" must be omitted, as wanting in authority.<p><span class= "bld">Hard speeches.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-60.htm" title2="Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?">John 6:60</a>, the only other place where this epithet is applied to words. The meaning is somewhat similar in each case: harsh, repulsive, inhuman. It does not mean "hard to understand." Nabal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-3.htm" title2="Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.">1Samuel 25:3</a>) has this epithet with the LXX., where the Authorised version has "churlish." In the Ethiopic version of the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch</span> there appears to be nothing to represent "hard speeches . . . spoken" in this passage.<p>(16-18) Description corresponding to Balaam.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">Complainers.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">discontented with their lot.</span> Men who "shape their course according to their own lusts" can never be content, for (1) the means of gratifying them are not always present, and (2) the lusts are insatiable. Such was eminently the case with Balaam, in his cupidity and his chafing against the restraints which prevented him from gratitifying it. There is a possible reference to this verse in the <span class= "ital">Shepherd</span> of Hermas (<span class= "ital">Sim. </span>IX. xix. 3).<p><span class= "bld">Great swelling words.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-18.htm" title2="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2Peter 2:18</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Having men's persons in admiration</span>.--More simply, <span class= "ital">admiring persons</span> (so the Rhemish version)--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>having regard to people of distinction, as Balaam to Balak. These ungodly men were courtiers, flatterers, and parasites.<p><span class= "bld">Because of advantage.</span>--<span class= "ital">For the sake of advantage</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to gain something by it: like "for reward" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-11.htm" title2="Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.">Jude 1:11</a>). Exactly Balaam's case. Note that each half of the verse falls into an irregular triplet.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">But, beloved.</span>--Better, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-20.htm" title2="But you, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,">Jude 1:20</a>, <span class= "ital">But ye, beloved. "</span>Ye" is emphatic in both cases: "ye," in contrast to these impious men. All previous English versions insert the "ye." While taking the form of an exhortation, the passage still remains virtually descriptive. "Be not ye deceived by their impudent boasting and interested pandering, for these are the scoffing sensualists against whom the Apostles warned you."<p><span class= "bld">Spoken before of the apostles.</span>--The old use of "of" for "by," like "carried about of winds" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-19.htm" title2="While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.">2Peter 2:19</a>.) St. Jude implies that this warning of the Apostles is well known to those whom he addresses. This appeal to the authority of Apostles would be more naturally made by one who was not an Apostle, but cannot be regarded as decisive. See <span class= "ital">Introduction, </span>I., and Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-2.htm" title2="That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:">2Peter 3:2</a>, to which, however, this is not quite parallel, for the writer there has already declared himself to be an Apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title2="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>). There is nothing to show that the author of our Epistle regards the Apostles as considerably removed in time from himself. "In the last time is <span class= "ital">their</span> expression, not his; and by it <span class= "ital">they</span> did not mean any age remote from themselves. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title2="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1John 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title2="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2Timothy 3:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm" title2="For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,">2Timothy 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title2="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title2="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>.)<p>(18) <span class= "bld">How that they told you.</span>--Or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">used to tell you:</span> but we cannot infer from this that oral teaching exclusively is meant. This, again, leaves the question of the writer's position open. Had St. Jude written "how that they told <span class= "ital">us,"</span> it would have been decisive against his being an Apostle.<p><span class= "bld">There should be mockers.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that there shall be scoffers.</span> The quotation is direct, and is introduced formally by a word which in Greek commonly precedes a direct quotation. This, however, scarcely amounts to proof that the quotation is from a written document. The word for "mockers" here is the same as that translated "scoffers" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm" title2="Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,">2Peter 3:3</a>. The translation should be the same in both passages.<p><span class= "bld">In the last time.</span>--These words had better come first: <span class= "ital">that in the last time there shall be scoffers.</span><p><span class= "bld">Who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">walking according to their own lusts of impieties.</span> The force of the genitive may be merely adjectival, as the Authorised version renders it: but as it may indicate the things lusted for, it is better to keep a literal rendering of it.<p>(19) Description corresponding to Korah.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">These be they.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">These are they--</span>for the sake of making the openings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm" title2="These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.">Jude 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-19.htm" title2="These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.">Jude 1:19</a> exactly alike, as they are in the Greek.<p><span class= "bld">Who separate themselves.</span>--"Themselves" must be omitted, the evidence against it being overwhelming. "Who separate:" who are creating a schism, like Korah and his company; claiming to be the chief and most enlightened members in the community to which they still profess to belong, though they turn upside down its fundamental principles. The context rather leads us to suppose that these libertines claimed to be the only "spiritual" Christians, inasmuch as they said that to their exalted spiritual natures the things of sense were purely indifferent, and might be indulged in without loss or risk; while they taunted other Christians, who regulated their conduct carefully with regard to such things, with being <span class= "ital">psychic</span> or "sensuous." Note the three-fold division of the verse.<p><span class= "bld">Sensual.</span>--The Greek word is <span class= "ital">psychic, </span>and has no English equivalent; "sensuous" would perhaps be best. The LXX. do not use it, but it occurs six times in the New Testament. Four times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title2="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1Corinthians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title2="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1Corinthians 15:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-46.htm" title2="However, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.">1Corinthians 15:46</a>) it is translated "natural" (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title2="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1Corinthians 2:14</a>); once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm" title2="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">James 3:15</a>), "sensual," with "natural" in the margin; and here simply "sensual." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title2="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1Corinthians 15:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-46.htm" title2="However, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.">1Corinthians 15:46</a>, the moral meaning is in the background; in the other three passages the moral meaning is prominent and is distinctly bad. <span class= "ital">Psychic</span> is the middle term of a triplet of terms, "carnal, <span class= "ital">psychic, </span>spiritual." "Carnal" and "spiritual<span class= "ital">"</span> speak for themselves--the one bad, the other good. <span class= "ital">Psychic, </span>which comes between, is much closer to "carnal," and with it is opposed to "spiritual." This is more clearly seen in the Latin equivalents--<span class= "ital">carnalis, animalis, spiritalis.</span> The carnal man is ruled by his passions, and rises little above the level of the brutes. The psychic man is ruled by human reasoning, and human affections, and does not rise above the world of sense. The spiritual man is ruled by his spirit--the noblest part of his nature--and this is ruled by the Spirit of God. He rises to and lives among those things which can only be "spiritually discerned." Our Christian psychology is seriously affected by the absence of any English word for <span class= "ital">psychic</span>--the part of man's nature which it represents is often lost sight of.<p><span class= "bld">Having not the Spirit.</span>--Or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">because they have no spirit.</span> The Holy Spirit may be meant, although the Greek word has no article; but more probably spiritual power and insight is what is meant. These men had allowed the spiritual part of then nature, of which they talked so much, to become so buried in the mire of sensual indulgence and human self-sufficiency, that it was utterly inoperative and practically non-existent. The form of negative used in the Greek seems to imply that their "having no spirit" is the reason why they are justly called "sensuous."<p>Each of these three descriptions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jude/1-12.htm" title2="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12-19</a>) is shorter than the preceding one. The writer hurries through an unpalatable subject to the more pleasing duty of exhorting those faithful Christians for whose sake he is writing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - The next two verses carry on the description of the men in a running fire of epithets and figures, short, sharp, and piercing, corresponding also at certain points with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13-17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear.</span> What is referred to appears not to be ordinary friendly gatherings or occasions for the interchange of affection, but the well-known <span class="accented">agapae</span>, or love-feasts, of the primitive Church, the meals provided in connection with the Lord's Supper, at which rich and poor sat down together. In adopting the rendering "spots," the English Version follows Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan, and the Rhemish, and is followed by some good interpreters on the ground that the term, though formally different, is essentially the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>. The word itself, however, properly means "rocks," and therefore the point may be that their immoral conduct makes these men like treacherous reefs, on which their fellows make shipwreck. So the Revised Version gives "hidden rocks" in the text, and transfers "spots" to the margin. The "without fear," which is usually attached to the third clause, is connected by some with the second, in which case it expresses the reckless, irreverent spirit in which these men joined in the sacred <span class="accented">agape.</span> The last clause, "feeding [or, 'pasturing'] themselves," describes them further as having no regard to the proper object of these love-feasts in ministering to Christian fellowship and the holy sense of brotherhood, but as using them simply as a means for the saris-faction of their own appetites and the furtherance of their own base ends. Compare the evils referred to by Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>, and the description of the shepherds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>. "They are like shepherds," says Humphry, "that have themselves for their flocks, feasting themselves, not their sheep, and doing this without fear of the chief Shepherd, who has his eye upon them." <span class="cmt_word">Clouds they are without water, carried about of winds;</span> or, <span class="accented">carried past by winds.</span> Like rainless clouds, the sport of the uncertain breezes, yielding nothing for the fruitfulness of earth, these empty, volatile, inconstant men disappoint the expectation of the Church and do it no service. Trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. The Authorized Version is less happy than usual in its rendering of the first clause. The Revised Version, in adopting "autumn trees" instead of "trees whose fruit withereth," returns to the renderings of the earlier versions, Wickliffe giving "harvest trees," Tyndale and Cranmer "trees without fruit at gathering-time," and the Rhemish "trees of autumn." The idea of <span class="accented">uselessness</span> and <span class="accented">unfruitfulness</span>, which was expressed in the previous figure, is repeated, but in a more absolute form, in this new figure. The late autumn is not the time, from the Eastern point of view, for the putting forth of fruit. The tree then becomes bare, barren, leafless. So is it with these men. Nor is it only that they have no fruit to show. The capacity of fruitfulness is extinct within them. The possibility of recovering it is gone from them. They are as dead to all good service as trees are which are rooted out as hopelessly useless. The phrase, "twice dead," may mean no more than "utterly dead." The point, however, is rather this - that they are dead, not only in respect of barrenness - which is a death in life - but in respect of the extinction of all vitality. <span class="cmt_word">Raging</span> (or, <span class="accented">wild</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;</span> or <span class="accented">shames</span>, as the original gives it; that is to say, <span class="accented">shameful deeds</span>, or, it may be, the <span class="accented">degrading lusts</span> which inspire their unlicensed life (Huther). This comparison recalls at once the figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Wandering stars, to whom is</span> (or, <span class="accented">has been</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</span> In the Book of Enoch (chapter 18:14) the angel shows the prophet "a prison for the stars of heaven, and for the host of heaven," and in the next verse it is explained that "the stars that roll over the fire are they who have transgressed the command of God before their rising, because they did not come forth in their time." It is possible that Jude had this in mind here, as the language of earlier chapters of the same book may have suggested others of Jude's figures. If the "wandering stars" are to be identified with any particular order of the heavenly bodies, it will be with the comets rather than the planets, the movements of the former seeming, to the common eye, so much the more erratic. The doom which is declared to be in reserve, no doubt takes its form so far from the immediate figure of the comet vanishing into the unseen. But the idea expressed is not so much that of suddenness as that of certainty and irreversibility. It is the doom which Christ himself pronounces to be <span class="accented">prepared</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>), and, therefore, inevitable and perpetual. In confirmation of this statement of the certainty of the doom, the readers are next reminded of the Lord's judicial coming, and of that as the subject of prophecy. The prophecy in question, though not one of those recorded in the canonical Hebrew Scriptures, seems to have been familiar enough to the readers to make it a natural and pertinent thing to quote it. So Paul cites heathen authors or common popular sayings in support of his statements. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 False teachers are dreamers; they greatly defile and grievously wound the soul. These teachers are of a disturbed mind and a seditious spirit; forgetting that the powers that be, are ordained of God, Ro 13:1. As to the contest about the body of Moses, it appears that Satan wished to make the place of his burial known to the Israelites, in order to tempt them to worship him, but he was prevented, and vented his rage in desperate blasphemy. This should remind all who dispute never to bring railing charges. Also learn hence, that we ought to defend those whom God owns. It is hard, if not impossible, to find any enemies to the Christian religion, who did not, and do not, live in open or secret contradiction to the principles of natural religion. Such are here compared to brute beasts, though they often boast of themselves as the wisest of mankind. They corrupt themselves in the things most open and plain. The fault lies, not in their understandings, but in their depraved wills, and their disordered appetites and affections. It is a great reproach, though unjust to religion, when those who profess it are opposed to it in heart and life. The Lord will remedy this in his time and way; not in men's blind way of plucking up the wheat with the tares. It is sad when men begin in the Spirit, and end in the flesh. Twice dead; they had been once dead in their natural, fallen state; but now they are dead again by the evident proofs of their hypocrisy. Dead trees, why cumber they the ground! Away with them to the fire. Raging waves are a terror to sailing passengers; but when they get into port, the noise and terror are ended. False teachers are to expect the worst punishments in this world and in that to come. They glare like meteors, or falling stars, and then sink into the blackness of darkness for ever. We have no mention of the prophecy of Enoch in any other part or place of Scripture; yet one plain text of Scripture, proves any point we are to believe. We find from this, that Christ's coming to judge was prophesied of, as early as the times before the flood. The Lord cometh: what a glorious time will that be! Notice how often the word ungodly is repeated. Many now do not at all refer to the terms godly, or ungodly, unless it be to mock at even the words; but it is not so in the language taught us by the Holy Ghost. Hard speeches of one another, especially if ill-grounded, will certainly come into account at the day of judgment. These evil men and seducers are angry at every thing that happens, and never pleased with their own state and condition. Their will and their fancy, are their only rule and law. Those who please their sinful appetites, are most prone to yield to ungovernable passions. The men of God, from the beginning of the world, have declared the doom denounced on them. Such let us avoid. We are to follow men only as they follow Christ.</body></html>
