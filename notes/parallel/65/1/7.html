This example is closely connected with the immediately preceding by the even as with which the verse opens; which phrase expresses a likeness between the two cases, to wit, between the reservation of those angels in bonds for the final judgment, and the fate of those cities as subjects of the penal vengeance of God. Two of those cities of evil memory, <span class="cmt_word">Sodom and Gomorrah,</span> are mentioned by name. The other two, Admah and Zeboim, are included in the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">and the cities about them.</span> Attention is rightly called by some of the commentators to the remarkable frequency with which the case of Sodom and Gomorrah is brought forward, both in the New Testament and in the Old, and to the use which Paul makes of it (as he finds it cited by Isaiah) in the great argument of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>. The sin charged against these cities is stated in express terms to have been the same in kind with that of the angels - the indulgence of passion contrary to nature. They are described as having in <span class="cmt_word">like manner with these</span> (that is, surely, in like manner with these angels just referred to; not, as some strangely imagine, with these men who corrupt the Church) <span class="cmt_word">given themselves over to fornication, and gone after strange flesh.</span> The verbs are selected to bring out the intense sinfulness of the sin - the one being a strong compound form expressing unreserved surrender, the other an equally strong compound form denoting a departure from the law of nature in the impurities practiced. The sin has taken its name from the city with which the Book of Genesis so fearfully connects its indulgence. It forms one of the darkest strokes in the terrible picture which Paul has given us of the state of the ancient heathen world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>). With the Dead Sea probably in his view, the writer describes the doom of the cities as an <span class="accented">example</span> of or a <span class="accented">witness</span> to (the noun used being one that occurs again only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>, and bearing either sense) the retributive justice of God. They are <span class="cmt_word">set forth</span> (literally, <span class="accented">they lie before</span> us) <span class="cmt_word">for an example, suffering the vengeance</span> (rather, <span class="accented">the punishment</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of eternal fire.</span> So it is put by the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, as also by Wickliffe, Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan, and the Rhemish. There is much to be said, however, in favour of the order adopted by the Revised Version in its margin, viz. "set forth as an example of eternal fire, suffering punishment." It could not, except in a forced manner, be said that these cities, in being destroyed as they were, suffered the penalty of <span class="accented">eternal</span> fire, and continued to serve as an instance of that. But it could be said that, in being destroyed, they suffered punishment, and that the kind of punishment was typical of the eternal retribution of God. "A destruction," says Professor Lumby, "so utter and so permanent as theirs has been, is the nearest approach that can be found in this world to the destruction which awaits those who are kept under darkness unto the judgment of the great day." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-7 Outward privileges, profession, and apparent conversion, could not secure those from the vengeance of God, who turned aside in unbelief and disobedience. The destruction of the unbelieving Israelites in the wilderness, shows that none ought to presume on their privileges. They had miracles as their daily bread; yet even they perished in unbelief. A great number of the angels were not pleased with the stations God allotted to them; pride was the main and direct cause or occasion of their fall. The fallen angels are kept to the judgment of the great day; and shall fallen men escape it? Surely not. Consider this in due time. The destruction of Sodom is a loud warning to all, to take heed of, and flee from fleshly lusts that war against the soul,</body></html>
