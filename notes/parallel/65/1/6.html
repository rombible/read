The copula connects it closely with the former, and gives it some emphasis: "angels, too," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, angels not less than the people selected by God to be a people for himself, have been examples of the terrible law of Divine retribution. The particular class of angels are defined as <span class="cmt_word">those who kept not their first estate;</span> or better, <span class="accented">their own principality.</span> The idea conveyed by the term here is that of <span class="accented">lordship</span> rather than <span class="accented">beginning.</span> It is the term which is held by most commentators to be used as a title of angels in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, etc., where mention is made of "principalities." In the present passage Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan and our Authorized Version agree in rendering it "first estate." But the Rhemish gives "principality," and Wickliffe has "princehood." Those seem right, therefore, who take the reference to be to the Jewish idea of a peculiar dignity or lordship held by the angels in creation. The sin alleged as the reason for the penalty which the writer recalls to the minds of his readers is that they failed to keep this lordship, and <span class="cmt_word">left their proper habitation;</span> by which latter clause a descent to a different sphere of being is intended. The penalty itself is this - that God <span class="cmt_word">hath kept them in everlasting chains</span> (or, <span class="accented">bonds</span>, with the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</span> It is well to retain the rendering "kept" in this clause, instead of the "reserved" of the Authorized Version. For the verb used in describing the sin and that used in describing the penalty are the same. As they "kept not their lordship," God has <span class="accented">"kept</span> them in everlasting bonds." The word by which the idea of the <span class="accented">everlasting</span> is expressed is a peculiarly strong one, occurring only once again in the New Testament, viz. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where it is applied to God's <span class="accented">"eternal</span> power." It designates these bonds as bonds from which there never can be escape. The <span class="accented">place</span> of this present penal detention is declared to be "under darkness." The term selected for the <span class="accented">darkness</span>, again, is an unusual one, occurring only here, in verse 13, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4, 17</a>, and possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18</a>. It means the densest, blackest darkness, and is used both in Homer and in the apocryphal literature (Wisd. 17:2) of the darkness of the nether world. This darkness, as Dean Alford observes, is "considered as brooding over them, and they under it." But this present penal detention is itself the prelude to a still more awful doom - "the judgment of the great day" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>). There is a similar, but less definite, statement on the subject of angelic sin and penalty in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>. But these representations differ greatly from others (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>), where the air or the heavenly places appear as the scenes occupied by evil spirits, and these spirits possess freedom. In the New Testament, indeed, there are no passages, except those in Peter and Jude, which speak of fallen angels as at present in bonds. Even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>, the statement is of a fate <span class="accented">prepared</span>, and nothing more. The difference in the two representations is due probably to a difference in the subjects. Other passages refer to the devil and his angels. But in the present passage there is nothing to indicate that the fall of Satan is in view. The sin suggested by the context is not the sin of pride, but a sin against nature. The reference, therefore, is taken to be to the Jewish idea that amatory passion is not limited to the creatures of earth, and that some angels, yielding to the spell of the beauty of the daughters of men, forsook their own kingdom, and entered unto unnatural relations with them. The Jewish belief is seen in the story of Asmodeus in the Book of Tobit; it is found by Josephus (who has been followed by not a few modern interpreters) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1-4</a>; and it is given with special distinctness in the Book of Enoch. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:5-7 Outward privileges, profession, and apparent conversion, could not secure those from the vengeance of God, who turned aside in unbelief and disobedience. The destruction of the unbelieving Israelites in the wilderness, shows that none ought to presume on their privileges. They had miracles as their daily bread; yet even they perished in unbelief. A great number of the angels were not pleased with the stations God allotted to them; pride was the main and direct cause or occasion of their fall. The fallen angels are kept to the judgment of the great day; and shall fallen men escape it? Surely not. Consider this in due time. The destruction of Sodom is a loud warning to all, to take heed of, and flee from fleshly lusts that war against the soul,</body></html>
