We cannot get beyond a conjectural explanation of these phenomena, but it is possible that, as a matter of fact, he simply did not learn these facts in the course of his inquiries, and therefore did not insert them. As far as it goes, the fact suggests the inference that he had not seen the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark in the form in which we now have them. On the narrative that follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?">Luke 9:18-27</a>), see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-13.htm" title="When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?">Matthew 16:13-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-27.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Whom do men say that I am?">Mark 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-1.htm" title="And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.">Mark 9:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As he was alone praying.</span>--There is, as before (see <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> and Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-21.htm" title="Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,">Luke 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-16.htm" title="And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.">Luke 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12</a>), something characteristic in the stress which St. Luke lays on the fact. It is as though he saw in what follows the result of the previous prayer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-27.</span> <span class="accented">- Jesus</span> <span class="accented">question to his own</span>: <span class="accented">Who did they think he was</span>? <span class="accented">He tells them of a suffering Messiah</span>, <span class="accented">and describes the lot of his own true followers.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</span> With these abrupt words, St. Luke changes for his readers the time and scene. Since the miracle of feeding the five thousand at Bethsaida Julias, Jesus had preached at Capernaum the famous sermon on the "Bread of life" (reported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.); he had wandered to the north-east as far as the maritime cities of Tyro and Sidon; had returned again to the Decapolis region for a brief sojourn; and then once more had turned his footsteps north; and it was in the extreme confines of the Holy Land, in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, and close to the great fountain, the source of the sacred Jordan, at the foot of the southern ridge of Hermon, where he put the momentous question here chronicled, to his listening disciples. Much had happened since the five thousand were fed. The defection which the Master had foreseen when he commenced his parable-teaching with the sad story of the "sower," had begun. After the great Capernaum sermon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.), many had fallen away from him; the enthusiasm for his words was rapidly waning; the end was already in sight. "Well," he asks his own, "what are men saying about me? Whom do they think that I am?" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:18-27 It is an unspeakable comfort that our Lord Jesus is God's Anointed; this signifies that he was both appointed to be the Messiah, and qualified for it. Jesus discourses concerning his own sufferings and death. And so far must his disciples be from thinking how to prevent his sufferings, that they must prepare for their own. We often meet with crosses in the way of duty; and though we must not pull them upon our own heads, yet, when they are laid for us, we must take them up, and carry them after Christ. It is well or ill with us, according as it is well or ill with our souls. The body cannot be happy, if the soul be miserable in the other world; but the soul may be happy, though the body is greatly afflicted and oppressed in this world. We must never be ashamed of Christ and his gospel.</body></html>
