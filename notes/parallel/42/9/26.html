Here follows the punishment in the world to come. It consists in the Judge's solemn award to the man who has succeeded in saving his life in this world. The award is, "Depart from me: I know you not." Of such a selfish soul, who here has loved his own ease, and has declined all self-sacrifice, will the Son of man, in the day of his glory, be justly ashamed. The suffering Messiah thus completed his vivid picture of himself. Not always was he to suffer, or to wear the robe of humiliation. The Despised and Rejected would assuredly return with a glory indescribable, inconceivable. His assertion, advanced here, that <span class="accented">he</span> will return as Almighty Judge, is very remarkable. In the parallel passage in St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>) it is put even more clearly. There Jesus asks his disciples, "Whom do men say that <span class="accented">I</span>, <span class="accented">the Son of man</span>, am?" In ver. 27 Jesus goes on to say, "The <span class="accented">Son of man</span> shall come in the glory of <span class="accented">his</span> Father, with <span class="accented">his</span> angels, and then <span class="accented">he</span> shall reward every man according to his works." The lesson was very clear. His own might surely be content. Only let them be patient. Lo! in <span class="accented">the</span> poor rejected Rabbi now before them, going to his bitter suffering and his death, they were looking really on the awful form of the Almighty Judge of quick and dead. These words, very dimly understood <span class="accented">then</span>, in days to come were often recalled by his hearers. They formed the groundwork of many a primitive apostolic sermon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:18-27 It is an unspeakable comfort that our Lord Jesus is God's Anointed; this signifies that he was both appointed to be the Messiah, and qualified for it. Jesus discourses concerning his own sufferings and death. And so far must his disciples be from thinking how to prevent his sufferings, that they must prepare for their own. We often meet with crosses in the way of duty; and though we must not pull them upon our own heads, yet, when they are laid for us, we must take them up, and carry them after Christ. It is well or ill with us, according as it is well or ill with our souls. The body cannot be happy, if the soul be miserable in the other world; but the soul may be happy, though the body is greatly afflicted and oppressed in this world. We must never be ashamed of Christ and his gospel.</body></html>
