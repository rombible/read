Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2</a>. The former word includes the "piazza" or "place" of an Eastern town; the latter is the long, narrow "street" or "lane" hardly wide enough for a man to ride through. It is the word used for the "street called straight" in Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-11.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,">Acts 9:11</a>). In the application of the parable these represent the by-ways of Jewish life--the suburbs, and the wretched courts and alleys, which no scribe deigned to enter, and which lay entirely outside the notice and the functions of the priesthood. "The poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind" are the publicans and sinners and harlots and men of violence, who obeyed the summons and pressed eagerly into the kingdom. The repetition of the same four adjectives as had been used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-13.htm" title="But when you make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:">Luke 14:13</a> is singularly suggestive. Our Lord was following, in the spiritual feast of His kingdom, the very rule which He had given for those who made great feasts on earth. Each class may possibly represent some spiritual fact which would seem to men a disqualification, but which was, for the pitying love of Christ, the very ground of invitation and acceptance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind</span>. The invitations to the great feast, seeing that those first bidden were indifferent, were then sent out far and wide - through broad streets and narrow lanes, among wealthy publicans (tax-collectors) and poor artisans. The invitations were distributed broadcast among a rougher and less cultured class, but still the invitations to the banquet were confined to dwellers in the <span class="accented">city</span>; we hear as yet of no going <span class="accented">without the walls.</span> Here the invitation seems generally to have been accepted. All this in the first instance referred to the Galilaean peasants, to the Jewish publicans, to the mass of the people, who heard him, on the whole, gladly. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:15-24 In this parable observe the free grace and mercy of God shining in the gospel of Christ, which will be food and a feast for the soul of a man that knows its own wants and miseries. All found some pretence to put off their attendance. This reproves the Jewish nation for their neglect of the offers of Christ's grace. It shows also the backwardness there is to close with the gospel call. The want of gratitude in those who slight gospel offers, and the contempt put upon the God of heaven thereby, justly provoke him. The apostles were to turn to the Gentiles, when the Jews refused the offer; and with them the church was filled. The provision made for precious souls in the gospel of Christ, has not been made in vain; for if some reject, others will thankfully accept the offer. The very poor and low in the world, shall be as welcome to Christ as the rich and great; and many times the gospel has the greatest success among those that labour under worldly disadvantages and bodily infirmities. Christ's house shall at last be filled; it will be so when the number of the elect is completed.</body></html>
