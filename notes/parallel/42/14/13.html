Relief given privately, thoughtfully, discriminatively, may be better both for the giver, as less ostentatious, and for the receivers, as tending to the formation of a higher character, than the open feast of the Eastern form of benevolence. The essence of the beatitude, as distinct from its form, remains for all who give freely to those who can give them no recompense in return, who have nothing to offer but their thanks and prayers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee.</span> Great pagan moralists, sick at heart at these dreary, selfish society conventionalities, have condemned this system of entertaining those who would be likely to make an equivalent return for the interested hospitality. So Martial, writing of such an incident, says, 'You are asking for gifts, Sextus, not for friends." Nehemiah gives a somewhat similar charge to the Jews of his day: "Eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just</span>. There is no doubt that Jesus here was alluding to that first resurrection which would consist of the "just" only; of that which St. John speaks of in rapt and glowing terms: "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>). This was a doctrine evidently much insisted on by the early teachers of Christianity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-15.htm">Acts 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11</a>; and compare our Lord's words again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:7-14 Even in the common actions of life, Christ marks what we do, not only in our religious assemblies, but at our tables. We see in many cases, that a man's pride will bring him low, and before honour is humility. Our Saviour here teaches, that works of charity are better than works of show. But our Lord did not mean that a proud and unbelieving liberality should be rewarded, but that his precept of doing good to the poor and afflicted should be observed from love to him.</body></html>
