The man was either a "ruler" in the same sense as Nicodemus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-1.htm" title="There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:">John 3:1</a>), or the rich young man in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-18.htm" title="And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 18:18</a> - i.e., a member of the Sanhedrin (which seems most likely)--or else occupied a high position in the lay-hierarchy (if the phrase may be allowed) which had developed itself in the organisation of Pharisaism.<p><span class= "bld">To eat bread on the Sabbath day.</span>--Sabbath feasts were then, as at a later time, part of the social life of the Jews, and were often--subject, of course, to the condition that the food was cold--occasions of great luxury and display. Augustine speaks of them as including dancing and song, and the "Sabbath luxury" of the Jews became a proverb. On the motives of the Pharisee--probably half respect and half curiosity--see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-36.htm" title="And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.">Luke 7:36</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <span class="accented">The Pharisee's feast on a sabbath day.

Still on the same journey; the Lord was approaching gradually nearer Jerusalem. The house into which he entered this sabbath belonged to one who was a leading member of the Pharisee party, probably an influential rabbi, a man of great wealth, or a member of the Sanhedrim "To eat bread on the sabbath day," as a guest, was a usual practice; such entertainments on the sabbath day were very usual; they were often luxurious and costly. The only rule observed was that all the viands provided were cold,, everything having been cooked on a previous day. Augustine alludes to these sabbath feasts as including at times singing and dancing. <span class="cmt_word">They watched him</span>. This explains the reason of the invitation to the great Teacher, on the part of a leading Pharisee, after the Master's bitter denunciation of the party (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-39.htm">Luke 11:39-52</a>). The feast and its attendant circumstances were all arranged, and Jesus' watchful enemies waited to see what he would do. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-6 This Pharisee, as well as others, seems to have had an ill design in entertaining Jesus at his house. But our Lord would not be hindered from healing a man, though he knew a clamour would be raised at his doing it on the sabbath. It requires care to understand the proper connexion between piety and charity in observing the sabbath, and the distinction between works of real necessity and habits of self-indulgence. Wisdom from above, teaches patient perseverance in well-doing.</body></html>
