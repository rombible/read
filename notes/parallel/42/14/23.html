For the most part, these were low walls or palisades, rather than hedges in the English sense of the word. In the application of the parable, the men thus brought in can hardly be any other than the wanderers of the outlying Gentile world.<p><span class= "bld">Compel them to come in.</span>--It would have seemed all but incredible, had it not been too painfully and conspicuously true, that men could have seen in these words a sanction to the employment of force and pains and penalties as means of converting men to the faith of Christ. To us it seems almost a truism to say that such means may produce proselytes and hypocrites, but cannot possibly produce converts. There is, of course, something that answers to this "compulsion" in the work of Christian preachers, but the weapons of their warfare are not carnal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)">2Corinthians 10:4</a>), and the constraint which they bring to bear on men is that of "the love of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm" title="For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:">2Corinthians 5:14</a>) The only instances of the other kind of compulsion in the Apostolic age are when Saul "compelled" men and women to blaspheme (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-11.htm" title="And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to strange cities.">Acts 26:11</a>), or the Judaisers "compelled" Gentile converts to be circumcised (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-14.htm" title="But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?">Galatians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm" title="As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.">Galatians 6:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That my house may be filled.</span>--It is obvious that we cannot introduce space-limits into the interpretation of the parable. The gates of the Father's house are open for evermore, and in its "many mansions" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm" title="In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.">John 14:2</a>) there is, and ever will be, room for all who come.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges</span>. Hitherto the parable-story has been dealing with the past and the present of Israel; it now becomes prophetic, and speaks of a state of things to be. The third series of invitations is not addressed to inhabitants of a city. No walls hem in these far-scattered dwellers among the highways and hedges of the world. This time the master of the house asks to his great banquet those who live in the isles of the Gentiles<span class="cmt_word">. And compel them to some in</span>. A greater pressure is put on <span class="accented">this</span> class of outsiders than was tried upon the favoured first invited. The indifferent ones were left to themselves. <span class="accented">They</span> knew, or professed to know and to appreciate, the nature of that feast in heaven, the invitation to which they treated <span class="accented">apparently</span> with so much honour, and <span class="accented">really</span> with such contempt. But these outsiders the Divine Host would treat differently. To them the notion of a pitying, loving God was quite a strange thought; <span class="accented">these</span> must be compelled - must be brought to him with the gentle force which the angels used when they laid hold of the hand of lingering Lot, and brought him out of the doomed city of the plain. Thus faithful men, intensely convinced of the truth of their message, <span class="accented">compel</span> others, by the bright earnestness of their words and life, to join the company of those who are going up to the feast above. Anselm thinks that God may be also said to <span class="accented">compel</span> men to come in when he drives them by calamities to seek and find refuge with him and in his Church. <span class="cmt_word">That my house may be filled</span>. In ver. 22 the servant, who knew well his master's mind and his master's house too, and its capabilities, tells his lord how, after many had accepted the invitation and were gone in to the banquet, "yet there was room." The master of the house, approving his servant's words, confirms them by repeating, "Bring in more andyet more, that my house may be filled." Bengel comments here with his quaint grace in words to which no translation can do justice: "Nee natura nec gratis patitur vacuum." Our God, with his burning love for souls, will never bear to contemplate a half-empty heaven. "Messiah will see of the travail of his soul, and be satisfied." "The love of God," says Godet, "is great; it requires a multitude of guests; it will not have a seat empty. The number of the elect is, as it were, determined beforehand by the riches of the Divine glory, which cannot find complete reflection without a certain number of human beings. The invitation will, therefore, be continued, and consequently the history of our race prolonged, until that number be reached." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:15-24 In this parable observe the free grace and mercy of God shining in the gospel of Christ, which will be food and a feast for the soul of a man that knows its own wants and miseries. All found some pretence to put off their attendance. This reproves the Jewish nation for their neglect of the offers of Christ's grace. It shows also the backwardness there is to close with the gospel call. The want of gratitude in those who slight gospel offers, and the contempt put upon the God of heaven thereby, justly provoke him. The apostles were to turn to the Gentiles, when the Jews refused the offer; and with them the church was filled. The provision made for precious souls in the gospel of Christ, has not been made in vain; for if some reject, others will thankfully accept the offer. The very poor and low in the world, shall be as welcome to Christ as the rich and great; and many times the gospel has the greatest success among those that labour under worldly disadvantages and bodily infirmities. Christ's house shall at last be filled; it will be so when the number of the elect is completed.</body></html>
