St. Luke's anticipation of the close of the Baptist's history supplies a curious instance of an arrangement which was obviously deliberate. It seemed to him better to complete the account of the Baptist's ministry here than to bring in the account of the imprisonment as an episode later on. It coincides in part with St. John's arrangement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-24.htm" title="For John was not yet cast into prison.">John 3:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For all the evils which Herod had done.</span>--The marriage with Herodias is conspicuous as the Tetrarch's one great crime; but the sensual, crafty character of the man, with his fox-like nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-32.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.">Luke 13:32</a>), must have made any preaching of "righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come" as much a personal rebuke to him as it was to Felix (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-25.htm" title="And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.">Acts 24:25</a>), and caused him also to tremble.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:15-20 John the Baptist disowned being himself the Christ, but confirmed the people in their expectations of the long-promised Messiah. He could only exhort them to repent, and assure them of forgiveness upon repentance; but he could not work repentance in them, nor confer remission on them. Thus highly does it become us to speak of Christ, and thus humbly of ourselves. John can do no more than baptize with water, in token that they ought to purify and cleanse themselves; but Christ can, and will baptize with the Holy Ghost; he can give the Spirit, to cleanse and purify the heart, not only as water washes off the dirt on the outside, but as fire clears out the dross that is within, and melts down the metal, that it may be cast into a new mould. John was an affectionate preacher; he was beseeching; he pressed things home upon his hearers. He was a practical preacher; quickening them to their duty, and directing them in it. He was a popular preacher; he addressed the people, according to their capacity. He was an evangelical preacher. In all his exhortations, he directed people to Christ. When we press duty upon people, we must direct them to Christ, both for righteousness and strength. He was a copious preacher; he shunned not to declare the whole counsel of God. But a full stop was put to John's preaching when he was in the midst of his usefulness. Herod being reproved by him for many evils, shut up John in prison. Those who injure the faithful servants of God, add still greater guilt to their other sins.</body></html>
