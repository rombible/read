(See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) The familiar tone, as of one appealing to each man's natural good-will, and the dramatic vividness of the dialogue, make it almost unique in our Lord's teaching. "Midnight" is chosen as being the time at which, above all others, men expect to be left to their repose. The unexpected visitor asks for "three loaves," one for himself, one for the guest, one as a reserve; and he so far trusts his friend as to hope that he will recognise the claims of his friendship for another. So, the implied lesson is, should the man who prays think that God will care for those for whom he pleads, and will give them also their "daily bread" in both the higher and the lower senses of the word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-13.</span> - <span class="accented">Prayer continued. The wisdom of perseverance in prayer is pressed. The Lord introduces his argument by the short parable of the selfish neighbor.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend,</span> <span class="cmt_word">lend me three loaves.</span> This whole passage follows naturally the Lord's own formula of prayer. The teaching contained in vers. 1-13 may be well summarized as the Master's <span class="accented">lesson on prayer.</span> The disciples, when they heard Jesus pray, asked him to instruct them in the holy art. The Lord then suggested to them a series of short <span class="accented">subjects</span> for constant prayer, and further gave them <span class="accented">words</span> in which they could embody these subjects, and then proceeded to press upon them that this constant seeking help from God should never be interrupted; no discouragements were ever to prevent their praying. "See," said the Master, "this" (telling them the little parable) "is what God appears to be when prayer receives no answer." Of course, he is not what he appears to be (see ver. 9). The truth concerning <span class="accented">God</span> does not really come out before the words of ver. 9; but the parable, grotesque and quaint, and picturing a common scene of everyday life, arrested the attention <span class="accented">then</span> as it has done in many a million cases since, and told men out of heart and despairing of receiving any answer to their prayers, to think. Well, here is a case in point; but is God like this? The Lord replies shortly to this mute heart-query. <span class="accented">At midnight.</span> The whole picture is drawn from a poor man's house - children and parents sleeping in one room. "With me in bed" probably suggests what is common in an Eastern house, where a divan or raised platform (rendered here "bed") often filled well-nigh half the room. The hour <span class="accented">midnight</span> has nothing strained in it - it was frequently the practice in the East to travel by night, and so to escape the great heat of the day. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:5-13 Christ encourages fervency and constancy in prayer. We must come for what we need, as a man does to his neighbour or friend, who is kind to him. We must come for bread; for that which is needful. If God does not answer our prayers speedily, yet he will in due time, if we continue to pray. Observe what to pray for; we must ask for the Holy Spirit, not only as necessary in order to our praying well, but as all spiritual blessings are included in that one. For by the influences of the Holy Spirit we are brought to know God and ourselves, to repent, believe in, and love Christ, and so are made comfortable in this world, and meet for happiness in the next. All these blessings our heavenly Father is more ready to bestow on every one that asks for them, than an indulgent parent is to give food to a hungry child. And this is the advantage of the prayer of faith, that it quiets and establishes the heart in God.</body></html>
