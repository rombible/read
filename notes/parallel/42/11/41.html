In the underlying principle of its teaching it sweeps away the whole fabric of the law of ceremonial purity, as the words of St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-10.htm" title="And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:">Matthew 15:10-20</a> had, on different grounds, done before. The distinction between the two phases of the truth is that here greater stress is laid on the active purifying power of the love of which alms, if not given for the sake of man's praise, is the natural expression. That which defiles is selfishness; that which purifies is the unselfishness of love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you</span>. The translation here should run, <span class="accented">but rather give the things that are in them as alms</span>, etc. The thought of the <span class="accented">contents</span> of these cups and dishes - a thought which came out, as we have seen, so prominently in St. Matthew - here is evidently in the Lord's mind. "Ah!" he seems to say, "what you Pharisees and your schools of formalism indeed want is the knowledge of that great law of love" (the law Jesus was ever teaching in such parables, for instance, as that of the good Samaritan). "I will tell you how really to purify, in the eyes of God, these cups and dishes of yours. <span class="accented">Share their contents with your poorer neighbors."</span> "Let them do one single loving, unselfish act, not for the sake of the action itself, not for any merit inherent in it; but out of pure good will towards others, and their whole inward condition would be different" (Bishop Basil Jones, in the 'Speaker's Commentary'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:37-54 We should all look to our hearts, that they may be cleansed and new-created; and while we attend to the great things of the law and of the gospel, we must not neglect the smallest matter God has appointed. When any wait to catch something out of our mouths, that they may insnare us, O Lord, give us thy prudence and thy patience, and disappoint their evil purposes. Furnish us with such meekness and patience that we may glory in reproaches, for Christ's sake, and that thy Holy Spirit may rest upon us.</body></html>
