That which had been given to the multitude was enough for them. If they wanted to be taught to pray at all, if earnest desires did not spontaneously clothe themselves in words, then this simplest and shortest of all prayers expressed all that they should seek to ask. To utter each of those petitions from the heart, entering into its depth and fulness, was better than to indulge in any amplitude of rhetoric.<p>(2-4) <span class= "bld">Our Father which art in heaven.</span>--See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/6-9.htm" title="After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.">Matthew 6:9-11</a>. The following variations may be noticed. (1) The better MSS. omit "our" and "which art in heaven," and begin with the simple "Father." It was, of course, natural enough that it should be, in course of time, adapted by transcribers to the form which was in common use. (2) Many of the best MSS., again, omit the whole clause, "Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth," which may have been inserted with the same purpose. (3) St. Luke substitutes "day by day" for "this day," and so implies that the word <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span> (<span class= "ital">epiousios</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> translated "daily," must have some other meaning. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus II. on Notes to St. Matthew.</span>) (4) St. Luke uses the word "sins" instead of "debts," as being, perhaps, more adapted to the minds of his Gentile readers, while he retains the primary idea of St. Matthew's term in the words, "every one that is indebted to us." The familiar "Forgive us our trespasses," of the Prayer Book, it may be noted, is not found in the Authorised version at all, and comes to us from Tyndale's. (5) Many of the better MSS. omit the clause, "But deliver us from evil," this too, probably, being an addition made for the sake of conformity. (6) St. Luke (all the MSS. here agreeing) omits the final doxology found in some, but not in the best, MSS. of St. Matthew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, When ye pray, say</span>. The older authorities leave out the clauses erased. The prayer, as originally reported by St. Luke, no doubt stood as follows. The erased clauses were filled in by early scribes from the longer formula supplied by St. Matthew, and spoken at an earlier period by the Master: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"Our Father which, art in heaven, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hallowed be thy Name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thy kingdom come. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Give us day by day our daily bread. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And forgive us our sins; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>for we also forgive every one <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>that is indebted to us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And lead us not into temptation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>but deliver us from evil." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It has been said that our Lord has derived from the Talmud the thoughts embodied in this prayer. If this could be shown to be the case, it would in no way detract from its admitted value and beauty. Indeed, the earthly training of Jesus would naturally lead him to make use of whatever was true and practical in the teaching of the schools of his people. There is no doubt that in the New Testament many a gem of exquisite beauty could be found, drawn from that strange, weird Talmud, where the highest wisdom is mingled with the wildest errors and conceits. But in the matter of the "Lord's Prayer," it must be borne in mind that only a comparatively small portion of its thoughts can be traced to Talmudical sources, and there can be no positive certainty as to their priority, since the Mishna was not committed to writing before the second century of the Christian era, and the Gemara later still. The Lord's Prayer, in the report of St. Luke, contains five petitions. Two have reference to the love of God, and three to human needs. <span class="cmt_word">Our Father which art in heaven</span>. It was not now uncommon in Jewish liturgies and prayers to invoke the Eternal of Israel under the dear name of "Father." "Thou, O Lord, art our Father." <span class="cmt_word">Hallowed be thy Name</span>. Not only do we pray that the Name of God may be to us a sacred precious thing, not lightly used in trivial speech, still less in bitterness and anger, only in holy reverent prayer; but we include in these words a prayer, too, that tho our <span class="accented">thoughts</span> of God may be pure, lofty, holy. <span class="cmt_word">Thy kingdom come</span>. No Messianic kingdom, in the old Jewish meaning of the word, is signified here. It is a far onlook to the close of this dispensation, which close, we believe, is hindered by human sin and perversity. It is the prayer for the end, when there will be no more tears and partings, no more sorrow and sin. It tells of the same feeling which John, at the close of the Revelation, expressed in "Even so, come, Lord Jesus." Instead of these words, Gregory of Nyssa, in his manuscript of St. Luke, appears to have read, "Thy Holy Spirit come upon us, and purify us." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-4 Lord, teach us to pray, is a good prayer, and a very needful one, for Jesus Christ only can teach us, by his word and Spirit, how to pray. Lord, teach me what it is to pray; Lord, stir up and quicken me to the duty; Lord, direct me what to pray for; teach me what I should say. Christ taught them a prayer, much the same that he had given before in his sermon upon the mount. There are some differences in the words of the Lord's prayer in Matthew and in Luke, but they are of no moment. Let us in our requests, both for others and for ourselves, come to our heavenly Father, confiding in his power and goodness.</body></html>
