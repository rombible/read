It seems, indeed, to have been purposely so stated that it could only suggest an <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> argument. Thus man might answer, but so does not God. If prayer prevails over apathy and impatience, how much more will it prevail when we pray to One who knows our necessities before we ask Him? The picture drawn is obviously from a poor man's house, children and parents sleeping in the same room, the younger children (the Greek word is a diminutive) in the same bed. The word here, however, differs from the other two commonly translated "bed" (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins be forgiven you.">Matthew 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.">Matthew 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-4.htm" title="And when they could not come near to him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.">Mark 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-9.htm" title="Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?">Mark 2:9</a>), and probably means the <span class= "ital">divan</span> or raised platform, which often filled nearly half a room in a Jewish or Eastern house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:5-13 Christ encourages fervency and constancy in prayer. We must come for what we need, as a man does to his neighbour or friend, who is kind to him. We must come for bread; for that which is needful. If God does not answer our prayers speedily, yet he will in due time, if we continue to pray. Observe what to pray for; we must ask for the Holy Spirit, not only as necessary in order to our praying well, but as all spiritual blessings are included in that one. For by the influences of the Holy Spirit we are brought to know God and ourselves, to repent, believe in, and love Christ, and so are made comfortable in this world, and meet for happiness in the next. All these blessings our heavenly Father is more ready to bestow on every one that asks for them, than an indulgent parent is to give food to a hungry child. And this is the advantage of the prayer of faith, that it quiets and establishes the heart in God.</body></html>
