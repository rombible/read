The obedience had all along been servile, prompted by fear and hope, even as the slave's obedience is. The language put into the mouth of the elder son is clearly meant to represent the habitual thoughts of the Pharisees. They are taken, as it were, after our Lord's manner, as seen in the previous parables, at their own valuation of themselves. They are conscious of no transgressions; but in that very unconsciousness lies the secret of the absence of any sense of joy in being forgiven, of any power to sympathise with the joy of others, even of any satisfaction in the service in which they pride themselves. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/7-47.htm" title="Why I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.">Luke 7:47-50</a>.) They are scandalised at the gladness which others feel when a penitent returns to God. It seems like an insult and wrong to themselves. Their life has been one of uniform obedience; they have performed their religious duties. Why is so much stir made about those who have fallen as they never fell?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, these many years do I serve thee</span>. Bengel quaintly comments here, "Serous erat." This was the true nature of this later Jewish service of the Eternal. To them the eternal God was simply a Master. They were <span class="accented">slaves</span> who had a hard and difficult task to perform, and for which they looked for a definite payment. <span class="cmt_word">Neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment.</span> We have here reproduced the spirit, almost the very words, of the well-known answer of the young man in the gospel story, who was no doubt a promising scion of the Pharisee party: "All these things have I kept from my youth up." The same thought was in the mind, too, of him who thus prayed in the temple: "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yet thou never gavest me a kid... All that I have is thine</span>. Thy brother has the shoes, the ring, the robe, the banquet; thou the <span class="accented">inheritance</span>, for all that I have is thine. Why grudge to thy brother an hour of the gladness which has been thine these many years? <span class="cmt_word">As soon as this thy son was come,... For this thy brother was dead.</span> The angry elder son will not even acknowledge the prodigal as <span class="accented">his</span> brother; with bitter scorn and some disrespect he speaks of him to his father as "thy son." The father throughout the scene is never incensed. He pleads rather than reproaches, and to this insolence he simply retorts, "Thy brother was dead to us, but now - <span class="cmt_word">It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad</span>." What was the end of this strange scene? The last words, breathing forgiveness and joy, leave a sweet sense of hope upon the reader that all would yet be well in that divided household, and that the brothers, friends again, would clasp hands before the loving father's eyes. But when Jesus told the parable to the crowds, the story was not yet played out. It depended on the Pharisees and rulers how the scene was to end. What happened at Jerusalem a <span class="accented">few weeks later</span>, when the Passion-drama was acted, and some <span class="accented">forty years later</span>, when the city was sacked, tells <span class="accented">us</span> something of what subsequently happened to the elder son of the Lord's parable. But the end has yet to come. We shall yet see the brothers, Jew and Gentile, clasp hands in loving friendship before the father, when the long-lost elder son comes home. There will be joy then indeed in the presence of the angels of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:25-32 In the latter part of this parable we have the character of the Pharisees, though not of them alone. It sets forth the kindness of the Lord, and the proud manner in which his gracious kindness is often received. The Jews, in general, showed the same spirit towards the converted Gentiles; and numbers in every age object to the gospel and its preachers, on the same ground. What must that temper be, which stirs up a man to despise and abhor those for whom the Saviour shed his precious blood, who are objects of the Father's choice, and temples of the Holy Ghost! This springs from pride, self-preference, and ignorance of a man's own heart. The mercy and grace of our God in Christ, shine almost as bright in his tender and gentle bearing with peevish saints, as his receiving prodigal sinners upon their repentance. It is the unspeakable happiness of all the children of God, who keep close to their Father's house, that they are, and shall be ever with him. Happy will it be for those who thankfully accept Christ's invitation.</body></html>
