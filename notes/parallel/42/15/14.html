The famine which "came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a>) was more extensive and memorable than others, but it was far from standing alone. And now the pinch came. His treasure was gone, and for the fulness of bread there was hunger and "cleanness of teeth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-6.htm" title="And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:6</a>). In the individual interpretation of the parable, the mighty famine is the yearning of the soul's unsatisfied desire, the absence of its true food, of "the bread that cometh down from heaven." (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>.) In its wider range it is the craving of humanity for what it cannot find when appetites are not satisfied, and their wonted supply ceases--the famine, not of bread and of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-11.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:">Amos 8:11</a>); the want of a message from the Eternal Father to sustain the life of His children.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had spent all.</span> True of many a soul in all times, but especially in that age of excessive luxury and splendour and of unbridled passions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"On that hard Roman world, disgust<br />And secret loathing fell;<br />Deep weariness and sated lust<br />Made human life a hell."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Matthew Arnold.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">There arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want</span>. The "mighty famine" may be understood to represent difficult times. Wax or political convulsions, so common in those days, may have speedily brought about the ruin of many like the prodigal of our story, and his comparatively small fortune would quickly have been swallowed up. Selfish evil-living, excesses of various kinds, had gained him no real friends, but had left him to meet the ruin of his fortune with enfeebled powers, homeless and friendless; hence the depth of the degradation in which we speedily find him. Not an unusual figure in the great world-drama, this of the younger son - the man who had sacrificed everything for selfish pleasure, and soon found he had absolutely nothing left but suffering. Very touchingly the greatest, perhaps, of our English poets writes of this awful soul-famine. In <span class="accented">his</span> case fortune and rank still remained to him, but everything that can really make life precious and beautiful had been wasted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"My days are in the yellow leaf;<br />The flowers and fruits of love are gone;<br />The worm, the anguish, and the grief,<br />Are mine alone.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The fire that on my bosom preys<br />Is lone as some volcanic isle;<br />No torch is kindled at its blaze -<br />A funeral pile!"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Byron.</span>) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:11-16 The parable of the prodigal son shows the nature of repentance, and the Lord's readiness to welcome and bless all who return to him. It fully sets forth the riches of gospel grace; and it has been, and will be, while the world stands, of unspeakable use to poor sinners, to direct and to encourage them in repenting and returning to God. It is bad, and the beginning of worse, when men look upon God's gifts as debts due to them. The great folly of sinners, and that which ruins them, is, being content in their life-time to receive their good things. Our first parents ruined themselves and all their race, by a foolish ambition to be independent, and this is at the bottom of sinners' persisting in their sin. We may all discern some features of our own characters in that of the prodigal son. A sinful state is of departure and distance from God. A sinful state is a spending state: wilful sinners misemploy their thoughts and the powers of their souls, mispend their time and all their opportunities. A sinful state is a wanting state. Sinners want necessaries for their souls; they have neither food nor raiment for them, nor any provision for hereafter. A sinful state is a vile, slavish state. The business of the devil's servants is to make provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof, and that is no better than feeding swine. A sinful state is a state constant discontent. The wealth of the world and the pleasures of the senses will not even satisfy our bodies; but what are they to precious souls! A sinful state is a state which cannot look for relief from any creature. In vain do we cry to the world and to the flesh; they have that which will poison a soul, but have nothing to give which will feed and nourish it. A sinful state is a state of death. A sinner is dead in trespasses and sins, destitute of spiritual life. A sinful state is a lost state. Souls that are separated from God, if his mercy prevent not, will soon be lost for ever. The prodigal's wretched state, only faintly shadows forth the awful ruin of man by sin. Yet how few are sensible of their own state and character!</body></html>
