The use of a like word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-42.htm" title="And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?">Luke 12:42</a> suggests that this also may have passed from the abstract to the concrete sense, and have been used for a <span class= "ital">household</span> of many servants as well as for the act of serving.<p><span class= "bld">Came to him.</span>--The Greek word implies something like a hasty movement to interrupt the calm tenor of the Lord's discourse. The hasty vehement complaint that follows is quite in keeping with this.<p><span class= "bld">That she help me.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">that she join in helping.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Came to him</span>. Dr. Farrar very happily seizes the tone and temper of Martha. He renders the Greek words here, "but suddenly coming up." We see in this inimitable touch the little petulant outburst of jealousy in the loving, busy matron, as she hurried in with the words, "Why is Mary sitting there doing nothing?" <span class="cmt_word">Bid her therefore that she help me</span>. "We almost seem to hear the undertone of 'It is no use for <span class="accented">me</span> to tell her.' Doubtless, had she been less' fretted,' she would have felt that to leave her (Martha) alone and withdraw into the background while this eager hospitality was going on, was the kindest and most unselfish thing which Mary could do." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:38-42 A good sermon is not the worse for being preached in a house; and the visits of our friends should be so managed, as to make them turn to the good of their souls. Sitting at Christ's feet, signifies readiness to receive his word, and submission to the guidance of it. Martha was providing for the entertainment of Christ, and those that came with him. Here were respect to our Lord Jesus and right care of her household affairs. But there was something to be blamed. She was for much serving; plenty, variety, and exactness. Worldly business is a snare to us, when it hinders us from serving God, and getting good to our souls. What needless time is wasted, and expense often laid out, even in entertaining professors of the gospel! Though Martha was on this occasion faulty, yet she was a true believer, and in her general conduct did not neglect the one thing needful. The favour of God is needful to our happiness; the salvation of Christ is needful to our safety. Where this is attended to, all other things will be rightly pursued. Christ declared, Mary hath chosen the good part. For one thing is needful, this one thing that she has done, to give up herself to the guidance of Christ. The things of this life will be taken away from us, at the furthest, when we shall be taken away from them; but nothing shall separate from the love of Christ, and a part in that love. Men and devils cannot take it away from us, and God and Christ will not. Let us mind the one thing needful more diligently.</body></html>
