In the power to "tread on serpents and scorpions," we have a manifest reference to the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm" title="You shall tread on the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet.">Psalm 91:13</a>. Those words stand in closest sequence with the promise which had been wrested from its true meaning by the Tempter in the great struggle in the wilderness; and it is not over-bold to think that they were connected with our Lord's memories of that time, and especially of the fact indicated by St. Mark's statement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-13.htm" title="And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.">Mark 1:13</a>) that He "was with the wild beasts." Now, through resistance to the Temptation, there had come the victory which if He had then yielded, never would have been won. Of a literal fulfilment of the words, St. Paul's escape from the viper at Melita (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-3.htm" title="And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.">Acts 28:3</a>) is the only recorded instance; but the parallelism between this promise and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm" title="You shall tread on the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet.">Psalm 91:13</a> shows that the literal meaning falls into the background, that the serpent and the scorpion are symbols of spiritual powers of evil. A merely literal interpretation lands us in two serious difficulties: (1) that it represents the treading on serpents as a greater work than casting out demons; and (2) that it implies that serpents and scorpions, as such, are not part of God's creation, but belong to the power of the Evil One. So far as we think of a literal fulfilment at all, it can only be as the symbol and earnest of the spiritual. The real kernel of the promise lies in the last words, "Nothing shall by any means hurt you," and these find their interpretation in the thought that "nothing shall separate us from the love of God," and that "all things work together for good to those that love Him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-39.htm" title="Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.">Romans 8:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy</span>. The older authorities read here, "I have given." The only recorded instance of a literal fulfilment of this promise was in the case of Paul at Melita, after the shipwreck (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-3.htm">Acts 24:3-5</a>). A similar promise was made during the "forty days" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-17.htm">Mark 16:17, 18</a>). It seems however, best, in the case of this peculiar promise, to interpret the Lord's words as referring to spiritual powers of evil, taking the serpent and scorpion as symbols of these. It should be remembered that the subject of conversation between the Master and his servants was the conflict with and victory ever these awful powers restlessly hostile to the human race (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:17-24 All our victories over Satan, are obtained by power derived from Jesus Christ, and he must have all the praise. But let us beware of spiritual pride, which has been the destruction of many. Our Lord rejoiced at the prospect of the salvation of many souls. It was fit that particular notice should be taken of that hour of joy; there were few such, for He was a man of sorrows: in that hour in which he saw Satan fall, and heard of the good success of his ministers, in that hour he rejoiced. He has ever resisted the proud, and given grace to the humble. The more simply dependent we are on the teaching, help, and blessing of the Son of God, the more we shall know both of the Father and of the Son; the more blessed we shall be in seeing the glory, and hearing the words of the Divine Saviour; and the more useful we shall be made in promoting his cause.</body></html>
