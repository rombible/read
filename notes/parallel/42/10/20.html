That was the great blessing for them, and for all believing souls after them. The words leave open the question whether that registration conferred a title which they could not forfeit, and the current language of the Old Testament--the prayer of Moses, "Blot me out of Thy book" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>), the warnings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-33.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.">Exodus 32:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm" title="Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-20.htm" title="The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie on him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.">Deuteronomy 29:20</a><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-5.htm" title="He that overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.">Revelation 3:5</a> as the reward of obedience, and therefore conditioned by it, no less than the general tenor of the teaching of the Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm" title="I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm" title="Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:">2Peter 1:10</a>), confirms this interpretation. It may be noted (1) that the better MSS. omit the word "rather," and introduce the second clause abruptly--"Rejoice that your names are written . . .;" and (2), as implied above, that the root-thought of the image is that of a king taking the census of those who are citizens of his kingdom, as distinguished from aliens and foreigners. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/87-4.htm" title="I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.">Psalm 87:4-5</a>, we have a memorable instance at once of the literal fact and of its spiritual application.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven</span>. "After all," went on the wise and loving Master, "though you have made the glad discovery of the power you possess, if, as my servants, you use aright my Name, after all, your real reason for joy is, not the possession of a new, mighty power, but the fact of your name having been written in the book of life as one of my servants commissioned to do my work." Many commentators here cautiously point out that even this legitimate joy should be tempered with fear and trembling, for even this true title to honour might be blotted nut of that golden book of heaven (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-33.htm">Exodus 32:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-28.htm">Psalm 69:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-19.htm">Revelation 22:19</a>). In <span class="accented">this</span> deep legitimate joy men and women of all callings, who try to follow the Master, in every age, may share. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:17-24 All our victories over Satan, are obtained by power derived from Jesus Christ, and he must have all the praise. But let us beware of spiritual pride, which has been the destruction of many. Our Lord rejoiced at the prospect of the salvation of many souls. It was fit that particular notice should be taken of that hour of joy; there were few such, for He was a man of sorrows: in that hour in which he saw Satan fall, and heard of the good success of his ministers, in that hour he rejoiced. He has ever resisted the proud, and given grace to the humble. The more simply dependent we are on the teaching, help, and blessing of the Son of God, the more we shall know both of the Father and of the Son; the more blessed we shall be in seeing the glory, and hearing the words of the Divine Saviour; and the more useful we shall be made in promoting his cause.</body></html>
