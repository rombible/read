He too, in the outer framework of the story, is one of the children of this world, and he admires the sharpness and quickness of the steward's action. In the interpretation of the story, we trace once more the grave, half-veiled indignation, more keenly incisive than if the veil had been withdrawn, which so often appears in this phase of our Lord's teaching. If this world were all, there would be a wisdom worthy of praise when a Church or its teachers adapted themselves to men's passions or interests at the expense of Truth. That which makes such action hateful is that by so doing the children of light transform themselves into the children of this world.<p><span class= "bld">The unjust steward.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the steward of unrighteousness,</span> St. Luke using the half-Hebrew idiom of a genitive of the characteristic attribute. (Comp. the "mammon of unrighteousness" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>, and the "unjust judge" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-6.htm" title="And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge said.">Luke 18:6</a>, where the same idiom is used.)<p><span class= "bld">The children of this world are in their generation wiser . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for their generation,</span> with a view, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to their own advantages and interests, and those of others like them.<p><span class= "bld">Wiser than the children of light.</span>--The word for "wise" is that used by our Lord in "wise as serpents" (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>). In "children of light" (literally, <span class= "ital">sons of light</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> though usage has made the Hebrew idiom familiar, we have another example of the genitive of characteristic attribute. We may note the recurrence of the phrase (with the variation of the Greek word for "children" instead of "sons") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm" title="For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:">Ephesians 5:8</a> as another instance of the way in which the phraseology of St. Paul was influenced by that of the words of the Lord Jesus collected by his fellow-labourer. "Children of light" are those in whom light is the prevailing element of their life, and they are necessarily also children of God; for "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1John 1:5</a>).<p>It must be left to the thoughtful reader to judge how far this exposition of the parable is coherent and satisfying in itself, and in harmony with the general teaching of our Lord. Those who will may compare it, apart from the real or imagined authority of this or that name, with the other interpretations which find in it a lesson (1) to the publicans (like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-13.htm" title="And he said to them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.">Luke 3:13</a>) to exact no more than that which is appointed them; or (2) to all Christians to be as lenient in dealing with their "debtors" as the steward was with his master's; or (3) a simple example of quickness and prudence in things temporal, which Christians are to reproduce, m<span class= "ital">utatis mutandis,</span> in dealing with things eternal; or (4) which hold, as the main point of the parable, that the steward's master was ignorant of his fraudulent collusion with the debtors; or (5) find in the call to give an account of his stewardship nothing but the approach of death; or (6) teach that the master is Mammon, and that the disciples were accused by the Pharisees of wasting his goods when they became followers of Christ; or (7) that the steward stands for the publicans as a class, and then for all Christians generally; or (8) for Judas Iscariot; or (9) for Pontius Pilate; or (10) for our Lord Himself; or (11) for St. Paul; or (12) for an example of the true penitent; or (13) for the devil. The wild diversity of interpretations which this list partially represents, should make any commentator more or less distrustful of what seems to him an adequate and complete exposition; and it may well be, even after an exposition as full as the conditions of the case seem to render possible, that there are side-lights in the parable which are yet unnoticed, and further applications which, as being founded on real analogies, might be instructive and legitimate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely.</span> This, again, is a detail which has little bearing on the main teaching. It is a graphic and sarcastic eulogy which a good-humoured man of the world would pronounce upon a brilliant and skilful, although unprincipled, action, and it completes the story as a story. It seems evident that the intentions of the steward in regard to the debtors were carried out, and that they were really indebted to him for the release of a part of their indebtedness, and that the owner of the property did not dispute the arrangement entered into by his steward when in office<span class="cmt_word">. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light</span>. This was a melancholy and sorrowful reflection. It seems to say, "I have been painting, indeed, from the life. See, the children of this world, men and women whose ends and aims are bounded by the horizon of this world, who only live for this life, how much more painstaking and skilful are <span class="accented">they</span> in their working for the perishable things of this world than are the children of light in their noble toiling after the things of the life to come. The former appear even more in earnest in their search after what they desire than do the latter. There is underlying the Lord's deep and sorrowful reflection here, a mournful regret over one feature that is, alas! characteristic of well-nigh all religious life - the unkindness which religious professors so often show to one another. One great division of Christianity despises, almost hates, the other; sect detests sect; a very slight difference in religious opinion bars the way to all friendship, often to even kindly feeling. With truth Godet remarks here "that the <span class="accented">children of this world</span> use every means for their own interest to strengthen the bonds which unite them to their contemporaries of the same stamp, but, on the other hand, the <span class="accented">children of light</span> neglect this natural measure of prudence; they forget to use God's goods to form bonds of love to the contemporaries who <span class="accented">might</span> one day give them a full recompense, when they themselves shall want everything, and these shall have abundance." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-12 Whatever we have, the property of it is God's; we have only the use of it, according to the direction of our great Lord, and for his honour. This steward wasted his lord's goods. And we are all liable to the same charge; we have not made due improvement of what God has trusted us with. The steward cannot deny it; he must make up his accounts, and be gone. This may teach us that death will come, and deprive us of the opportunities we now have. The steward will make friends of his lord's debtors or tenants, by striking off a considerable part of their debt to his lord. The lord referred to in this parable commended not the fraud, but the policy of the steward. In that respect alone is it so noticed. Worldly men, in the choice of their object, are foolish; but in their activity, and perseverance, they are often wiser than believers. The unjust steward is not set before us as an example in cheating his master, or to justify any dishonesty, but to point out the careful ways of worldly men. It would be well if the children of light would learn wisdom from the men of the world, and would as earnestly pursue their better object. The true riches signify spiritual blessings; and if a man spends upon himself, or hoards up what God has trusted to him, as to outward things, what evidence can he have, that he is an heir of God through Christ? The riches of this world are deceitful and uncertain. Let us be convinced that those are truly rich, and very rich, who are rich in faith, and rich toward God, rich in Christ, in the promises; let us then lay up our treasure in heaven, and expect our portion from thence.</body></html>
