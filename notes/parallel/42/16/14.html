(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-1.htm" title="And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.">Luke 16:1</a>.) The word for "covetous" is literally <span class= "ital">lovers of money,</span> as distinct from more general cupidity, and as being used by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm" title="For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,">2Timothy 3:2</a>, and nowhere else in the New Testament, furnishes another instance of community of language between him and the Evangelist.<p><span class= "bld">Derided him.</span>--The verb implies visible rather than audible signs of scorn--the distended nostril, and the sneering lip, the <span class= "ital">naso suspendere adunco</span> of the Roman satirist. It is, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a word that forcibly expresses the physiognomy of contempt (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm" title="Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.">Galatians 6:7</a>). Here again we have a word common to the two writers just named. The motive of the derision lies on the surface. That they, the teachers of Israel, should be told that they were like the Unjust Steward, that they were wasting their Lord's goods, that they must make friends with the unrighteous mammon of quite another kind than those whom they were wont to court--this was more than they could stand. They have felt the force of the rebuke, and therefore they stifle it with mockery--<p>"A little grain of conscience made them sour."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him</span>. This shows that many of the dominant sect had been present and had listened to the parable of the unjust steward. Although scrupulous, and in a way religious men, these Pharisees were notorious for their respect and regard for riches, and all that riches purchase, and they felt, no doubt deeply, the Lord's bitter reproach of covetousness. <span class="accented">They</span>, the rulers and leaders of Israel, the religious guides, were evidently attacked in such teaching as they had been lately listening to, not the common people whom they so despised. The scornful words alluded to in the expression, "they derided him," were no doubt directed against the outward poverty of the popular Galilaean Teacher. "It is all very well," they would say, "for one springing from the ranks of the people, landless, moneyless, to rail at wealth and the possessors of wealth; we can understand such teaching from one such as <span class="accented">you."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:13-18 To this parable our Lord added a solemn warning. Ye cannot serve God and the world, so divided are the two interests. When our Lord spoke thus, the covetous Pharisees treated his instructions with contempt. But he warned them, that what they contended for as the law, was a wresting of its meaning: this our Lord showed in a case respecting divorce. There are many covetous sticklers for the forms of godliness, who are the bitterest enemies to its power, and try to set others against the truth.</body></html>
