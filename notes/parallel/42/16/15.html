The word there used, "this man went down to his house <span class= "ital">justified</span> rather than the other," is obviously a reference to what is reported here. They forgot, in their self-righteousness and self-vindication, that they stood before God as the Searcher of all hearts.<p><span class= "bld">That which is highly esteemed among men . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">that which is high,</span> or <span class= "ital">lifted up,</span> among men. The word is at once wider and more vivid than the English.<p><span class= "bld">Abomination . . .</span>--The word is the same as in "the abomination of desolation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-15.htm" title="When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)">Matthew 24:15</a>), that which causes physically nausea and loathing. The word seems chosen as the expression of a divine scorn and indignation, which answered, in part, to their "derision," and was its natural result. (Comp. the bold language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm" title="He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.">Psalm 2:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm" title="I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes;">Proverbs 1:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-16.htm" title="So then because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth.">Revelation 3:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts</span>. The part the Pharisees played in public imposed upon the people. The great influence which they exercised was in great measure due to the respect generally felt for their strict and religious lives. The hypocrisy of this famous sect - it was probably in many cases unconscious hypocrisy - and the false colouring which it gave religion, contributed not a little to the state of things which led to the final disruption of the Jewish nation as a nation some forty years after these words were spoken. It is only a student of the Talmud who can form any notion of the Pharisee mind; a superficial study even of parts of this strange, mighty collection will show why our Lord was so seemingly hard in his rebukes of these often earnest and religious men; it will show, too, why the same Divine Master at times seemed to change his words of bitter wrath into accents of the tenderest sympathy and love. For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. Especially alluding to that haughty pride of men in wealth and money, which, after all, is not theirs. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:13-18 To this parable our Lord added a solemn warning. Ye cannot serve God and the world, so divided are the two interests. When our Lord spoke thus, the covetous Pharisees treated his instructions with contempt. But he warned them, that what they contended for as the law, was a wresting of its meaning: this our Lord showed in a case respecting divorce. There are many covetous sticklers for the forms of godliness, who are the bitterest enemies to its power, and try to set others against the truth.</body></html>
