(Comp. the language of the Syro-Ph?nician woman, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-28.htm" title="And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.">Mark 7:28</a>.) Here the picture is heightened by two touches. The dogs are there, and get the crumbs, which the man fails to get, and then they come and lick the open sores. The question has been raised whether this touch is meant to intensify the sufferings of the beggar, or to contrast the almost human sympathy of the brute with the brutal apathy of the man. In a European apologue the latter might, perhaps, be a legitimate explanation of the fact thus stated; but with the Eastern feelings, that see in the dog an unclean beast, the scavenger of the streets, we cannot doubt that the beggar would have shrunk from their licking, even assuming, which is doubtful, that it brought with it some relief from merely physical pain. It may be noted, too, that the word for "dogs" is not the diminutive form used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm" title="And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.">Matthew 15:27</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-28.htm" title="And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.">Mark 7:28</a> (where see Note), which implied tameness, but that which is always associated with the idea of abhorrence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.">Matthew 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-22.htm" title="But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.">2Peter 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm" title="For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.">Revelation 22:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:19-31 Here the spiritual things are represented, in a description of the different state of good and bad, in this world and in the other. We are not told that the rich man got his estate by fraud, or oppression; but Christ shows, that a man may have a great deal of the wealth, pomp, and pleasure of this world, yet perish for ever under God's wrath and curse. The sin of this rich man was his providing for himself only. Here is a godly man, and one that will hereafter be happy for ever, in the depth of adversity and distress. It is often the lot of some of the dearest of God's saints and servants to be greatly afflicted in this world. We are not told that the rich man did him any harm, but we do not find that he had any care for him. Here is the different condition of this godly poor man, and this wicked rich man, at and after death. The rich man in hell lifted up his eyes, being in torment. It is not probable that there are discourses between glorified saints and damned sinners, but this dialogue shows the hopeless misery and fruitless desires, to which condemned spirits are brought. There is a day coming, when those who now hate and despise the people of God, would gladly receive kindness from them. But the damned in hell shall not have the least abatement of their torment. Sinners are now called upon to remember; but they do not, they will not, they find ways to avoid it. As wicked people have good things only in this life, and at death are for ever separated from all good, so godly people have evil things only in this life, and at death they are for ever put from them. In this world, blessed be God, there is no gulf between a state of nature and grace, we may pass from sin to God; but if we die in our sins, there is no coming out. The rich man had five brethren, and would have them stopped in their sinful course; their coming to that place of torment, would make his misery the worse, who had helped to show them the way thither. How many would now desire to recall or to undo what they have written or done! Those who would make the rich man's praying to Abraham justify praying to saints departed, go far to seek for proofs, when the mistake of a damned sinner is all they can find for an example. And surely there is no encouragement to follow the example, when all his prayers were made in vain. A messenger from the dead could say no more than what is said in the Scriptures. The same strength of corruption that breaks through the convictions of the written word, would triumph over a witness from the dead. Let us seek to the law and to the testimony, Isa 8:19,20, for that is the sure word of prophecy, upon which we may rest, 2Pe 1:19. Circumstances in every age show that no terrors, or arguments, can give true repentance without the special grace of God renewing the sinner's heart.</body></html>
