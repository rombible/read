St. Luke, for some reason or other (possibly because he had recorded like teaching in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm" title="Whoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her that is put away from her husband commits adultery.">Luke 16:18</a>), omits the previous teaching as to divorce. The use of the specific word for "infants" is peculiar to him. The use of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-41.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:">Luke 1:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-44.htm" title="For, see, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.">Luke 1:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-12.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you; You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.">Luke 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-16.htm" title="And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.">Luke 2:16</a>, where it is rendered "babe," shows that it includes the very earliest stage of childhood, and so is not without its importance in its bearing on the question of infant baptism, so far as that question is affected by this narrative.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-30.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus and the children.

Our Lord's noticing children is several times alluded to in the Gospels. There was something evidently in his look and manner which singularly attracted little ones to him. SS. Matthew and Mark both recount this blessing of the children immediately after the teaching on divorce. Our Lord thus sanctifies the bond of marriage and its legitimate offspring. It was a silent but powerful reply to the mistaken inference which his disciples had drawn from his words. They had said, "It is not good to marry" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-10.htm">Matthew 19:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them</span>. Something of what the Master had said concerning the marriage state affected the disciples. Had he not just (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-10.htm">Matthew 19:10-12</a>) been claiming high honour for the solitary life where there were no family ties to claim attention? Surely, then, these women and their children had better stand aloof: what had that grave and earnest Teacher of theirs to do with these? He had higher and more important matters on his mind f <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:15-17 None are too little, too young, to be brought to Christ, who knows how to show kindness to those not capable of doing service to him. It is the mind of Christ, that little children should be brought to him. The promise is to us, and to our seed; therefore He will bid them welcome to him with us. And we must receive his kingdom as children, not by purchase, and must call it our Father's gift.</body></html>
