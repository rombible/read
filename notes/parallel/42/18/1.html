The whole verse is remarkable as being one of the few instances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-9.htm" title="And he spoke this parable to certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:">Luke 18:9</a> being another) in which a parable is introduced by a distinct statement as to its drift and aim.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - <span class="accented">The Lord speaks the two parables on prayer</span> - <span class="accented">the importunate widow, and the Pharisee and publican.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint</span>. The formnla <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, literally, "and he spake also," calls attention to the fact that the parable-teaching immediately to follow was a continuation of what had preceded. Indeed, the connection between the first of the two parables, which urges restless continued prayer, and the picture which the Lord had just drawn of men's state of utter forgetfulness of God, is obvious. "The Son of man has been rejected; he has gone from view; the masses are plunged in gross worldliness; men of God are become as rare as, in the days of Abraham, they were in Sodom. What, then, is the position of the Church? That of a widow whose only weapon is incessant prayer. It is only by means of this intense concentration that faith will be preserved. But such is precisely the disposition which Jesus fears may not be found even in the Church at his return" (Godet). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 All God's people are praying people. Here earnest steadiness in prayer for spiritual mercies is taught. The widow's earnestness prevailed even with the unjust judge: she might fear lest it should set him more against her; but our earnest prayer is pleasing to our God. Even to the end there will still be ground for the same complaint of weakness of faith.</body></html>
