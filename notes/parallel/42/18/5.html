Literally, however, it expresses the act of the pugilist when he strikes a blow which leaves a livid bruise on his opponent's face, and it would seem to have been transferred, in the natural transition of popular metaphor into the forms of colloquial language, from the arena to common life. So we talk of men "hitting hard" or "giving a knock-down blow" in controversy or debate. What is described here is the continuous shower of blows, each of which is short of a "knock-down," while their accumulative effect is, in the nearest equivalent of modern English, that the man is so "punished" that he is glad to give over at any price.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 All God's people are praying people. Here earnest steadiness in prayer for spiritual mercies is taught. The widow's earnestness prevailed even with the unjust judge: she might fear lest it should set him more against her; but our earnest prayer is pleasing to our God. Even to the end there will still be ground for the same complaint of weakness of faith.</body></html>
