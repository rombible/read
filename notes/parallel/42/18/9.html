It is, perhaps, open for us to think that isolated fragments of our Lord's teaching, treasured up here and there in the memory of disciples, and written down in answer to St. Luke's inquiries in the second stage of the growth of the Gospel records, would be likely to have such an introduction.<p>The "certain which trusted" are not specified as being actually Pharisees, and included, we may believe, disciples in whom the Pharisee temper was gaining the mastery, and who needed to be taught as by a <span class= "ital">reductio ad absurdum,</span> what it naturally led to.<p><span class= "bld">Despised others.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the rest</span>--<span class= "ital">viz.,</span> all others. The word for "despise," literally, <span class= "ital">count as nothing,</span> is again one of those which St. Luke has, and the other Evangelists have not (that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-12.htm" title="And he answered and told them, Elias truly comes first, and restores all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nothing.">Mark 9:12</a> differs in form), but which is frequent in the vocabulary of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-3.htm" title="Let not him that eats despise him that eats not; and let not him which eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him.">Romans 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm" title="But why do you judge your brother? or why do you set at nothing your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.">Romans 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-11.htm" title="Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come to me: for I look for him with the brothers.">1Corinthians 16:11</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> This universal depreciation of others would seem almost an exaggeration, if experience did not show--<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as in the history of Montanism and analogous forms of error--how easily men and women, religious societies and orders, drift into it, and how hard it is to set any limits to the monomania of egotism--above all, of religious egotism. It never uttered itself, perhaps, in a more repulsive form than when the Pharisees came to speak of the great mass of their brother-Israelites as the brute people, the "people of the earth."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake this parable</span>. With this parable, "the Pharisee and the publican," St. Luke concludes his memories of the last journeyings toward Jerusalem. The incidents which directly follow took place close to Jerusalem; and here St. Luke's narrative rejoins that of SS. Matthew and Mark. No note of time or place assists us in defining exactly the period when the Master spoke this teaching; some time, however, in these last journeyings, that is, in the closing months of the public ministry, the parable in question was certainly spoken. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:9-14 This parable was to convince some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others. God sees with what disposition and design we come to him in holy ordinances. What the Pharisee said, shows that he trusted to himself that he was righteous. We may suppose he was free from gross and scandalous sins. All this was very well and commendable. Miserable is the condition of those who come short of the righteousness of this Pharisee, yet he was not accepted; and why not? He went up to the temple to pray, but was full of himself and his own goodness; the favour and grace of God he did not think worth asking. Let us beware of presenting proud devotions to the Lord, and of despising others. The publican's address to God was full of humility, and of repentance for sin, and desire toward God. His prayer was short, but to the purpose; God be merciful to me a sinner. Blessed be God, that we have this short prayer upon record, as an answered prayer; and that we are sure that he who prayed it, went to his house justified; for so shall we be, if we pray it, as he did, through Jesus Christ. He owned himself a sinner by nature, by practice, guilty before God. He had no dependence but upon the mercy of God; upon that alone he relied. And God's glory is to resist the proud, and give grace to the humble. Justification is of God in Christ; therefore the self-condemned, and not the self-righteous, are justified before God.</body></html>
