Caves in the limestone rocks of Judaea were so often used as stables, that there is nothing improbable in the tradition. The present Church of the Nativity has beneath it a natural crypt or cavern, in which St. Jerome is said to have passed many years, compiling his Latin translation (that known as the Vulgate) of the Sacred Scriptures. The traditional ox and ass, which appear in well-nigh every stage of Christian art in pictures of the Nativity, are probably traceable to a fanciful interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm" title="The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.">Isaiah 1:3</a>, which is, indeed, cited in the Apocryphal Gospel ascribed to St. Matthew, as being thus fulfilled.<p><span class= "bld">There was no room for them in the inn.</span>--The statement implies that the town was crowded with persons who had come up to be registered there--some, perhaps, exulting, like Joseph, in their descent from David.

This expression has no real bearing on the question respecting the relationship of the so-called brethren of Jesus to Mary. The writer of this commentary, without hesitation, accepts the general tradition of the Catholic Church as expressed by the great majority of her teachers in all ages. This tradition pronounces these brethren to have been <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> either his half-brethren, sons of Joseph by a former marriage; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his cousins. In the passage in Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>), "when he bringeth in the <span class="accented">First Begotten</span> into the world," "First Begotten" signifies "Only Begotten." (On the whole question, see Bishop Lightfoot's exhaustive essay on the "Brethren of the Lord" in his 'Commentary on the Galatians.') <span class="cmt_word">There was no room for them in the inn</span>. "The inn of Bethlehem, what in modern Eastern travel is known as a <span class="accented">khan</span> or <span class="accented">caravanserai</span>, as distinct from a hostelry (the 'inn' of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>). Such an inn or khan offered to the traveler simply the shelter of its walls and roofs. This khan of Bethlehem had a memorable history of its own, being named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a> as the 'inn of Chimham,' the place of rendezvous from which travelers started on their journey to Egypt. It was so called after the son of Barzillai, whom David seems to have treated as an adopted son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37, 38</a>), and was probably built by him in his patron's city as a testimony of his gratitude" (Dean Plumptre). The stable was not unfrequently a limestone cave, and there is a very ancient tradition that there was a cave of this description attached to the "inn," or caravanserai, of Bethlehem. This "inn" would, no doubt, be a large one, owing to its being in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, and would often be crowded with the poorer class of pilgrims who went up to the temple at the seasons of the greater feasts. Bethlehem is only six miles from Jerusalem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The fulness of time was now come, when God would send forth his Son, made of a woman, and made under the law. The circumstances of his birth were very mean. Christ was born at an inn; he came into the world to sojourn here for awhile, as at an inn, and to teach us to do likewise. We are become by sin like an outcast infant, helpless and forlorn; and such a one was Christ. He well knew how unwilling we are to be meanly lodged, clothed, or fed; how we desire to have our children decorated and indulged; how apt the poor are to envy the rich, and how prone the rich to disdain the poor. But when we by faith view the Son of God being made man and lying in a manger, our vanity, ambition, and envy are checked. We cannot, with this object rightly before us, seek great things for ourselves or our children.</body></html>
