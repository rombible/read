His education began, at first under the mother's care. At five he was to learn the Law, at first by extracts written on scrolls of the more important passages, the Shemk or Creed of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-4.htm" title="And command you the people, saying, You are to pass through the coast of your brothers the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take you good heed to yourselves therefore:">Deuteronomy 2:4</a>, the Hallel or Festival Psalms (Psalms 114-118, 136), and by catechetical teaching in school. At twelve he became more directly responsible for his obedience to the Law, and on the day when he attained the age of thirteen, put on for the first time the phylacteries which were worn at the recital of his daily prayer. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-5.htm" title="But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,">Matthew 23:5</a>.) It was accordingly an epoch of transition analogous to that which obtains among us at Confirmation. It was, therefore in strict accordance with usage, with perhaps a slight anticipation of the actual day, that the "child Jesus" should, at the age of twelve, have gone up with His parents to Jerusalem. If the conjecture suggested in the Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-8.htm" title="And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.">Luke 2:8</a>, that the birth of our Lord coincided with the Paschal Season, be accepted, He may actually have completed His thirteenth year during the Feast; and so have become, in the fullest sense, one of the "children of the Law," bound to study it and know its meaning. This at least fits in with, and in fact explains, the narrative that follows. In the later Maxims of the Fathers (<span class= "ital">Pirke Aboth</span>) two other stages of education were marked out. At ten, a boy was to enter on the study of the <span class= "ital">Mischna </span>(= "comments"), or body of traditional interpretations of the Law; at eighteen, on that of the <span class= "ital">Gemara </span>(= "completeness"), or wider collection of sayings or legends, which, with the <span class= "ital">Mischna, </span>made up what is known as the <span class= "ital">Talmud </span>(= "learning," or "doctrine").<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast</span>. When a Jewish boy was three years old he was given the tasselled garment directed by the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>). At five he usually began to learn portions of the Law, under his mother's direction; these were passages written on scrolls, such as the shema or creed of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, the Hallel Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114.htm">Psalm 114, 118, 136</a>). When the boy was thirteen years old he wore, for the first time, the phylacteries, which the Jew always put on at the recital of the daily prayer. In the well-known and most ancient 'Maxims of the Fathers' ('Pirke Avoth'), we read that, at the age of ten, a boy was to commence the study of the Mishna (the Mishna was a compilation of traditional interpretations of the Law); at eighteen he was to be instructed in the Gemara (the Gemara was a vast collection of interpretations of the Mishna. The Mishua and Gemara together make up the Talmud. The Mishna may roughly be termed the text, the Gemara the commentary, of the Talmud). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:41-52 It is for the honour of Christ that children should attend on public worship. His parents did not return till they had stayed all the seven days of the feast. It is well to stay to the end of an ordinance, as becomes those who say, It is good to be here. Those that have lost their comforts in Christ, and the evidences of their having a part in him, must bethink themselves where, and when, and how they lost them, and must turn back again. Those that would recover their lost acquaintance with Christ, must go to the place in which he has put his name; there they may hope to meet him. They found him in some part of the temple, where the doctors of the law kept their schools; he was sitting there, hearkening to their instructions, proposing questions, and answering inquiries, with such wisdom, that those who heard were delighted with him. Young persons should seek the knowledge of Divine truth, attend the ministry of the gospel, and ask such questions of their elders and teachers as may tend to increase their knowledge. Those who seek Christ in sorrow, shall find him with the greater joy. Know ye not that I ought to be in my Father's house; at my Father's work; I must be about my Father's business. Herein is an example; for it becomes the children of God, in conformity to Christ, to attend their heavenly Father's business, and make all other concerns give way to it. Though he was the Son of God, yet he was subject to his earthly parents; how then will the foolish and weak sons of men answer it, who are disobedient to their parents? However we may neglect men's sayings, because they are obscure, yet we must not think so of God's sayings. That which at first is dark, may afterwards become plain and easy. The greatest and wisest, those most eminent, may learn of this admirable and Divine Child, that it is the truest greatness of soul to know our own place and office; to deny ourselves amusements and pleasures not consistent with our state and calling.</body></html>
