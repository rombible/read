The thought is the same as in "he that endureth to the end" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-22.htm" title="And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-13.htm" title="But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.">Matthew 24:13</a>), but the noun does not occur in the other Gospels. It occurs thirteen times in St. Paul's Epistles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the Word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience</span>. In this portraiture of the fourth class of our Lord's great life-picture of hearers of and inquirers concerning religion, the Greek words rendered in the Authorized Version "honest" and "good" ("in an honest and good heart ") were words well known and in familiar use among the widely spread Greek-speaking peoples for whom especially St. Luke's Gospel was compiled. Professor Bruce ('Parabolic Teaching of Christ,' ch. 1.) remarks that "the man who united the two qualities expressed by the term 'honest' (better rendered 'noble') and 'good,' represented the beau-ideal of manhood. He was one whose aim was noble, and who was generously devoted to his aim. The expression rendered 'honest' (better translated 'noble,' <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) has reference to aims or chief ends, and describes one whose mind is raised above moral vulgarity, and is bent, not on money-making and such low pursuits, but on the attainment of wisdom, holiness, and righteousness. The epithet rendered 'good' (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) denotes generous self-abandonment in the prosecution of lofty ends; large-heartedness, magnanimous, overflowing devotion." Mary of Bethany, with her devoted love and her generous friendship; the centurion Cornelius, with his fervent piety and his noble generosity towards a despised and hated race; Barnabas, with his splendid liberality, his utter absence of care for self, his bright, loving trust in human nature, his true charity, "bearing all things, hoping all things;" - are good examples, drawn from different sexes and from varied races, and out of diverse paths of life, of these true inquirers, who not only hear the Word, but keep it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-21 There are many very needful and excellent rules and cautions for hearing the word, in the parable of the sower, and the application of it. Happy are we, and for ever indebted to free grace, if the same thing that is a parable to others, with which they are only amused, is a plain truth to us, by which we are taught and governed. We ought to take heed of the things that will hinder our profiting by the word we hear; to take heed lest we hear carelessly and slightly, lest we entertain prejudices against the word we hear; and to take heed to our spirits after we have heard the word, lest we lose what we have gained. The gifts we have, will be continued to us or not, as we use them for the glory of God, and the good of our brethren. Nor is it enough not to hold the truth in unrighteousness; we should desire to hold forth the word of life, and to shine, giving light to all around. Great encouragement is given to those who prove themselves faithful hearers of the word, by being doers of the work. Christ owns them as his relations.</body></html>
