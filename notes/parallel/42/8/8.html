This is by no means an unheard-of increase even in the West, where vegetation is less luxuriant. Herodotus, quoted by Trench ('Parables'), mentions that two hundredfold was a common return in the Plain of Babylon, and sometimes three hundredfold; and Niebuhr mentions a species of maize that returns four hundredfold. On the marvellous fruit-bearing which would take place in the days of the Lord's future kingdom on earth, Irenaeus gives a quotation from Papias, who gave it on the authority of those who had heard St. John speak of the teaching of the Lord to that effect. Professor Westcott ('Introduction to the Study of the Gospels,' Appendix C, 21) thinks that the tradition was based on the real discourses of the Lord. It is, of course, allegorical, for is it not a memory cf. a conversation between Jesus and his disciples arising out of this parable of the sower? "The Lord taught of those days (of his future kingdom on earth) and said, The <span class="accented">days will come in which vines shall spring up</span>, <span class="accented">each having</span>, <span class="accented">ten thousand stocks</span>, <span class="accented">and on each stock ten thousand branches</span>, <span class="accented">and on each branch ten thousand shoots</span>, <span class="accented">and on each shoot ten thousand bunches</span>, <span class="accented">and on each bunch ten thousand grapes</span>, <span class="accented">and each grape when pressed shalt give five and twenty measures of wine. And when any saint shall have seized one bunch</span>, <span class="accented">another shall cry</span>, <span class="accented">I am a better bunch</span>; <span class="accented">take me</span>; <span class="accented">through me bless the Lord.</span> Likewise also (he said) that <span class="accented">a grain of wheat shall produce ten thousand ears of corn</span>, <span class="accented">and each grain ten pounds of fine pure flour</span>; <span class="accented">and so all other fruits</span>, <span class="accented">and seeds</span>, <span class="accented">and each herb according to its proper nature.. .</span> And he (Papias) added, saying, Now, these things are credible to them that believe. And when Judas the traitor believed not, and asked - How, then, shall such productions proceed from the Lord? the Lord said, <span class="accented">They shall see who come to those times"</span> (Papias; see Irenaeus, 5:33. 3). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:4-21 There are many very needful and excellent rules and cautions for hearing the word, in the parable of the sower, and the application of it. Happy are we, and for ever indebted to free grace, if the same thing that is a parable to others, with which they are only amused, is a plain truth to us, by which we are taught and governed. We ought to take heed of the things that will hinder our profiting by the word we hear; to take heed lest we hear carelessly and slightly, lest we entertain prejudices against the word we hear; and to take heed to our spirits after we have heard the word, lest we lose what we have gained. The gifts we have, will be continued to us or not, as we use them for the glory of God, and the good of our brethren. Nor is it enough not to hold the truth in unrighteousness; we should desire to hold forth the word of life, and to shine, giving light to all around. Great encouragement is given to those who prove themselves faithful hearers of the word, by being doers of the work. Christ owns them as his relations.</body></html>
