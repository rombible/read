The name was the feminine form of Joannes, and appears in modern languages abbreviated into Joanne, Joan, or Jane. Nothing further is known of Chuza--but the "steward" (the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-8.htm" title="So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last to the first.">Matthew 20:8</a>, and the "tutor" or "guardian" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-2.htm" title="But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.">Galatians 4:2</a>) of the Tetrarch, the manager of his income and expenditure, must have been a man of some mark. We may think of him and his wife as having probably come under the influence of the Baptist or of Manaen, the foster-brother of the Tetrarch, probably also of one of the "servants" to whom Antipas imparted his belief that John the Baptist was risen from the dead. Joanna appears again in the history of the Resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm" title="It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.">Luke 24:10</a>). It is possible, as suggested in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-46.htm" title="So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.">John 4:46</a>, that he may have been identical with the "nobleman" or "member of the royal household" at Capernaum.

They were, we may well believe, among the "eye-witnesses and ministers of the word" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-2.htm" title="Even as they delivered them to us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;">Luke 1:2</a>) from whom he derived much of his information. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward</span>. She must have been a person of wealth and high rank at the court of Herod Antipas. There were evidently not a few believers in that wicked and dissolute centre. Some years later we read of Manaen, the foster-brother of Herod, as a notable Christian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>). Even Herod himself, we know, at first heard John the Baptist gladly. and, after the terrible judicial murder, we find that unhappy prince fancying that his victim had risen from the dead. It has been suggested that this Chuza was the nobleman of Capernaum whose dying son was healed by Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>). If this be the case, there would be a special reason for the loving devotion of this Joanna to the Master. She reappears among the faithful women in the history of the Resurrection (ch. 24:10). <span class="cmt_word">Susanna</span>. The name signifies "lily." The Jews were fond of giving the names of flowers and trees to their girls; thus <span class="accented">Rhoda</span>, a rose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-13.htm">Acts 12:13</a>), <span class="accented">Tamar</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> palm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-2.htm">2 Samuel 13:2</a>), among many instances. Of this Susanna nothing further is known. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-3 We are here told what Christ made the constant business of his life, it was teaching the gospel. Tidings of the kingdom of God are glad tidings, and what Christ came to bring. Certain women attended upon him who ministered to him of their substance. It showed the mean condition to which the Saviour humbled himself, that he needed their kindness, and his great humility, that he accepted it. Though rich, yet for our sakes he became poor.</body></html>
