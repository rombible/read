Fish--as in the miracles of the Five Thousand and the Four, and, we may add, in the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-9.htm" title="As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.">John 21:9</a>--seems to have been the staple article of diet. Honey--as in the proverbial speech which described Canaan as a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm" title="And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm" title="And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-9.htm" title="And he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, even a land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-15.htm" title="Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the land which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-5.htm" title="That I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.">Jeremiah 11:5</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> as in the histories of Samson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-8.htm" title="And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.">Judges 14:8</a>) and Jonathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-27.htm" title="But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: why he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.">1Samuel 14:27</a>) and John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>)--was common enough to enter into the diet of the poor. Even in a time of scarcity, when the corn and the olive crops failed, or were laid waste, butter and honey remained as a resource which did not fail (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm" title="Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.">Isaiah 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-22.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.">Isaiah 7:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:36-49 Jesus appeared in a miraculous manner, assuring the disciples of his peace, though they had so lately forsaken him, and promising spiritual peace with every blessing. Many troublesome thoughts which disquiet our minds, rise from mistakes concerning Christ. All the troublesome thoughts which rise in our hearts at any time, are known to the Lord Jesus, and are displeasing to him. He spake with them on their unreasonable unbelief. Nothing had passed but what was foretold by the prophets, and necessary for the salvation of sinners. And now all men should be taught the nature and necessity of repentance, in order to the forgiveness of their sins. And these blessings were to be sought for, by faith in the name of Jesus. Christ by his Spirit works on the minds of men. Even good men need to have their understandings opened. But that we may have right thoughts of Christ, there needs no more than to be made to understand the Scriptures.</body></html>
