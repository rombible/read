It occupies, however, a prominent place in those which St. Paul enumerates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm" title="And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:">1Corinthians 15:5</a>), and takes its place among the phenomena which indicates St. Paul's acquaintance with the substance of St. Luke's Gospel. What passed at the meeting we can only reverently imagine. Before the Passion, the Lord had "turned and looked" on Peter with a glance of tender and sorrowful reproof (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-61.htm" title="And the Lord turned, and looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.">Luke 22:61</a>). Now, we may believe, He met the repentant eager disciple with the full assurance of pardon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:28-35 If we would have Christ dwell with us, we must be earnest with him. Those that have experienced the pleasure and profit of communion with him, cannot but desire more of his company. He took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. This he did with his usual authority and affection, with the same manner, perhaps with the same words. He here teaches us to crave a blessing on every meal. See how Christ by his Spirit and grace makes himself known to the souls of his people. He opens the Scriptures to them. He meets them at his table, in the ordinance of the Lord's supper; is known to them in breaking of bread. But the work is completed by the opening of the eyes of their mind; yet it is but short views we have of Christ in this world, but when we enter heaven, we shall see him for ever. They had found the preaching powerful, even when they knew not the preacher. Those Scriptures which speak of Christ, will warm the hearts of his true disciples. That is likely to do most good, which affects us with the love of Jesus in dying for us. It is the duty of those to whom he has shown himself, to let others know what he has done for their souls. It is of great use for the disciples of Christ to compare their experiences, and tell them to each other.</body></html>
