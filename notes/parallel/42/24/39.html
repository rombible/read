The Resurrection was a reality, not an appearance. In St. John's words, "which our hands have handled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>), we have an interesting coincidence with the use of the same word here. The conditions of the problem must remain, however, transcendental and mysterious. There is a real corporeity, and yet there is a manifest exemption from the common conditions of corporeal existence. St. Luke's narrative presents an undesigned coincidence with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm" title="The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.">John 20:25</a>. What Thomas asked for was the evidence which had, he heard, been given to others. Without that evidence he could not, he felt, believe.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.</span> "See," he says, inviting the terror-stricken disciples to a calm, unaffrighted contemplation - "see my hands and my feet pierced with the nails which fastened them to the cross; <span class="accented">it is I myself."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have</span>. The first words quietly told the awe-struck ones to look closely at him, and to ascertain from the dread marks he bore that what they looked upon was Jesus their Master. Then he proceeded to bid them touch him, handle him, and so assure themselves that it was no phantom, no bodiless spirit, that stood before them. These words of the Lord, and the invitation, "handle me, and see," made the deepest impression on the hearers. These, then, were proofs of the Resurrection that admitted of no shadow of doubt. These words, this sight, changed their lives. What cared they afterwards for men and men's threatenings? Death, life, to them were all one. They had <span class="accented">seen</span> the Lord, they had handled with their hands "that which was flora the beginning" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>). Browning forcibly puts this thought which so influenced the first great teachers. The dying St. John is dwelling on the thought that when he is gone there will be none left with men who saw and <span class="accented">touched</span> the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"If I live yet, it is for good, more love<br />Through me to men: be nought but ashes here<br />That keep awhile my semblance, who was John.<br />Still, when they seater, there is left on earth</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">No one alive who knew (consider this!),<br />Saw with his eyes, and handled with his hands,<br />That which was from the first, the Word of life.<br />How will it be when none more saith, 'I saw'?"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">A Death in the Desert.'</span>) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:36-49 Jesus appeared in a miraculous manner, assuring the disciples of his peace, though they had so lately forsaken him, and promising spiritual peace with every blessing. Many troublesome thoughts which disquiet our minds, rise from mistakes concerning Christ. All the troublesome thoughts which rise in our hearts at any time, are known to the Lord Jesus, and are displeasing to him. He spake with them on their unreasonable unbelief. Nothing had passed but what was foretold by the prophets, and necessary for the salvation of sinners. And now all men should be taught the nature and necessity of repentance, in order to the forgiveness of their sins. And these blessings were to be sought for, by faith in the name of Jesus. Christ by his Spirit works on the minds of men. Even good men need to have their understandings opened. But that we may have right thoughts of Christ, there needs no more than to be made to understand the Scriptures.</body></html>
