Did they feel a new light flowing in upon their souls, bringing new meanings into what had before been obscure and hard sayings? Were they content to let the unknown Teacher pass on, and see no more of Him? Their answer showed, in words that meet us afterwards, that their "hearts" already "burnt within them." Here, also, we note the method of the Divine Teacher as an example for other teachers. We often impress truth more effectively, and 'stimulate the desire for further knowledge, by suspending for a time the continued inculcation of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went:</span> <span class="cmt_word">and he made as though he would have gone</span> further. This was no feint or deception. The Lord would have left them then to themselves had they not prayed him with real earnestness to abide with them. "How many are there," says Stier, "to whom he has drawn near, but <span class="accented">with</span> whom he has not tarried, because they have suffered him to 'go away again,' in his living and heart-moving words! How comparatively rare is it for men to reach the full blessing they might receive (see, for example, the striking historical instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14, 19</a>)!" But these were not content to let the unknown Teacher pass on, and see no more of him, and hear no more of his strange powerful teaching. It is the words of, and the thought contained in, this verse which suggested the idea of the well-known hymn - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Abide with me; fast falls the eventide."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:28-35 If we would have Christ dwell with us, we must be earnest with him. Those that have experienced the pleasure and profit of communion with him, cannot but desire more of his company. He took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. This he did with his usual authority and affection, with the same manner, perhaps with the same words. He here teaches us to crave a blessing on every meal. See how Christ by his Spirit and grace makes himself known to the souls of his people. He opens the Scriptures to them. He meets them at his table, in the ordinance of the Lord's supper; is known to them in breaking of bread. But the work is completed by the opening of the eyes of their mind; yet it is but short views we have of Christ in this world, but when we enter heaven, we shall see him for ever. They had found the preaching powerful, even when they knew not the preacher. Those Scriptures which speak of Christ, will warm the hearts of his true disciples. That is likely to do most good, which affects us with the love of Jesus in dying for us. It is the duty of those to whom he has shown himself, to let others know what he has done for their souls. It is of great use for the disciples of Christ to compare their experiences, and tell them to each other.</body></html>
