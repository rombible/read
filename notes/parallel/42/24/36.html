The mode of appearance in both Gospels suggests the idea, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-31.htm" title="And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.">Luke 24:31</a>, of new conditions of existence, exempted from the physical limitations of the natural body, and shadowing forth the "spiritual body" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1Corinthians 15:44</a>. It may be noted, however, that there had been time for the journey from Emmaus without assuming more than the ordinary modes of motion.<p><span class= "bld">Peace be unto you.</span>--The words do not appear elsewhere as addressed by our Lord to His disciples, but they were, as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-12.htm" title="And when you come into an house, salute it.">Matthew 10:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-5.htm" title="And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house.">Luke 10:5</a>, identical with the customary salutation of the Jews, so that we may fairly assume that here also the familiar words, as before the familiar act, were meant to help the disciples to recognise His presence. St. John records (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>) the same salutation at the same interview.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-49.</span> - The <span class="accented">Lord appears to the apostles as they were gathered together on the evening of the first Easter Day.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst</span> <span class="cmt_word">of them.</span> St. John, who also gives an account of this appearance of the Risen, adds the detail, "when the doors were shut." The eleven and their friends were gathered together for counsel, probably too in hope that something more would happen after what had already taken place that Easter Day - the report of the holy women of the repeated vision of angels, their own verification of the empty sepulchre, and above all the testimony of Peter that he had seen the Lord. Into this anxious, waiting assembly the two "Emmaus" disciples enter with their wondrous story. In the act of their mentally comparing notes, <span class="accented">Jesus himself stood in the midst of them.</span> This sudden presence there is evidently supernatural. He "stood in the midst of them," though the doors were carefully closed and barred "for fear of the Jews" Rumours of the Resurrection, no doubt, had already spread through the city, and it was uncertain whether such turnouts might not be followed by the arrest of the chief followers of the Crucified. <span class="cmt_word">Peace be unto you</span>. This was the ordinary Jewish greeting, but on this occasion, spoken by the Lord, possessed more than the ordinary meaning. This "peace" was his solemn, comforting greeting to his own, just as "his peace" which he left with them on the sad Thursday eve was his solemn farewell to the eleven, spoken, perhaps, in the same "upper room "<span class="accented">just</span> before he went out to the garden of the agony. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:36-49 Jesus appeared in a miraculous manner, assuring the disciples of his peace, though they had so lately forsaken him, and promising spiritual peace with every blessing. Many troublesome thoughts which disquiet our minds, rise from mistakes concerning Christ. All the troublesome thoughts which rise in our hearts at any time, are known to the Lord Jesus, and are displeasing to him. He spake with them on their unreasonable unbelief. Nothing had passed but what was foretold by the prophets, and necessary for the salvation of sinners. And now all men should be taught the nature and necessity of repentance, in order to the forgiveness of their sins. And these blessings were to be sought for, by faith in the name of Jesus. Christ by his Spirit works on the minds of men. Even good men need to have their understandings opened. But that we may have right thoughts of Christ, there needs no more than to be made to understand the Scriptures.</body></html>
