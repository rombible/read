All the four evangelists give an account of the Resurrection. None of the four, however, attempt to give a <span class="accented">history</span> of it simply from a human point of sight. Each Gospel probably reproduces the special points dwelt on in certain great centres of Christian teaching, in what we should now term different schools of thought. (Attempts have been made by theological scholars to <span class="accented">classify</span> these as Jewish, Gentile, Greek, Roman; but only with indifferent success). The teaching which St. Matthew's Gospel represents, evidently in the Resurrection preaching dwelt with peculiar insistence on the great Galilaean appearance of the Risen. St. Luke confines himself exclusively to the appearance, in Judaea. St. John chooses for his Resurrection instruction scenes which had for their theatre both Galilee and Judaea. St. John, as his central or most detailed piece of teaching, dwells on a fishing scene on Gennesaret, the actors being the well-known inner circle of the apostles. While St. Luke chooses for his detailed Resurrection narrative a high-road in a Jerusalem suburb; and for actors, two devoted, but historically unknown, disciples. Then there is no question of <span class="accented">discrepancies</span> in this portion of the great history. It is not easy to frame a perfectly satisfactory harmony of all the events related by the four, after the Lord had risen; for, in fact, we possess no detailed account or history of what took place in that eventful period in presence of the disciples. We simply have memoranda of eye-witnesses of certain <span class="accented">incidents</span> connected with the Resurrection selected by the great first teachers as specially adapted to their own preaching and instruction. The events of the first Easter Day have Been tabulated by Professor Westcott, in what he terms a provisional arrangement, as follows: - <span class="ref_word">APPROX. TIME.</span> Very early on Sunday <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Resurrection, followed by the earthquake, the descent of the angel, the opening of the tomb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2-4</a>). 5 a.m.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mary Magdalene, Mary the [mother] of James and Salome, probably with others, start for the sepulchre in the twilight.

A vision of two angels to Mary Magdalene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11 13</a>).

Not long after he reveals him self, as it appears, to the company of women who are returning to the sepulchre.

If this be assumed to be the fact, there will be nothing improbable in the supposition that both these groups of women, all doubtless intimate friends belonging to the little company of the Master, but living probably some distance apart in Jerusalem, came together some time on the sabbath day, and then arranged to meet early on the first day at the sepulchre. Probably the spices purchased in some haste <span class="accented">just before the sabbath commenced</span> were judged inadequate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-56.htm">Luke 23:56</a> we read of a company of women, most probably including all, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> both groups, of holy women, who, after beholding the sepulchre, "returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and <span class="accented">rested the sabbath day."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-1.htm">Mark 16:1</a> we read, "<span class="accented">When</span> <span class="accented">the sabbath was past</span>, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought [not <span class="accented">had</span> bought] sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him." This company (alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-1.htm">Mark 16:1</a>) arrives <span class="accented">the first</span> at the sepulchre, and sees the vision of one angel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>). The other company (alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>) arrives not long after at the sepulchre, and sees the vision of two angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>). In considering the accounts of the Resurrection, the following memoranda will be found suggestive: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The holy women</span> are the principal actors in all the four accounts of the circumstances connected with the tomb. But their assertions were not believed by the disciples until their statements were confirmed by the Lord's personal appearance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>) sums up the great appearances of our Lord, the basis of our faith, he makes no reference to his appearance to Mary Magdalene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>) or to the women (two Maries mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9, 10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> No evangelist describes the Resurrection-no earthly being having been present. St. Matthew is the evangelist who, in his narrative, goes furthest back. He mentions the shock of the earthquake, the awful presence of the angel, the benumbing terror which seized the guards who were watching. Most probably these signs accompanied the Resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The risen Lord appeared only to his own. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> That no future doubt should be thrown on the <span class="accented">reality</span> of the appearances of the Risen, he showed himself not only to solitary individuals, but to companies, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to two, to the eleven (repeatedly), and to above five hundred brethren at once. And these manifestations took place <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> at different hours of the day; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in different localities - in Judaea, in Galilee, in rooms of houses, in the open air. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> R<span class="accented">esurrection. At the sepulchre.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them</span>. In the foregoing general note on the Resurrection, the probability has been discussed of the holy women having been divided into two companies who separately came to the sepulchre. St. Luke's notice here refers to the party who arrived the second at the tomb. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-12 See the affection and respect the women showed to Christ, after he was dead and buried. Observe their surprise when they found the stone rolled away, and the grave empty. Christians often perplex themselves about that with which they should comfort and encourage themselves. They look rather to find their Master in his grave-clothes, than angels in their shining garments. The angels assure them that he is risen from the dead; is risen by his own power. These angels from heaven bring not any new gospel, but remind the women of Christ's words, and teach them how to apply them. We may wonder that these disciples, who believed Jesus to be the Son of God and the true Messiah, who had been so often told that he must die, and rise again, and then enter into his glory, who had seen him more than once raise the dead, yet should be so backward to believe his raising himself. But all our mistakes in religion spring from ignorance or forgetfulness of the words Christ has spoken. Peter now ran to the sepulchre, who so lately ran from his Master. He was amazed. There are many things puzzling and perplexing to us, which would be plain and profitable, if we rightly understood the words of Christ.</body></html>
