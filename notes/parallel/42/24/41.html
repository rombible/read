As men sleep for sorrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-45.htm" title="And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,">Luke 22:45</a>), so they disbelieve for very joy. What is brought before their eyes is too good to be true.<p><span class= "bld">Have ye here any meat?</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">anything to eat, any food.</span> Here again there is an agreement with St. John (21:5). A new crucial test is given of the reality of the resurrection-body. It could be no shadow or spectre that thus asked for food. This we all feel; but the further question, whether there was not only the power to receive food, but a life in any sense dependent upon the laws which govern the bodily life of men, leads us into a region of problems which we cannot solve, and on which it is profitless to dwell. What seems suggested is a spiritual existence capable, by an act of volition, of assuming, in greater or less measure, the conditions of corporeal. We note how the Apostles dwelt afterwards on what now occurred as a proof of their Lord's resurrection. They had "eaten and drunk with Him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-41.htm" title="Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.">Acts 10:41</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41, 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while</span> <span class="cmt_word">they yet believed not for joy.</span> The awful joy of the disciples <span class="accented">now</span> was something too. deep for words, even for calm belief. St. John records it, too, with simple pathos. "Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord." This was the fulfilment of his promise to them, when, full of sadness, they were listening to him that last solemn Passover evening in the upper room. "Ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>). In after-days, as John preached and taught in his old age, how the remembrance of <span class="accented">that hour</span> must have stirred in his heart when he thus wrote of it! <span class="cmt_word">Have ye here any meat?</span> <span class="cmt_word">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb</span>. The Master would not permit this state of wondering ecstasy to continue; so he changes the current of their thoughts by thus descending into the region of everyday life, at the same time powerfully demonstrating by this further proof that, though changed, his resurrection, body was no mere Docetic semblance, no phantom, but that he could eat if he chose. The next sentence (ver. 43) tells simply how he took the food, and ate before them. The fish and honeycomb which they gave him no doubt formed the staple of their evening meal. Fish was part of the common food of the disciples - we see this from the miracles of the five thousand and the four thousand, and also from the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9</a>. Honey, we know, in Canaan, the laud flowing with milk and honey, was common enough to enter into the diet of the poor (compare, among many passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-9.htm">Deuteronomy 26:9, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:36-49 Jesus appeared in a miraculous manner, assuring the disciples of his peace, though they had so lately forsaken him, and promising spiritual peace with every blessing. Many troublesome thoughts which disquiet our minds, rise from mistakes concerning Christ. All the troublesome thoughts which rise in our hearts at any time, are known to the Lord Jesus, and are displeasing to him. He spake with them on their unreasonable unbelief. Nothing had passed but what was foretold by the prophets, and necessary for the salvation of sinners. And now all men should be taught the nature and necessity of repentance, in order to the forgiveness of their sins. And these blessings were to be sought for, by faith in the name of Jesus. Christ by his Spirit works on the minds of men. Even good men need to have their understandings opened. But that we may have right thoughts of Christ, there needs no more than to be made to understand the Scriptures.</body></html>
