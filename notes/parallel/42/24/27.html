The Lord's proofs of what he asserted he drew from the whole series of writings, rapidly glancing over the long many-coloured roll called the Old Testament. "Jesus had before him a grand field, from the Protevangelium, the first great Gospel of Genesis, down to Malachi. In studying the Scriptures for himself, he had found himself in them everywhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39, 40</a>)' (Godet). <span class="accented">The things concerning himself.</span> The Scriptures which the Lord probably referred to specially were the promise to Eve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>); the promise to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>); the Paschal lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>.); the scapegoat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-1.htm">Leviticus 16:1-34</a>); the brazen serpent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>); the greater Prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>); the star and sceptre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>); the smitten rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>), etc.; Immanuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>); "Unto us a Child is born," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>); the good Shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10, 11</a>); the meek Sufferer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>); he who bore our griefs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4, 5</a>); the Branch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14, 15</a>); the Heir of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>); the Ruler from Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>); the Branch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>); the lowly King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>); the pierced Victim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>); the smitten Shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>); the messenger of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>); the Sun of Righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>); and no doubt many other passages. Dr. Davison, in his book on prophecy, pp. 266-287, shows that there is not one of the prophets without some distinct reference to Christ, except Nahum, Jonah (who was himself a type and prophetic sign), and Habakkuk, who, however, uses the memorable words quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. To these we must add references to several of the psalms, notably to the sixteenth and twenty-second, where sufferings and death are spoken of as Belonging to the perfect picture of the Servant of the Lord and the ideal King. His hearers would know well how strangely the agony of Calvary was foreshadowed in those vivid word-pictures he called before their memories in the course of that six-mile walk from Jerusalem to Emmaus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:13-27 This appearance of Jesus to the two disciples going to Emmaus, happened the same day that he rose from the dead. It well becomes the disciples of Christ to talk together of his death and resurrection; thus they may improve one another's knowledge, refresh one another's memory, and stir up each other's devout affections. And where but two together are well employed in work of that kind, he will come to them, and make a third. Those who seek Christ, shall find him: he will manifest himself to those that inquire after him; and give knowledge to those who use the helps for knowledge which they have. No matter how it was, but so it was, they did not know him; he so ordering it, that they might the more freely discourse with him. Christ's disciples are often sad and sorrowful, even when they have reason to rejoice; but through the weakness of their faith, they cannot take the comfort offered to them. Though Christ is entered into his state of exaltation, yet he notices the sorrows of his disciples, and is afflicted in their afflictions. Those are strangers in Jerusalem, that know not of the death and sufferings of Jesus. Those who have the knowledge of Christ crucified, should seek to spread that knowledge. Our Lord Jesus reproved them for the weakness of their faith in the Scriptures of the Old Testament. Did we know more of the Divine counsels as far as they are made known in the Scriptures, we should not be subject to the perplexities we often entangle ourselves in. He shows them that the sufferings of Christ were really the appointed way to his glory; but the cross of Christ was that to which they could not reconcile themselves. Beginning at Moses, the first inspired writer of the Old Testament, Jesus expounded to them the things concerning himself. There are many passages throughout all the Scriptures concerning Christ, which it is of great advantage to put together. We cannot go far in any part, but we meet with something that has reference to Christ, some prophecy, some promise, some prayer, some type or other. A golden thread of gospel grace runs through the whole web of the Old Testament. Christ is the best expositor of Scripture; and even after his resurrection, he led people to know the mystery concerning himself, not by advancing new notions, but by showing how the Scripture was fulfilled, and turning them to the earnest study of it.</body></html>
