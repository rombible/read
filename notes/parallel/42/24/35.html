The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1Corinthians 10:16</a>), is every way significant. He meant men to connect the recognition at Emmaus with their daily or weekly communion in the Body and Blood of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread</span>. The two travellers now relate to the eleven their wondrous story. The words used by Cleopas and his friend in their narration, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which should be rendered," in the breaking of the bread," are significant. It is an expression which, at the time when St. Luke wrote his Gospel, had acquired a definite meaning in the language of the Christian Church, and was applied to breaking bread in the "Supper of the Lord" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42, 46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>). While they were speaking together, the personal appearance of the Lord was vouchsafed to them; for, of a sudden, he stood in the midst and spoke to them! <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:28-35 If we would have Christ dwell with us, we must be earnest with him. Those that have experienced the pleasure and profit of communion with him, cannot but desire more of his company. He took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. This he did with his usual authority and affection, with the same manner, perhaps with the same words. He here teaches us to crave a blessing on every meal. See how Christ by his Spirit and grace makes himself known to the souls of his people. He opens the Scriptures to them. He meets them at his table, in the ordinance of the Lord's supper; is known to them in breaking of bread. But the work is completed by the opening of the eyes of their mind; yet it is but short views we have of Christ in this world, but when we enter heaven, we shall see him for ever. They had found the preaching powerful, even when they knew not the preacher. Those Scriptures which speak of Christ, will warm the hearts of his true disciples. That is likely to do most good, which affects us with the love of Jesus in dying for us. It is the duty of those to whom he has shown himself, to let others know what he has done for their souls. It is of great use for the disciples of Christ to compare their experiences, and tell them to each other.</body></html>
