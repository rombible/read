Probably the events related in this chapter took place on the Tuesday. The first day of the week, Palm Sunday, was the day of the public entry into the city. The purification of the temple took place on the Monday, on which day also the barren fig tree was cursed. We are now considering the events of the Tuesday. The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is especially a Pauline word; we find it rarely used save in his writings, and of course in those of St. Luke. St. Paul uses it twenty times, and St. Luke twenty-five. <span class="cmt_word">The chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders, and spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things?</span> This appears to have been a formal deputation from the supreme council of the Sanhedrim The three classes here specified represented probably the three great sections of the Sanhedrin - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> priests, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> scribes and rabbis, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Levites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These came upon him evidently with hostile intent, and surrounded him as he was walking in the temple. The jealous anger of the rulers of the Jews had been lately specially excited by the triumphant entry on Palm Sunday, and by the stir and commotion which the presence of Jesus had occasioned in the holy city. And in the last two or three days Jesus had evidently claimed especial power in the temple. He had publicly driven out the money-changers and vendors of sacrificial victims who plied their calling in the sacred courts. He had, in addition, forbade the carrying vessels across the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-16.htm">Mark 11:16</a>), and had allowed the children in the temple, probably those attached to its choir, to shout "Hosanna!" to him as the Messiah. From the point of view of the Sanhedrin, such a question might well have been looked for. His interlocutors made quite sure that Jesus, in reply, would claim having received a Divine commission. Had he made openly such a formal claim in reply to their question, then he would have been cited before the supreme court to give an account of himself and his commission. Then, as they thought, would have been their opportunity to convict him out of his own mouth of blasphemy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-8 Men often pretend to examine the evidences of revelation, and the truth of the gospel, when only seeking excuses for their own unbelief and disobedience. Christ answered these priests and scribes with a plain question about the baptism of John, which the common people could answer. They all knew it was from heaven, nothing in it had an earthly tendency. Those that bury the knowledge they have, are justly denied further knowledge. It was just with Christ to refuse to give account of his authority, to those who knew the baptism of John to be from heaven, yet would not believe in him, nor own their knowledge.</body></html>
