In his mode of reference to the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm" title="Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look on God.">Exodus 3:6</a>, St. Luke agrees with St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-26.htm" title="And as touching the dead, that they rise: have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?">Mark 12:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37, 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush.</span> You Sadducees, in your own arbitrary fashion, set aside the authority of the prophets and all sacred books save the Pentateuch; well, I will argue with you on your own, comparatively speaking, narrow ground - the books of Moses. Even he, Moses, is singularly clear and definite in his teaching on this point of the resurrection, though you pretend he is not. You are acquainted with the well-known section in Exodus termed 'the Bush :' what read you there?" <span class="cmt_word">When he</span> <span class="cmt_word">calleth the Lord the</span> <span class="cmt_word">God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living</span>; more accurately rendered, <span class="accented">not a God of dead beings, but of living beings.</span> The meaning of the Lord's argument is, "God would never have called himself the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, if these patriarchs, after their short lives, had become mere crumbling dust. God cannot be <span class="cmt_word">the</span> God of a being who does not exist." So Josephus - who, however, no doubt drew his argument from these words of Christ, for this strong and conclusive argument from the Pentateuch for the immortality of man does not appear to have occurred to rabbis before the time of our Lord - so Josephus writes: "They who die for God's sake live unto God as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the patriarchs." The expression, "at the bush," should be rendered "in the Bush," that is, in that division of Exodus so named. So the Jews termed <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1.htm">2 Samuel 1</a>. and following verses "the Bow;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. and following section, "the Chariot." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:27-38 It is common for those who design to undermine any truth of God, to load it with difficulties. But we wrong ourselves, and wrong the truth of Christ, when we form our notions of the world of spirits by this world of sense. There are more worlds than one; a present visible world, and a future unseen world; and let every one compare this world and that world, and give the preference in his thoughts and cares to that which deserves them. Believers shall obtain the resurrection from the dead, that is the blessed resurrection. What shall be the happy state of the inhabitants of that world, we cannot express or conceive,</body></html>
