The parable-story <span class="accented">of itself</span> was an improbable one. The conduct of the husbandmen, the long patience of the owner of the vineyard, his last act in sending his beloved and only son, ? all this makes up a history without a parallel in human experience. Yet this is an exact sketch of what did actually take place in the eventful story of Israel! <span class="cmt_word">What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them? He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard</span> <span class="cmt_word">to others.</span> Again a hint of a solemn deliberation in heaven, a prophetic picture of the future of the Jewish race fulfilled with terrible exactness. <span class="cmt_word">And when they heard it, they said, God forbid!</span> Well understood they the Speaker's meaning here. He foreshadowed, in no veiled language, the utter ruin of the Jewish polity. When they heard this, forgetting to be scornful, they exclaimed, in deprecation of the ominous and terrible prediction, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>! which we render accurately, though not literally, "God forbid!" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:9-19 Christ spake this parable against those who resolved not to own his authority, though the evidence of it was so full. How many resemble the Jews who murdered the prophets and crucified Christ, in their enmity to God, and aversion to his service, desiring to live according to their lusts, without control! Let all who are favoured with God's word, look to it that they make proper use of their advantages. Awful will be the doom, both of those who reject the Son, and of those who profess to reverence Him, yet render not the fruits in due season. Though they could not but own that for such a sin, such a punishment was just, yet they could not bear to hear of it. It is the folly of sinners, that they persevere in sinful ways, though they dread the destruction at the end of those ways.</body></html>
