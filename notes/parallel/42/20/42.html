The Hebrew runs thus: "Jehovah said to my Lord (<span class="accented">Adonai</span>)." The Eternal is represented as speaking to Davids Lord, who is also David's Son (this appears clearer in St. Matthew's account, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-41.htm">Matthew 22:41-46</a>). The Eternal addresses this Person as One raised to sit by him, that is, <span class="accented">as a Participator in his all-power</span>, and yet this one is also David's Son! The scribes are asked to explain this mystery; alone this can be done by referring to the golden chain of Hebrew Messianic prophecy; no <span class="accented">scribe in the days of our Lord would do this.</span> Such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, give a complete and exhaustive answer to the question of Jesus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:39-47 The scribes commended the reply Christ made to the Sadducees about the resurrection, but they were silenced by a question concerning the Messiah. Christ, as God, was David's Lord; but Christ, as man, was David's son. The scribes would receive the severest judgement for defrauding the poor widows, and for their abuse of religion, particularly of prayer, which they used as a pretence for carrying on worldly and wicked plans. Dissembled piety is double sin. Then let us beg of God to keep us from pride, ambition, covetousness, and every evil thing; and to teach us to seek that honour which comes from him alone.</body></html>
