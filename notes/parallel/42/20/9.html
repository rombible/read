The presence of this, as well as of the last section, in the first three Gospels, with so little variation, indicates the impression which these facts and teaching made at the time, and probably also that they occupied a prominent place in the early records that served as the basis of our present Gospels.<p><span class= "bld">A certain man planted a vineyard.</span>--The absence of the fuller detail in St. Matthew and St. Mark shows that St. Luke's report was not derived from them, but probably from a version, orally repeated, of that which they reported more fully. On the other hand, the addition of "for a long time" is peculiar to St. Luke, and reminds us of the like phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-19.htm" title="After a long time the lord of those servants comes, and reckons with them.">Matthew 25:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-19.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the wicked husbandmen in the vineyard, and the simile of the corner-stone.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A certain man</span> <span class="cmt_word">planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen.</span> Under a very thin parabolic veil, Jesus foretells the awful tragedy of the next few days. He adopts a well-known imagery, and seems to say, "Listen to Isaiah's well-known story of the vineyard, the vineyard of the Lord of hosts, which is the house of Israel. I will expand it a little, that I may show you how it stands with you as regards this matter of 'authority,' that we may see whether you have as much respect for the ascertained will of God as ye pretend, so that ye should be sure to submit to me if only ye were satisfied that I was an accredited Messenger of God" (Professor Bruce). For a long time. Representing the nearly two thousand years of Jewish history. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:9-19 Christ spake this parable against those who resolved not to own his authority, though the evidence of it was so full. How many resemble the Jews who murdered the prophets and crucified Christ, in their enmity to God, and aversion to his service, desiring to live according to their lusts, without control! Let all who are favoured with God's word, look to it that they make proper use of their advantages. Awful will be the doom, both of those who reject the Son, and of those who profess to reverence Him, yet render not the fruits in due season. Though they could not but own that for such a sin, such a punishment was just, yet they could not bear to hear of it. It is the folly of sinners, that they persevere in sinful ways, though they dread the destruction at the end of those ways.</body></html>
