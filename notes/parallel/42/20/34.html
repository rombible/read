In the form of the answer there are slight variations. The contrast between "the children of this world "or "age," those, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> who belong to it (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a>), and those of "that world" or "age," is peculiar to St. Luke. In both cases the word rests primarily on the idea of time rather than place. It may be noted that no other writer in the New Testament uses the form of words, "<span class= "ital">that</span> world," the age or period that is <span class= "ital">there,</span> not <span class= "ital">here,</span> for the life of the eternal kingdom. The more common phrase is "the world to come" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm" title="And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.">Matthew 12:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-30.htm" title="But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.">Matthew 19:30</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: neither</span> <span class="cmt_word">can they die any more.</span> How different are the few rare pictures which our Master draws of the heaven-life to those painted by the great founders and teachers of other world-wide religions! In his world beyond the grave, while he tells us of a continuing existence, of varied and ever-increasing activity, in contradistinction to the Nirvana of Buddha, in these pictures of Jesus the sensual paradise of Mohammed, for instance, finds no place. Marriage is, according to our Lord's teaching, but a temporary expedient to preserve the human race, to which death would soon put an end. But in the world to come there will be no death and no marriage. We may assume from his words here that the difference between the sexes will have ceased to exist. <span class="cmt_word">They are equal unto the angels</span>. Equal with the angels in being immortal; no death; no marriage. Jesus in this place asserts that angels have a body, but are exempt from any difference of sex. The angels are here introduced because our Lord was speaking with Sadducees, who (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>) denied the existence of these glorious beings. He wished to set the seal of his teaching on the deeply interesting question of the existence of angels. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:27-38 It is common for those who design to undermine any truth of God, to load it with difficulties. But we wrong ourselves, and wrong the truth of Christ, when we form our notions of the world of spirits by this world of sense. There are more worlds than one; a present visible world, and a future unseen world; and let every one compare this world and that world, and give the preference in his thoughts and cares to that which deserves them. Believers shall obtain the resurrection from the dead, that is the blessed resurrection. What shall be the happy state of the inhabitants of that world, we cannot express or conceive,</body></html>
