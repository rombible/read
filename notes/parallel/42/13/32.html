The fact that the Greek word for "fox" is always used as a feminine, gives, perhaps, a special touch of indignant force to the original. He had so identified himself with Herodias that he had lost his manliness, and the proverbial type of the worst form of woman's craft was typical of him.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, I cast out devils.</span>--What was the meaning of the message? What we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-8.htm" title="And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.">Luke 23:8</a>, perhaps, supplies the answer to that question. Herod "hoped to have seen some miracle done by Him," and Jesus, reading his thoughts, tells him that the time for such sights and wonders was all but over. One day, and yet another, and yet a third--so our Lord describes, in proverbial speech (comp. the analogous forms of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-14.htm" title="And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?">Exodus 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-2.htm" title="After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.">Hosea 6:2</a>), an interval of very short duration, and then "I am perfected." The word is strictly a present tense used predictively, and may be either middle or passive in its meaning, the latter being most in harmony with the use of the verb elsewhere. "Then I am brought to the end; then I reach the goal of this human life of Mine." Very noteworthy in connection with this passage is the prominence given to the verb throughout the Epistle to the Hebrews, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-9.htm" title="And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;">Hebrews 5:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that she-fox.</span> The Lord saw through the shallow device, and, in reply to his false friends, bade them go to that intriguing and false court with a message which he would give them, The epithet "she-fox" is perhaps the bitterest and most contemptuous name ever given by the pitiful Master to any of the sons of men. It is possible it might have been intended for Herodias, the influence of that wicked princess being at that time all-powerful at court. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected</span>. "Tell Herod or Herodias that I have a work still to work here; a few more evil spirits to cast out, a few more sick folk to heal. I am going on as I have begun; no message, friendly or unfriendly, will turn me from my purpose. I have no fears of his royal power, but I shall not trouble him long; just to-day and to-morrow - this was merely (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>) a proverbial expression for a short time - and on the third day I complete my work." This completion some have understood by the crowning miracle on dead Lazarus at Bethany, but it is far better to understand it as referring to the Passion, as including the last sufferings, the cross, and the resurrection. The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> here was supplemented by the utterance with which the blessed life came to its close on the cross - <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>! <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> became a recognized term for martyrdom. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 Christ, in calling Herod a fox, gave him his true character. The greatest of men were accountable to God, therefore it became him to call this proud king by his own name; but it is not an example for us. I know, said our Lord, that I must die very shortly; when I die, I shall be perfected, I shall have completed my undertaking. It is good for us to look upon the time we have before us as but little, that we may thereby be quickened to do the work of the day in its day. The wickedness of persons and places which more than others profess religion and relation to God, especially displeases and grieves the Lord Jesus. The judgment of the great day will convince unbelievers; but let us learn thankfully to welcome, and to profit by all who come in the name of the Lord, to call us to partake of his great salvation.</body></html>
