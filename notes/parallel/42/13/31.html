Our Lord's answer, "Go tell that fox . . .," points to the last of these views as the most probable. It is true that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-8.htm" title="And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.">Luke 23:8</a>, we are told that Herod "had desired to see Him of a long season;" but oscillations of vague curiosity and vague fears were quite in keeping with the Tetrarch's character. Accepting the conclusion suggested in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-22.htm" title="And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.">Luke 13:22</a>, that we have here a record of our Lord's Peraean ministry, we may probably connect the message with the fact that His journeys had brought Him near Machaerus, where John had been imprisoned, and in which was one of Herod's most stately palaces (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, vii.</span> 6). Thence the Pharisees may have come with a threat, in which we may possibly trace the hand of Herodias, and which, at least, reminds us of the message sent by Jezebel to Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm" title="Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not your life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.">1Kings 19:2</a>). St. Luke's knowledge of the incident may have been derived from Manaen; or, as Machaerus was famous for hot medicinal springs, and for herbs that had a widespread fame for special virtues (Josephus, as above), it may have been one of the places to which he was attracted by his pursuits as a physician. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-35.</span> - The <span class="accented">message of Jesus to Herod Antipas, and the lament over the loved city of Jerusalem, the destined place of his own death.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee</span>. Very many of the older authorities read here, instead of "tile same day," "in that very hour." This incident connected with Herod Antipas, which is only related by St. Luke, not improbably was communicated to Luke and Paul by Manaen, who was intimately connected with that prince, and who was a prominent member of the primitive Church of Antioch in those days when Paul was beginning his work for the cause (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>). This curious message probably emanated from Herod and Herodias. The tetrarch was disturbed and uneasy at the Lord's continued presence in his dominions, and the crowds who thronged to hear the great Teacher occasioned the jealous and timorous prince grave disquietude. Herod shrank from laying hands on him, though, for the memory of the murdered friend of Jesus was a terrible one, we know, to the superstitious tetrarch, and he dreaded being forced into a repetition of the judicial murder of John the Baptist. It is likely enough that the enemies of the Lord were now anxious for him to go to Jerusalem and its neighbourhood, where he would be in the power of the Sadducean hierarchy, and away from the protection of the Galilaean multitudes, with whom his influence was still very great. The Pharisees, who as a party hated the Master, willingly entered into the design, and under the mask of a pretended friendship warned him of Herod's intentions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 Christ, in calling Herod a fox, gave him his true character. The greatest of men were accountable to God, therefore it became him to call this proud king by his own name; but it is not an example for us. I know, said our Lord, that I must die very shortly; when I die, I shall be perfected, I shall have completed my undertaking. It is good for us to look upon the time we have before us as but little, that we may thereby be quickened to do the work of the day in its day. The wickedness of persons and places which more than others profess religion and relation to God, especially displeases and grieves the Lord Jesus. The judgment of the great day will convince unbelievers; but let us learn thankfully to welcome, and to profit by all who come in the name of the Lord, to call us to partake of his great salvation.</body></html>
