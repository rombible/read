So taken. the words emphatically assert the actual presence of the Kingdom. It was already in the midst of them at the very time when they were asking when it would appear. The use of the Greek preposition is, however, all but decisive against this interpretation. It is employed for that which is "within," as contrasted with that which is "without," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-26.htm" title="You blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.">Matthew 23:26</a>, and in the LXX. version for the "inward parts," or spiritual nature of man, as contrasted with the outward, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-1.htm" title="Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.">Psalm 103:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm" title="For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.">Psalm 109:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm" title="Why my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh.">Isaiah 16:11</a>. It was in that region, in the life which must be born again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>), that men were to look for the kingdom; and there, whether they accepted it or rejected it, they would find sufficient tokens of its power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall they say, Lo here: or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you</span>.

It should be rather understood <span class="accented">in the midst of your ranks</span>; so Meyer and Farrar and others interpret it, <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:20-37 The kingdom of God was among the Jews, or rather within some of them. It was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divine grace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what state the judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Here is shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to the secure and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Roman armies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as is here spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in like manner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and remember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who are marked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.</body></html>
