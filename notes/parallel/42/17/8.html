Yet another aspect of the same truths is found in the later promise of the Lord of the Churches to the servant who watches for His coming, "I will sup with him, and he with Me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-10 It is no abatement of their guilt by whom an offence comes, nor will it lessen their punishment that offences will come. Faith in God's pardoning mercy, will enable us to get over the greatest difficulties in the way of forgiving our brethren. As with God nothing is impossible, so all things are possible to him that can believe. Our Lord showed his disciples their need of deep humility. The Lord has such a property in every creature, as no man can have in another; he cannot be in debt to them for their services, nor do they deserve any return from him.</body></html>
