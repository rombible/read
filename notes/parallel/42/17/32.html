The account of Lot's wife had, however, already been used, or was used shortly afterwards (the date of the Wisdom of Solomon being an unsettled problem), to point a like moral, and the "standing pillar of salt" had become "a monument of an unbelieving soul" (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/10-7.htm" title="Of whose wickedness even to this day the waste land that smoketh is a testimony, and plants bearing fruit that never come to ripeness: and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an unbelieving soul.">Wisdom Of Solomon 10:7</a>). She had looked back, as the disciples were told not to look, and the glance had been fatal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-26.htm" title="But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.">Genesis 19:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:20-37 The kingdom of God was among the Jews, or rather within some of them. It was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divine grace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what state the judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Here is shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to the secure and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Roman armies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as is here spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in like manner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and remember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who are marked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.</body></html>
