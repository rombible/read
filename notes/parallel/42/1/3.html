In such matters the writer, who was avowedly a compiler, might well be at some disadvantage as compared with others.<p><span class= "bld">Most excellent Theophilus.</span>--The adjective is the same as that used of Felix by Tertullus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-3.htm" title="We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.">Acts 24:3</a>), and implies at least high social position, if not official rank. The name, which means "Friend of God," might well be taken by a Christian convert at his baptism. Nothing more can be known of the person so addressed beyond the fact that he was probably a Gentile convert who had already been partially instructed in the facts of the Gospel history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first</span>; more accurately rendered, having followed up (or, investigated) step by step all things from their source. St. Luke, without depreciating the accounts of the life and work of Jesus then current in the Church, here sets out his reasons for undertaking a fresh compilation. His Gospel would differ from the early Gospels: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> By going back much further than they did. It is doubtful if these primitive Gospels began earlier than with the ministry of John and the baptism of Jesus. St. Mark's Gospel - which, perhaps, represents one of the earliest forms of the apostles' preaching and teaching, - does not go further back than those events. St. Luke gave Theophilus, among other early details, a history of the incarnation and the infancy of the Blessed One. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> By presenting the whole story in a consecutive form. Hitherto, apparently, "apostolic tradition probably had a more or less fragmentary character; the apostles not relating every time the whole of the facts, but only those which best answered to the circumstances in which they were preaching. This is expressly said of St. Peter, on the testimony of Papias, or of the old presbyter on whom he relied: <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x31;&#x46;&#x43;&#x30;&#x3b;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ('He chose each time the facts appropriate to the needs of his hearers'). Important omissions would easily result from this mode of telling the great story" (Godet). <span class="cmt_word">Most excellent Theophilus</span>. The term rendered "most excellent" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) denotes that the friend of Luke for whom nominally his Gospel was written was a man of high rank in the Roman world of that day. Nothing is known of his history. He was most likely, from Luke's connection with Antioch, a noble of that great and wealthy city, and may fairly be taken as a representative of that cultured thoughtful class for whom in a measure St. Luke especially wrote. The title <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, by which the Theophilus is here addressed, we find several times applied to high Roman officials, such as Felix and Festus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-26.htm">Acts 23:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-3.htm">Acts 24:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-25.htm">Acts 26:25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4. Luke will not write of things about which Christians may safely differ from one another, and hesitate within themselves; but the things which are, and ought to be surely believed. The doctrine of Christ is what the wisest and best of men have ventured their souls upon with confidence and satisfaction. And the great events whereon our hopes depend, have been recorded by those who were from the beginning eye-witnesses and ministers of the word, and who were perfected in their understanding of them through Divine inspiration.</body></html>
