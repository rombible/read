The word was a favourite one with St. Paul, as in the Greek of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8, Php_2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>. The pity that moved the heart of God is thought of, not as the instrument through which, but that on account of which, the work of the Baptist was to be accomplished.<p><span class= "bld">The dayspring from on high.</span>--The English word expresses the force of the Greek very beautifully. The dawn is seen in the East rising upward, breaking through the darkness. We must remember, however, that the word had acquired another specially Messianic association, through its use in the LXX. version as the equivalent for the "Branch," "that which springs upward," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8</a>. Here the thought of the sunrise is prominent, and it connects itself with such predictions as, "The glory of the Lord hath risen upon thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you.">Isaiah 60:1</a>), "The sun of righteousness shall rise" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm" title="But to you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and you shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.">Malachi 4:2</a>). What had become a Messianic name is taken in its primary sense, and turned into a parable.<p><span class= "bld">Hath visited us.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">hath looked upon us.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 78.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Through the tender mercy of our God</span>. And, goes on Zacharias in his noble hymn, all this tender care for Israel (but really for mankind, though perhaps the speaker of the hymn scarcely guessed it) is owing to the deep love of God<span class="cmt_word">. Whereby the Dayspring from on high hath visited us</span>. The beautiful imagery here is derived from the magnificence of an Eastern sunrise. In his temple service at Jerusalem the priest must have seen the ruddy dawn rise grandly over the dark chain of the distant mountains, and lighting up with a blaze of golden glory the everlasting hills as they stood round about Jerusalem. The thought which pictured the advent of Messiah as a sunrise was a favorite one with the prophets. We see it in such prophecies of Isaiah and Malachi as, "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold... Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of the; rising" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>). "Unto you that fear my Name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in his wings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:67-80 Zacharias uttered a prophecy concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah. The gospel brings light with it; in it the day dawns. In John the Baptist it began to break, and increased apace to the perfect day. The gospel is discovering; it shows that about which we were utterly in the dark; it is to give light to those that sit in darkness, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. It is reviving; it brings light to those that sit in the shadow of death, as condemned prisoners in the dungeon. It is directing; it is to guide our feet in the way of peace, into that way which will bring us to peace at last, Ro 3:17. John gave proofs of strong faith, vigorous and holy affections, and of being above the fear and love of the world. Thus he ripened for usefulness; but he lived a retired life, till he came forward openly as the forerunner of the Messiah. Let us follow peace with all men, as well as seek peace with God and our own consciences. And if it be the will of God that we live unknown to the world, still let us diligently seek to grow strong in the grace of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
