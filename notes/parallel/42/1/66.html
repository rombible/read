The "hand" implies, in the familiar language of the Old Testament (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-15.htm" title="Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.">Judges 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-12.htm" title="Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.">2Chronicles 30:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm" title="For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.">Ezra 7:9</a>), what we more commonly call the "guidance" or the "providence" of God. The phrase was essentially a Hebrew one; one of the vivid anthropomorphic idioms which they could use more boldly than other nations, because they had clearer thoughts of God as not made after the similitude of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 66.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the hand of the Lord was with him</span>. This kind of pause in the history is one of the peculiarities of St. Luke's style. We meet with it several times in the gospel story and in the history of the Acts. They are vivid pictures in a few words of what happened to an individual, to a family, or to a cause, during often a long. course of years. Here the story of the childhood of the great pioneer of Christ is briefly sketched out; in it all, and through it all, there was one guiding hand - the Lord's. The expression, "hand of the Lord," was peculiarly a Hebrew thought - one of the vivid anthropomorphic idioms which, as has been aptly remarked, they could use more boldly than other nations, because they had clearer thoughts of God as not made after the similitude of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>). Maimonides, the great Jewish writer of the twelfth century, in his 'Yad Hachazakah,' says, "And there was under his feet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>); written with the finger of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>); the hand of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>); the eyes of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>); the ears of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-18.htm">Numbers 11:18</a>). All these are used with reference to the intellectual capacity of the sons of men, who can comprehend only corporeal beings; so that the Law spoke in the language of the sons of men, and all these are expressions merely, just as, If I whet my glittering sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>); for has he, then, a sword? or does he slay with a sword? Certainly not: this is only a figure; and thus all are figures" ('Yad,' chapter 1:8). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:57-66 In these verses we have an account of the birth of John the Baptist, and the great joy among all the relations of the family. He shall be called Johanan, or Gracious, because he shall bring in the gospel of Christ, wherein God's grace shines most bright. Zacharias recovered his speech. Unbelief closed his mouth, and believing opened it again: he believers, therefore he speaks. When God opens our lips, our mouths must show forth his praise; and better be without speech, than not use it in praising God. It is said, The hand of the Lord was working with John. God has ways of working on children in their infancy, which we cannot account for. We should observe the dealings of God, and wait the event.</body></html>
