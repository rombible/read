Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/1-10.htm" title="Declare you it not at Gath, weep you not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.">Micah 1:10-15</a>), to the name of the speaker, of his wife, and of his child. In "performing mercy," we find an allusion to John or Jochanan (= "The Lord be merciful"); in "remembering His holy covenant," to the name Zacharias (= "Whom Jehovah remembers"); in the "oath" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-73.htm" title="The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,">Luke 1:73</a>, to that of Elizabeth or Elisheba (= "The oath of my God"). The play upon the words would, of course, be obvious in the original Hebrew (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Aramaic) of the hymn, which we have only in its Greek version.<p><span class= "bld">His holy covenant.</span>--The covenant is clearly that made with Abraham in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>. In thus going back to that as the starting-point of the New Covenant which was to be made in Christ, Zacharias anticipates the teaching of St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-15.htm" title="Brothers, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man cancels, or adds thereto.">Galatians 3:15-19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:67-80 Zacharias uttered a prophecy concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah. The gospel brings light with it; in it the day dawns. In John the Baptist it began to break, and increased apace to the perfect day. The gospel is discovering; it shows that about which we were utterly in the dark; it is to give light to those that sit in darkness, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. It is reviving; it brings light to those that sit in the shadow of death, as condemned prisoners in the dungeon. It is directing; it is to guide our feet in the way of peace, into that way which will bring us to peace at last, Ro 3:17. John gave proofs of strong faith, vigorous and holy affections, and of being above the fear and love of the world. Thus he ripened for usefulness; but he lived a retired life, till he came forward openly as the forerunner of the Messiah. Let us follow peace with all men, as well as seek peace with God and our own consciences. And if it be the will of God that we live unknown to the world, still let us diligently seek to grow strong in the grace of Jesus Christ.</body></html>
