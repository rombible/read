(as in <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/22-21.htm" title="Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair not: for there may be a returning to favour.">Ecclesiasticus 22:21-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/27-21.htm" title="As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling there may be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope.">Ecclesiasticus 27:21</a>), which must be allowed great weight in interpreting a writer like St. Luke, is that of "giving up hope," <span class= "ital">despairing.</span> And this gives, it is obvious, a meaning not less admirable than that of the received version, "Give and lend according to the law of Christ, and do not let the absence of immediate profit make you lose heart and hope." There is a "great reward." The last words at least remind us of the promise made to Abraham, and may be interpreted by it. God Himself is our "exceeding great reward" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm" title="After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.">Genesis 15:1</a>). One or two MSS. give a masculine instead of a neuter pronoun after the verb, and in that case the verb must be taken as transitive. We have accordingly to choose between <span class= "ital">in nothing despairing,</span> or <span class= "ital">driving no man to despair.</span> On the whole, the former seems preferable. So taken, we may compare it with St. Paul's description of "charity" or "love," as "hoping all things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-7.htm" title="Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.">1Corinthians 13:7</a>), and his counsel, "Be not weary in well doing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm" title="And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The children of the Highest.</span>--Better, for the sake of uniformity with the other passages where the word occurs, <span class= "ital">sons of the Most High.</span> The passage is noticeable as the only instance in which our Lord Himself applies this name to the Father.<p><span class= "bld">He is kind.</span>--The generalised word takes the place of the more specific reference to the rain and sunshine as God's gifts to all, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm" title="That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.">Matthew 5:45</a>. The word rendered "kind" is applied to God in the Greek version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-8.htm" title="O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusts in him.">Psalm 34:8</a>, quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>, and is there rendered "gracious."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">your reward shall be great,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and ye shall be the children of the Highest</span>. It has been objected by the enemies of Christianity that, after all, Jesus offered his followers a reward by way of payment to them for their self-sacrificing lives on earth. What, however, is this reward? Is it not a share in that Divine and glorious life of God, who is all love; a hope of participation in that eternal work of his which will go from blessing to blessing, from glory to glory; a certain expectation of dying only to wake up in his likeness, satisfied? The Eternal had already made a similar promise to his faithful servant Abraham. when he bade him fear not, because here on earth God was his Shield, and after death would be his exceeding great Reward. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:27-36 These are hard lessons to flesh and blood. But if we are thoroughly grounded in the faith of Christ's love, this will make his commands easy to us. Every one that comes to him for washing in his blood, and knows the greatness of the mercy and the love there is in him, can say, in truth and sincerity, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Let us then aim to be merciful, even according to the mercy of our heavenly Father to us.</body></html>
