If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.">John 15:20</a>. Here the application of the proverb is obviously very different. The connection of thought is somewhat obscure, and we may not unreasonably believe that some links have been omitted. As it is, however, we can infer something from what precedes and follows. We are still in that section of the discourse which warns the disciples against taking on themselves the office of a judge. They were in this to follow the example of their Master. He, in His work on earth, taught, but did not judge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-11.htm" title="She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more.">John 8:11-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-47.htm" title="And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.">John 12:47</a>; perhaps, also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-14.htm" title="And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?">Luke 12:14</a>). Were they above their Master that they should do what He had refrained from doing?<p><span class= "bld">Every one that is perfect.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">every one that is perfected.</span> The marginal rendering, "Every one shall be perfected," is hardly tenable grammatically The implied thought is that the disciple or scholar who has been perfected by the education through which his Master has led him, will be like the Master in character and temper, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in this special application of the maxim, will abstain from needless, or hasty, or uncharitable judgment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master</span>. "Both," he went on to say, "will be lost hopelessly. You cannot expect the disciples of these mistaken men, surely, to be wiser than their teachers; for you know the oft-repeated saying, 'Every one that is perfect [better rendered, <span class="accented">that has been perfected</span>] shall be as his master;' in other words, the pupils of these censorious, evil-judging, narrow-minded, bitter men will grow up - as they become perfected in this teaching - in their turn equally narrow-minded and bitter as their masters." The conclusion, felt though not expressed, of course, is, "But <span class="accented">my</span> followers must be something different to these; another and nobler spirit, nobler because more generous, must rule in their hearts." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:37-49 All these sayings Christ often used; it was easy to apply them. We ought to be very careful when we blame others; for we need allowance ourselves. If we are of a giving and a forgiving spirit, we shall ourselves reap the benefit. Though full and exact returns are made in another world, not in this world, yet Providence does what should encourage us in doing good. Those who follow the multitude to do evil, follow in the broad way that leads to destruction. The tree is known by its fruits; may the word of Christ be so grafted in our hearts, that we may be fruitful in every good word and work. And what the mouth commonly speaks, generally agrees with what is most in the heart. Those only make sure work for their souls and eternity, and take the course that will profit in a trying time, who think, speak, and act according to the words of Christ. Those who take pains in religion, found their hope upon Christ, who is the Rock of Ages, and other foundation can no man lay. In death and judgment they are safe, being kept by the power of Christ through faith unto salvation, and they shall never perish.</body></html>
