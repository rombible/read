These he purposed to train up as the authorized exponents of his doctrine, and as the future leaders of his Church. Things had assumed a new aspect during the last few months. Jerusalem and the hierarchy, supported by the great teachers of that form of Judaism which for so long a period had swayed the hearts of the people, had, although not yet openly, declared against the views and teaching of Jesus. His acts - but far more his words - had gathered round him, especially in Galilee, in the north and central districts of Palestine, a large and rapidly increasing following. It was necessary that some steps should be taken at once to introduce among the people who had received his words gladly, some kind of organization; hence the formal choice of the twelve, who from henceforth stood nearest to him. We possess the following four lists of these twelve men: - <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-2.htm">Matthew 10:2-4</a>.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Simon <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Andrew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Philip <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Bartholomew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thomas <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Matthew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James of Alphaeus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lebbaeus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Simon the Kananite <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Judas Iscariot <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16-19</a>.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Simon <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Andrew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Philip <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Bartholomew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Matthew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thomas <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James of Alphaeus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thaddaeus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Simon the Kananite <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Judas Iscariot <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-14.htm">Luke 6:14-16</a>.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Simon <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Andrew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Philip <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Bartholomew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Matthew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thomas <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James of Alphaeus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Simon Zelotes <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Judas of James <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Judas Iscariot <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peter <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Andrew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Philip <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thomas <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Bartholomew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Matthew <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James of Alphaeus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Simon Zelotes <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Judas of James <span class="cmt_word">He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-19 We often think one half hour a great deal to spend in meditation and secret prayer, but Christ was whole nights engaged in these duties. In serving God, our great care should be not to lose time, but to make the end of one good duty the beginning of another. The twelve apostles are here named; never were men so privileged, yet one of them had a devil, and proved a traitor. Those who have not faithful preaching near them, had better travel far than be without it. It is indeed worth while to go a great way to hear the word of Christ, and to go out of the way of other business for it. They came to be cured by him, and he healed them. There is a fulness of grace in Christ, and healing virtue in him, ready to go out from him, that is enough for all, enough for each. Men regard the diseases of the body as greater evils than those of their souls; but the Scripture teaches us differently.</body></html>
