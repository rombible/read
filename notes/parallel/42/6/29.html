Our Lord, for instance, himself did not offer himself to be stricken again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22, 23</a>), but firmly, though with exquisite courtesy, rebuked the one who struck him. St. Paul, too (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>), never dreamed of obeying the letter of this charge. It is but an assertion of a great principle, and so, with the exception of a very few mistaken fanatics, all the great teachers of Christianity have understood it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:27-36 These are hard lessons to flesh and blood. But if we are thoroughly grounded in the faith of Christ's love, this will make his commands easy to us. Every one that comes to him for washing in his blood, and knows the greatness of the mercy and the love there is in him, can say, in truth and sincerity, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Let us then aim to be merciful, even according to the mercy of our heavenly Father to us.</body></html>
