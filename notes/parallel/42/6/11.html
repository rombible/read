The thought-leaders of the Jews - the men whose position was secured as long as the rabbinic teaching held sway in the hearts of the people, but no longer - from this hour resolved upon the death of that strange mighty Reformer. He was, said they, an impostor, a fanatic; one who led men's minds astray. Had they no doubts, we ask; no qualms of conscience, no deep searchings of heart?
