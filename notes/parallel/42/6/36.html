The well-known passage in Shakespeare on the "quality of mercy," is, perhaps, the best comment on this verse (<span class= "ital">Merchant of Venice,</span> iv. 1).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful</span>. "Yes," goes on the Master, "be ye kind, tender-hearted, merciful; stop not short at the easier love, but go on to the harder; and do this because God does it even to the unthankful and evil" (ver. 35). On this attribute of the mercy of the Most High, James, who had evidently drunk deep of the wisdom contained in this great discourse of his so-called brother, speaks of the Lord as "very pitiful, and of tender mercy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:27-36 These are hard lessons to flesh and blood. But if we are thoroughly grounded in the faith of Christ's love, this will make his commands easy to us. Every one that comes to him for washing in his blood, and knows the greatness of the mercy and the love there is in him, can say, in truth and sincerity, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Let us then aim to be merciful, even according to the mercy of our heavenly Father to us.</body></html>
