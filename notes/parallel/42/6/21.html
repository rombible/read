The law implied is obviously the same as before. Fulness of bread, a life abounding in comforts and luxuries, like that of the Rich Man in the parable of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-19.htm" title="There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:">Luke 16:19</a>, tends to dull the edge of appetite for higher things. Those who know what the hunger of the body is, can understand better, and are more likely to feel, the hunger of the soul.<p><span class= "bld">Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</span>--The clause is remarkable as being (with its counterpart in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-25.htm" title="Woe to you that are full! for you shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.">Luke 6:25</a>) the only instance in the New Testament of the use of "laughter" as the symbol of spiritual joy. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-9.htm" title="Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.">James 4:9</a> it comes in as representing worldly gladness; but the Greek word was too much associated with the lower forms of mirth to find ready acceptance. It is probable that the Aramaic word which our Lord used, like the mirth or laughter which entered into the name of Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-6.htm" title="And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.">Genesis 21:6</a>), had a somewhat higher meaning. Hebrew laughter was a somewhat graver thing than that of Greek or Roman. It had had no comedy to degrade it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled</span>. A similar question probably to the one suggested above, brought out the addition reported in St. Matthew's account - " after righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh</span>. There is a mourning which, as Augustine says, has no blessing from heaven attached to it, at best only a sorrow of this world and for the things of this world. What Jesus speaks of is a nobler grief', a weeping for our sins and the sins of others, for our weary exile here. This is "the only instance," writes Dean Plumptre, "in the New Testament of the use of 'laughter' as the symbol of spiritual joy .... The <span class="accented">Greek</span> word was too much associated with the lower forms of mirth .... It is probable that the Aramaic word which our Lord doubtless used here had a somewhat higher meaning. Hebrew laughter was a somewhat graver thing than that of Greek or Roman. Comedy was unknown among the Hebrew people." It is observable that we read of our Lord weeping. His joy is mentioned, and his sorrow. He sympathized with all classes and orders, talked with them, even ate and drank with them; but we never read that he laughed. There was a tradition in the early Church that Lazarus, after he rose from the dead, was never seen again to smile. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:20-26 Here begins a discourse of Christ, most of which is also found in Mt 5; 7. But some think that this was preached at another time and place. All believers that take the precepts of the gospel to themselves, and live by them, may take the promises of the gospel to themselves, and live upon them. Woes are denounced against prosperous sinners as miserable people, though the world envies them. Those are blessed indeed whom Christ blesses, but those must be dreadfully miserable who fall under his woe and curse! What a vast advantage will the saint have over the sinner in the other world! and what a wide difference will there be in their rewards, how much soever the sinner may prosper, and the saint be afflicted here!</body></html>
