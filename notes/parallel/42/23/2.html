The question asked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/20-20.htm" title="And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.">Luke 20:20-26</a>, was obviously intended to lead up to this; and though then baffled by our Lord's answer, the priests now brought, backed by false witnesses, the charge for which they had hoped to find evidence in His own words. It seems probable that these facts came to the writer's knowledge in the same way as those that immediately follow. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-6.htm" title="When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.">Luke 23:6</a>.) It may be noted that the charge in the Greek is slightly enlarged. The question had referred, as reported by St. Matthew and St. Mark, to one form of tribute--the <span class= "ital">census,</span> or poll-tax. The charge speaks of "taxes" in the plural, and uses the most general words. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-22.htm" title="Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?">Luke 20:22</a> the same word is used as in this verse, but in the singular. St. Paul, in a passage which may well have been based upon St. Luke's report of our Lord's words, uses the same term as St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/13-6.htm" title="For for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually on this very thing.">Romans 13:6-7</a>), first generically in the plural, and then in the singular as contrasted with customs duties.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting</span> <span class="cmt_word">the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself Christ a King.</span> To understand this scene perfectly <span class="cmt_word"></span> we must read St. John's account in his eighteenth chapter (ver. 28 and following). From the place of meeting of the Sanhedrin, Jesus was led to the palace of Pilate, the Prsetorium. The Roman governor was evidently prepared for the case; for application must have been made to him the evening before for the guard which arrested Jesus in Gethsemane. St. John tells us that the delegates of the Sanhedrin entered not into the hall of judgment, "lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the Passover." Pilate, who knew well from his past experience how fiercely these fanatics resented any slight offered to their religious feelings, wishing for his own purposes to conciliate them, went outside. These Jews, prior to eating the Passover, would not enter any dwelling from which all leaven had not been carefully removed; of course, this had not been the case in the palace of Pilate. The governor asks them, in St. John's account, what was their accusation against the Man. They replied that they had three charges: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> he had perverted the nation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> he had forbidden that tribute should be given to Caesar; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he had asserted that he was Christ a King. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-5 Pilate well understood the difference between armed forces and our Lord's followers. But instead of being softened by Pilate's declaration of his innocence, and considering whether they were not bringing the guilt of innocent blood upon themselves, the Jews were the more angry. The Lord brings his designs to a glorious end, even by means of those who follow the devices of their own hearts. Thus all parties joined, so as to prove the innocence of Jesus, who was the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</body></html>
