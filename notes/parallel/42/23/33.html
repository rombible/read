As a matter of translation, it would clearly have been better either to give the Greek form (<span class= "ital">Cranion</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> or its meaning (= "skull") in English. The Vulgate, however, had given <span class= "ital">Calvarium,</span> and that word had taken so strong a hold on men's minds, that it was apparently thought better, as in all the English versions, to retain it here. It is not without interest to note that the name which more than any other is associated with Protestant hymns and meditations on the atonement, should come to us from the Vulgate of the Latin Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-49.</span> - <span class="accented">The Crucifixion.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary;</span> literally, <span class="accented">unto the place which is called the skull.</span> The familiar name "Calvary" has its origin in the Vulgate translation, <span class="accented">Calvarium</span>, a skull. The name "Place of a skull," <span class="accented">Golgotha</span> (properly <span class="accented">Gulgoltha, an</span> Aramaic word <span class="aramaic">&#x5e0;&#x5dc;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span>, corresponding to the Hebrew <span class="accented">Gulgoleth</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5ea;</span>, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35</a> is translated "skull"), does not come from the fact that the skulls of condemned persons remained lying there, but it is so called from being a bare rounded mound like a skull in form. Dean Plumptre suggests that the spot in question was chosen by the Jewish rulers as a deliberate insult to one of their own order, Joseph of Arima-thaea, whose garden, with its rock-sepulchre, lay hard by. A later legend derives the name from its being the burying-place of Adam, and that as the blood flowed from the sacred wounds on his skull, his soul was translated to Paradise. A tradition traceable to the fourth century has identified this spot with the building known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. St. Cyril of Jerusalem alludes to the spot repeatedly. In the time of Eusebius there was no doubt as to the site. The Bordeaux Pilgrim (A.D. 333) writes thus: "On the left side (of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre) is the hillock (<span class="accented">monticulus</span>) Golgotha, where the Lord was crucified. Thence about a stone-throw distance is the crypt where his body was deposited." Recent research confirms this very ancient tradition, and scholars are generally now agreeing that the evidence in support of the <span class="accented">traditional site</span> is strong and seemingly conclusive<span class="cmt_word">. And the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left</span>. St. John adds, "and Jesus in the midst," as holding the position of preeminence in that scene of uttermost shame. Even in suffering Christ appears as a King. Westcott thus comments on the next detail recorded by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-19.htm">John 19:19</a>), where the accurate rendering is, "And Pilate wrote a title <span class="accented">also."</span> This title (see further, ver. 38) was drawn up by Pilate, who caused it to be placed on the cross. The words, "wrote a title also," perhaps imply that the placing of the Lord in the midst was done by Pilate's direction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:32-43 As soon as Christ was fastened to the cross, he prayed for those who crucified him. The great thing he died to purchase and procure for us, is the forgiveness of sin. This he prays for. Jesus was crucified between two thieves; in them were shown the different effects the cross of Christ would have upon the children of men in the preaching the gospel. One malefactor was hardened to the last. No troubles of themselves will change a wicked heart. The other was softened at the last: he was snatched as a brand out of the burning, and made a monument of Divine mercy. This gives no encouragement to any to put off repentance to their death-beds, or to hope that they shall then find mercy. It is certain that true repentance is never too late; but it is as certain that late repentance is seldom true. None can be sure they shall have time to repent at death, but every man may be sure he cannot have the advantages this penitent thief had. We shall see the case to be singular, if we observe the uncommon effects of God's grace upon this man. He reproved the other for railing on Christ. He owned that he deserved what was done to him. He believed Jesus to have suffered wrongfully. Observe his faith in this prayer. Christ was in the depth of disgrace, suffering as a deceiver, and not delivered by his Father. He made this profession before the wonders were displayed which put honour on Christ's sufferings, and startled the centurion. He believed in a life to come, and desired to be happy in that life; not like the other thief, to be only saved from the cross. Observe his humility in this prayer. All his request is, Lord, remember me; quite referring it to Jesus in what way to remember him. Thus he was humbled in true repentance, and he brought forth all the fruits for repentance his circumstances would admit. Christ upon the cross, is gracious like Christ upon the throne. Though he was in the greatest struggle and agony, yet he had pity for a poor penitent. By this act of grace we are to understand that Jesus Christ died to open the kingdom of heaven to all penitent, obedient believers. It is a single instance in Scripture; it should teach us to despair of none, and that none should despair of themselves; but lest it should be abused, it is contrasted with the awful state of the other thief, who died hardened in unbelief, though a crucified Saviour was so near him. Be sure that in general men die as they live.</body></html>
