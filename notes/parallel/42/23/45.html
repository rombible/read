This was the inner veil, which hung between the holy place and the holy of holies. It was rich with costly embroidery, and very heavy. Before the willing surrender of life told of in the next versa (46), our Lord spoke twice more. These fifth and sixth words from the cross are preserved by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28, 30</a>). The first of these, "I <span class="accented">thirst</span> " - an expression of bodily exhaustion, of physical suffering - was predicted as part of the agony of the Servant of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>). The second, "It <span class="accented">is finished</span>!" tells that "the earthly life had been carried to its issue. That every essential point in the prophetic portraiture of Messiah had been realized. The last suffering for sin had been endured. The end of all had been gained. Nothing was left undone or unborne" (Westcott). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:44-49 We have here the death of Christ magnified by the wonders that attended it, and his death explained by the words with which he breathed out his soul.

Let us seek to glorify God by true repentance and conversion; by protesting against those who crucify the Saviour; by a sober, righteous, and godly life; and by employing our talents in the service of Him who died for us and rose again.</body></html>
