Simon the Cyrenian. The daughters of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as they led him away</span>. Plutarch tells us that every criminal condemned to crucifixion carried his own cross. There was borne in front of him, or else hung round his own neck, a white tablet, on which the crime for which he suffered was inscribed. Possibly this was what was afterwards affixed to the cross itself. <span class="cmt_word">Simon, a Cyrenian</span>. Cyrene was an important city in North Africa, with a large colony of resident Jews. These Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue of their own in Jerusalem. It is probable that Simon was a Passover pilgrim. St. Mark tells us he was the father of "Alexander and Rufus;" evidently, from his mention of them, these were notable persons in the early Christian Church. Very likely their connection with the followers of Jesus dated from this incident on the road to Calvary. <span class="cmt_word">Coming out of the country.</span> He was probably one of the pilgrims lodged in a village near Jerusalem, and met the sad procession as he was entering the city on his way to the temple. <span class="cmt_word">On him they laid the cross.</span> Our Lord was weakened by the trouble and agitation of the past sleepless night, and was, of course, faint and utterly exhausted from the effects of the terrible scourging. The cross used for this mode of execution was (1)either the <span class="accented">Cruz decussata <span class="cmt_word"></span>X</span>, what is usually known as St. Andrew's cross; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Cruz commissa</span> <span class="cmt_word">T</span>, St. Anthony's cross; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the ordinary Roman cross <span class="cmt_word">&dagger;</span>, <span class="accented">Cruz immissa.</span> Our Lord suffered on the third description, the Roman cross. This consisted of two pieces, the one perpendicular (<span class="accented">staticulum</span>), the other horizontal (<span class="accented">antenna</span>). About the middle of the first was fastened a piece of wood (<span class="accented">sedile</span>), on which the condemned rested. This was necessary, else, during the long torture, the weight of the body would have torn the hands, and the body would have fallen. The cross was not very high, scarcely twice the height of an ordinary man. Strong nails were driven through the hands and feet. The victim usually lived about twelve hours, sometimes much longer. The agonies endured by the crucified have been thus summarized: "The fever which soon set in produced a burning thirst. The increasing inflammation of the wounds in the back, hands, and feet; the congestion of the blood in the head, lungs, and heart; the swelling of every vein, an indescribable oppression, racking pains in the head; the stiffness of the limbs, caused by the unnatural position of the body; - these all united to make the punishment, in the language of Cicero ('In Verr.,' 5:64), <span class="accented">crudelissimum teterrimumque supplicium.</span> From the beginning Jesus had foreseen that such would be the end of his life." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:26-31 We have here the blessed Jesus, the Lamb of God, led as a lamb to the slaughter, to the sacrifice. Though many reproached and reviled him, yet some pitied him. But the death of Christ was his victory and triumph over his enemies: it was our deliverance, the purchase of eternal life for us. Therefore weep not for him, but let us weep for our own sins, and the sins of our children, which caused his death; and weep for fear of the miseries we shall bring upon ourselves, if we slight his love, and reject his grace. If God delivered him up to such sufferings as these, because he was made a sacrifice for sin, what will he do with sinners themselves, who make themselves a dry tree, a corrupt and wicked generation, and good for nothing! The bitter sufferings of our Lord Jesus should make us stand in awe of the justice of God. The best saints, compared with Christ, are dry trees; if he suffer, why may not they expect to suffer? And what then shall the damnation of sinners be! Even the sufferings of Christ preach terror to obstinate transgressors.</body></html>
