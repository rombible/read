A reed shaken with the wind?">Matthew 11:7-19</a>. The two narratives agree very closely. The few variations will be noticed as they occur.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John</span>. When the messengers of John were departed, the Lord, fearful lest the people who had been standing by and listening to the question which the Baptist had put, and his answer, should entertain any disparaging thought of a great and sorely tried saint of God, spoke the following noble testimony concerning that true, faithful witness. It has been termed the funeral oration of John; for not long after it had been spoken he was put to death by Herod Antipas. <span class="cmt_word">What</span> <span class="cmt_word">went ye out into the wilderness for to see</span> A <span class="cmt_word">reed shaken with the wind?</span> The imagery was taken from the scenery in the midst of which John the Baptist had principally exercised his ministry - the reedy banks of Jordan. It was surely to see an everyday sight - a weak vacillating man blown to and fro with every wind. John, though his faith failed him for a moment perhaps, was no wavering reed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:19-35 To his miracles in the kingdom of nature, Christ adds this in the kingdom of grace, To the poor the gospel is preached. It clearly pointed out the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, that the messenger he sent before him to prepare his way, did it by preaching repentance and reformation of heart and life. We have here the just blame of those who were not wrought upon by the ministry of John Baptist or of Jesus Christ himself. They made a jest of the methods God took to do them good. This is the ruin of multitudes; they are not serious in the concerns of their souls. Let us study to prove ourselves children of Wisdom, by attending the instructions of God's word, and adoring those mysteries and glad tidings which infidels and Pharisees deride and blaspheme.</body></html>
