In details we note (1) that St. Luke unites the "Bethphage" of St. Matthew with the "Bethany" of St. Mark; (2) that, as a stranger to Judaea, he speaks of the "mountain <span class= "ital">that was called</span> the Mount of Olives. Possibly, indeed, both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-37.htm" title="And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and stayed in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.">Luke 21:37</a>, as certainly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm" title="Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.">Acts 1:12</a>, he uses the Greek equivalent for Olivet (the Latin <span class= "ital">Olivetum,</span> or "place of Olives") as a proper name. The absence of the article before the Greek for "Olives," and the accentuation of the words in many MSS., seem decisive in favour of this view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when he was come nigh</span> <span class="cmt_word">to Bethphage and Bethany.</span> Bethphage is never mentioned in the Old Testament, but in the Talmud we find it specified in some interesting ceremonial directions. It was evidently an outlying suburb of Jerusalem. Bethphage, which lay between the city and Bethany, was by the rabbis legally counted as part of Jerusalem. Bethany signifies" House of Dates," no doubt so called from its palm trees. Bethphage, "House of Green Figs," from its fig-orchards. The modern Bethany is known as <span class="accented">El-Azarieh</span> or <span class="accented">Lazarieh</span>, the name attaching to its connection with the history of Lazarus. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:28-40 Christ has dominion over all creatures, and may use them as he pleases. He has all men's hearts both under his eye and in his hand. Christ's triumphs, and his disciples' joyful praises, vex proud Pharisees, who are enemies to him and to his kingdom. But Christ, as he despises the contempt of the proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble. Pharisees would silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot; for as God can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham, and turn the stony heart to himself, so he can bring praise out of the mouths of children. And what will be the feelings of men when the Lord returns in glory to judge the world!</body></html>
