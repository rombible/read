Too much stress has, perhaps, been laid on its supposed force as indicating self-assertion in both cases. It does not seem to imply more than that Zacchaeus, in his own house, hearing the murmurs of those who looked in at doors or windows, rose from his couch, and stood up, and in the hearing of all, said what follows. The phrase, "unto the Lord," indicates, as elsewhere, that the facts were recorded by St. Luke at a comparatively late period. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-11.htm" title="And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.">Luke 7:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The half of my goods I give</span> . .--It seems more natural to see in this the statement of a new purpose than that of an habitual practice. In the absence of any words implying a command of this nature, we must assume either that it was a spontaneous impulse of large-hearted devotion, or, possibly, that Zacchaeus had heard of the command given but a few days before to the young ruler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-22.htm" title="Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, Yet lack you one thing: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.">Luke 18:22</a>). The promise implies immediate distribution. The compensation for wrongs that men might have suffered at his hands was to come out of the remaining half.<p><span class= "bld">If I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation.</span>--The seven words of the English text are all needed to express the one Greek word, the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-14.htm" title="And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.">Luke 3:14</a>, where see Note. It is a pity that English usage, and the modern meaning of the words, do not allow us to say, "If I have <span class= "ital">sycophanted</span> any man." Conscience probably reproached Zacchaeus with not a few of such acts of spoliation in the past. The Greek phrase, "If I have taken anything," hardly implies doubt as to the fact, and is used like our English "wherever."<p><span class= "bld">I restore him fourfold.</span>--Here, also, it seems best to recognise in the words a new purpose. He is ready to compensate now for whatever wrong had been done before. There seems, indeed, something almost ludicrously incongruous in a devout man boasting that his rule of life is to make amends to those whom he deliberately cheats, and the special force of the verb practically excludes the idea of involuntary wrong.<p>The Law required in cases of voluntary restitution the addition of one-fifth of the value of the thing restored (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm" title="Or all that about which he has sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it to him to whom it appertains, in the day of his trespass offering.">Leviticus 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/5-6.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;">Numbers 5:6-7</a>).<p>The whole force of the history seems lost if we suppose Zacchaeus, as some have done, to have been a model of a virtuous publican before he sought to see Jesus. On that supposition his words are like those of the Pharisee in the parable, a self-righteous boast. The strivings of repentance must, indeed, have begun before, and the man, when he welcomed our Lord's presence, and trusted His words, was "justified by faith." Is it too utterly bold a conjecture that He who saw Nathanael under the fig-tree (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-48.htm" title="Nathanael said to him, From where know you me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.">John 1:48</a>), had seen Zacchaeus in the Temple, and that the figure in the parable of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-14.htm" title="I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.">Luke 18:14</a>, was in fact a portrait?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Zacchaeus stood, and said</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</span> Zacchaeus's memorable speech was addressed not as an <span class="accented">apologia</span> to the murmuring, jealous crowd, either in the room or the courtyard of the house, but to his Divine Guest, who, he felt, understood him, whose great heart, he knew, sympathized with him in that life of his, so tempted and yet so full of quiet, noble acts; for the chief publican's words do not refer to a <span class="accented">future</span> purpose, but they speak of a <span class="accented">past</span> rule of life which he had set for himself to follow, and probably had followed for a long period. So Godet, who paraphrases thus: "He whom thou hast thought good to choose as thy host is not, as is alleged, a being unworthy of thy choice. Lo, publican though I am, it is no ill-gotten gain with which I entertain thee." In a profession like his, it was easy to commit involuntary injustice. There may, too, have been, probably was, many a hard if not an unjust act worked by the chief of the tax-gatherers and his subordinates in their difficult employment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Those who sincerely desire a sight of Christ, like Zaccheus, will break through opposition, and take pains to see him. Christ invited himself to Zaccheus' house. Wherever Christ comes he opens the heart, and inclines it to receive him. He that has a mind to know Christ, shall be known of him. Those whom Christ calls, must humble themselves, and come down. We may well receive him joyfully, who brings all good with him. Zaccheus gave proofs publicly that he was become a true convert. He does not look to be justified by his works, as the Pharisee; but by his good works he will, through the grace of God, show the sincerity of his faith and repentance. Zaccheus is declared to be a happy man, now he is turned from sin to God. Now that he is saved from his sins, from the guilt of them, from the power of them, all the benefits of salvation are his. Christ is come to his house, and where Christ comes he brings salvation with him. He came into this lost world to seek and to save it. His design was to save, when there was no salvation in any other. He seeks those that sought him not, and asked not for him.</body></html>
