The broken form of the sentence, "If thou hadst known . . .," with no corresponding clause as to what would then have followed; the "at least in this thy day," the day that was still its own, in which it was called to repentance and action, all point to the words as being the utterance of the deepest human sorrow that the Son of Man had known.<p><span class= "bld">The things which belong unto thy peace.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the things that make for,</span> or <span class= "ital">tend to, peace.</span> The Greek is the same as that translated "conditions of peace" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-32.htm" title="Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an ambassador, and desires conditions of peace.">Luke 14:32</a> (where see Note); in this case, obviously, the "things that make for peace" are repentance, reformation, righteousness.<p><span class= "bld">Now they are hid.</span>--The Greek tense implies, by a distinction hard to express in English, in conjunction with the adverb "now," that the concealment of the things that made for the peace of Jerusalem, was a thing completed in the past.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou hadst known,' even thou, at least in this thy day</span>. The emphatic repetition of the "thou" and the broken form of the sentence, tell of the intense feeling of the Divine Speaker. "In this thy day." There was still time, still one day left, before his terrible trial-time began, Which filled up the measure of Jerusalem and her people's iniquity. <span class="accented">Still one day</span> in which, had they only known "the things which belonged to their peace," they might have won a forgiveness for all the past centuries of sin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:41-48 Who can behold the holy Jesus, looking forward to the miseries that awaited his murderers, weeping over the city where his precious blood was about to be shed, without seeing that the likeness of God in the believer, consists much in good-will and compassion? Surely those cannot be right who take up any doctrines of truth, so as to be hardened towards their fellow-sinners. But let every one remember, that though Jesus wept over Jerusalem, he executed awful vengeance upon it. Though he delights not in the death of a sinner, yet he will surely bring to pass his awful threatenings on those who neglect his salvation. The Son of God did not weep vain and causeless tears, nor for a light matter, nor for himself. He knows the value of souls, the weight of guilt, and how low it will press and sink mankind. May he then come and cleanse our hearts by his Spirit, from all that defiles. May sinners, on every side, become attentive to the words of truth and salvation.</body></html>
