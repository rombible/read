The chief publican was clearly not popular, and probably the priestly tone of the place (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-5.htm" title="And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at your house.">Luke 19:5</a>) gave additional strength to all caste feelings. We are carried forward in this verse from the promise to the performance. Our Lord was in the house when the murmurs found expression.<span class= "bld"><p>With a man that is a sinner.</span>--The term was obviously used from the popular Pharisaic stand-point, as attaching necessarily to the calling of Zacchaeus. He had placed Himself on a level with the heathen or the vilest Jew, and ought to be treated accordingly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They all murmured</span>. This very inclusive statement, "they all," shows the general intensely Jewish spirit of the age, narrow and sectarian. The people could not imagine goodness, or earnestness, or generosity in one who served the hateful Roman power. Probably in priestly Jericho this stern exclusive spirit was especially dominant. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Those who sincerely desire a sight of Christ, like Zaccheus, will break through opposition, and take pains to see him. Christ invited himself to Zaccheus' house. Wherever Christ comes he opens the heart, and inclines it to receive him. He that has a mind to know Christ, shall be known of him. Those whom Christ calls, must humble themselves, and come down. We may well receive him joyfully, who brings all good with him. Zaccheus gave proofs publicly that he was become a true convert. He does not look to be justified by his works, as the Pharisee; but by his good works he will, through the grace of God, show the sincerity of his faith and repentance. Zaccheus is declared to be a happy man, now he is turned from sin to God. Now that he is saved from his sins, from the guilt of them, from the power of them, all the benefits of salvation are his. Christ is come to his house, and where Christ comes he brings salvation with him. He came into this lost world to seek and to save it. His design was to save, when there was no salvation in any other. He seeks those that sought him not, and asked not for him.</body></html>
