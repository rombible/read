Now He was followed by a crowd,, gathering strength as they journeyed on, and roused, by their very nearness to the Holy City, to an almost uncontrollable excitement. The time for delay, they thought, had come to an end. He was about to claim the throne of His father David. The Kingdom of God would "immediately appear." The parable shows us, and was, in part, meant to teach them, how the Master regarded the dreams of the disciples.<p><span class= "bld">Should immediately appear.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">should be shown forth,</span> or <span class= "ital">manifested.</span> The Greek word is not used by any other New Testament writer. It is clear, from the tenor of the parable, that disciples and multitude were alike dwelling on the greatness to which they were to attain, on the high places in store for them on the right hand and on the left, rather than on their work and their duties in relation to that Kingdom of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">parable of the pounds.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as they heard these things, he</span> <span class="cmt_word">added and spake a parable.</span> The words which introduce this parable-story indicate its close connection with the events which had just taken place. "He added, and spake (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</span> Thus were briefly stated the reasons which determined the Master to speak the following parable. First, "he was nigh to Jerusalem," only at most a few hours' journey from the holy city - his last solemn, awful visit, when the mysterious act of stupendous love would be accomplished. So he determined to give a veiled parabolic picture of himself and of his chosen people. Second, "they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear." In his parable he proposed to moderate the wild romantic enthusiasm of his immediate followers and of the Passover crowds by painting for them a quiet picture of the future of work and waiting which lay before them. The parable contains three sets of lessons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The varieties of reward apportioned to different degrees of zeal and industry in the Master's service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The eternity of loss and shame which will be the portion of the slothful and unfaithful servant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The terrible doom of his enemies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:11-27 This parable is like that of the talents, Mt 25. Those that are called to Christ, he furnishes with gifts needful for their business; and from those to whom he gives power, he expects service. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, 1Co 12:7. And as every one has received the gift, so let him minister the same, 1Pe 4:10. The account required, resembles that in the parable of the talents; and the punishment of the avowed enemies of Christ, as well as of false professors, is shown. The principal difference is, that the pound given to each seems to point out the gift of the gospel, which is the same to all who hear it; but the talents, distributed more or less, seem to mean that God gives different capacities and advantages to men, by which this one gift of the gospel may be differently improved.</body></html>
