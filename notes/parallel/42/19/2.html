Rabbinic writers mention a Zacchaeus as living at Jericho about this time, the father of a famous Rabbi, Jochanan or John.<p><span class= "bld">The chief among the publicans.</span>--The position of Jericho near the fords of the Jordan made it a natural trade-centre for the imports from the Gilead country--myrrh and balsam. Under the government of Herod and Archelaus it had become once more a city of palm-trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>), and their dates and palm-honey were probably liable to an <span class= "ital">octroi</span> duty. The "farming" system adopted in the Roman revenue probably gave Zacchaeus the <span class= "ital">status</span> of a middle-man or sub-contractor between the great capitalists of the equestrian order at Rome, the real <span class= "ital">publicani,</span> and the "publicans" commonly so called, who were the actual collectors. As such he had as abundant opportunities for enriching himself as a Turkish pacha, and, as we may infer from his own words, had probably not altogether escaped the temptations of his calling.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Those who sincerely desire a sight of Christ, like Zaccheus, will break through opposition, and take pains to see him. Christ invited himself to Zaccheus' house. Wherever Christ comes he opens the heart, and inclines it to receive him. He that has a mind to know Christ, shall be known of him. Those whom Christ calls, must humble themselves, and come down. We may well receive him joyfully, who brings all good with him. Zaccheus gave proofs publicly that he was become a true convert. He does not look to be justified by his works, as the Pharisee; but by his good works he will, through the grace of God, show the sincerity of his faith and repentance. Zaccheus is declared to be a happy man, now he is turned from sin to God. Now that he is saved from his sins, from the guilt of them, from the power of them, all the benefits of salvation are his. Christ is come to his house, and where Christ comes he brings salvation with him. He came into this lost world to seek and to save it. His design was to save, when there was no salvation in any other. He seeks those that sought him not, and asked not for him.</body></html>
