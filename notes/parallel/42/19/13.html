Here we begin with equality; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-15.htm" title="And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.">Matthew 25:15</a> the servants start with unequal amounts, "according to their several ability." So far as we lay stress on the difference, it implies that the trust in this case is that which all disciples of Christ have in common--<span class= "ital">viz.,</span> their knowledge of the truth and their membership in the Kingdom, and not the offices and positions that vary in degree. The <span class= "ital">pound,</span> or <span class= "ital">mna,</span> was, in Greek numismatics, not a coin, but a sum equal to the sixtieth part of a talent. The Greek name was probably derived from the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Maneh.</span> According to another estimate it was equal to 25 shekels, or 100 <span class= "ital">drachm??</span> or <span class= "ital">denarii.</span> The word meets us, as far as the New Testament is concerned, in this parable only.<p><span class= "bld">Occupy till I come.</span>--The better MSS. give, "while I am coming." The Greek verb for "occupy" occurs in this passage only in the New Testament. A compound form of it is rendered, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.">Luke 19:15</a>, by "gained in trading." The English verb meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm" title="The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm" title="Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making: they occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.">Ezekiel 27:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/27-21.htm" title="Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with you in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they your merchants.">Ezekiel 27:21-22</a>, in the sense of "trading," in which it is used here. (See also the Prayer Book version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm" title="They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;">Psalm 107:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till</span> <span class="cmt_word">I come.</span> No doubt when our Lord spoke these parables he considerably enlarged the details, made many parts of the framework clearer than the short reports which we possess can possibly do. The meaning of the great noble's action here is that he wished to test his servants - to try their various capabilities and dispositions, intending, when he should return from his long journey, having received his kingdom, to appoint them to high offices in the administration, to such positions, in fact, as their action in regard to the small deposit now entrusted to them should show themselves capable of filling. The Greek verb rendered "occupy" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) occurs here only in the New Testament: a compound form of it is rendered (ver. 15) by "gained by trading." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:11-27 This parable is like that of the talents, Mt 25. Those that are called to Christ, he furnishes with gifts needful for their business; and from those to whom he gives power, he expects service. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, 1Co 12:7. And as every one has received the gift, so let him minister the same, 1Pe 4:10. The account required, resembles that in the parable of the talents; and the punishment of the avowed enemies of Christ, as well as of false professors, is shown. The principal difference is, that the pound given to each seems to point out the gift of the gospel, which is the same to all who hear it; but the talents, distributed more or less, seem to mean that God gives different capacities and advantages to men, by which this one gift of the gospel may be differently improved.</body></html>
