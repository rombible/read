There are, however, many noticeable differences in detail. At the outset we have the new feature of the nobleman going "into a far country to receive a kingdom." This had an obvious starting-point in the recent history of Judaea. Both the Tetrarch Antipas and Archelaus, on the death of their father, had gone to Rome to submit their claims to the kingdom to the decision of Augustus (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 9, ?? 3, 4). The Greek for "nobleman" is not the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-46.htm" title="So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.">John 4:46</a>, where the word means a "king's officer." Here it is simply a "man of noble family." In the interpretation of the parable we may see a prophetic announcement by our Lord of His own departure to the "far country," that lay behind the veil, to receive His Kingdom, and of His subsequent return.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He said therefore, A certain noblemen went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return</span>. There was a singular fitness in the Master's choice of a framework for his parable, which at first sight would seem strange and unreal. Two nobles, Herod and Archelaus, in that age had literally gone from Jericho, where the Speaker of the parable-story then was, to a far country across the sea - to Rome, to receive a kingdom from Caesar (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:14; 17:9). And one of these two nobles, Archelaus, had rebuilt the stately royal palace of Jericho, under the very shadow of which the Speaker and the crowds were perhaps standing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:11-27 This parable is like that of the talents, Mt 25. Those that are called to Christ, he furnishes with gifts needful for their business; and from those to whom he gives power, he expects service. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, 1Co 12:7. And as every one has received the gift, so let him minister the same, 1Pe 4:10. The account required, resembles that in the parable of the talents; and the punishment of the avowed enemies of Christ, as well as of false professors, is shown. The principal difference is, that the pound given to each seems to point out the gift of the gospel, which is the same to all who hear it; but the talents, distributed more or less, seem to mean that God gives different capacities and advantages to men, by which this one gift of the gospel may be differently improved.</body></html>
