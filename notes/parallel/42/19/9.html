In one sense salvation had come in the personal presence of the Saviour, but we must remember all that the word implied--deliverance, not from the penalty only, but from the habit and the power of sin. This had come, and the words and acts of Zacchaeus showed the fruits. And it comes to him because "he also is a child of Abraham." The Abraham character was in him, as that of the true Israel was in Nicodemus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-47.htm" title="Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!">John 1:47</a>). A son of Abraham, like him in his noble generosity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-9.htm" title="Is not the whole land before you? separate yourself, I pray you, from me: if you will take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.">Genesis 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-23.htm" title="That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich:">Genesis 14:23</a>), was found where, to the common observer, it would have seemed as hopeless to look for one as among the stones of the Jordan valley (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation</span> <span class="cmt_word">come to this house.</span> This solemn announcement on the part of the Redeemer was something more than a mere comforting assurance to a man who, in spite of difficulties and temptations, had striven manfully to lead a brave and generous life, helping, it is clear, the very multitude who were so ready to revile him. It is an assurance to the world that men might work in <span class="accented">any</span> profession or calling, and at the same time live a life pleasing to God. It repeats with intense emphasis - and this is the great lesson of this striking scene - that it is never the work or the position in life which ennobles the man in the sight of God, but only the way in which the work <span class="accented">is done</span>, and the position <span class="accented">used</span>, which are of price in his pure eyes. The hated publican at the receipt of custom - the servant of Rome, might so live as to win the smile of God, as well as the priest in the sanctuary, or the rabbi in his theological school<span class="cmt_word">. He also is a son of Abraham.</span> That is to say, a spiritual son - a son in the highest and most real sense. Zacchaeus was a faithful follower of Abraham, in his life and in his faith. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Those who sincerely desire a sight of Christ, like Zaccheus, will break through opposition, and take pains to see him. Christ invited himself to Zaccheus' house. Wherever Christ comes he opens the heart, and inclines it to receive him. He that has a mind to know Christ, shall be known of him. Those whom Christ calls, must humble themselves, and come down. We may well receive him joyfully, who brings all good with him. Zaccheus gave proofs publicly that he was become a true convert. He does not look to be justified by his works, as the Pharisee; but by his good works he will, through the grace of God, show the sincerity of his faith and repentance. Zaccheus is declared to be a happy man, now he is turned from sin to God. Now that he is saved from his sins, from the guilt of them, from the power of them, all the benefits of salvation are his. Christ is come to his house, and where Christ comes he brings salvation with him. He came into this lost world to seek and to save it. His design was to save, when there was no salvation in any other. He seeks those that sought him not, and asked not for him.</body></html>
