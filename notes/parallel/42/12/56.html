Were they blind to the bitter, irreconcilable hatred to mighty Rome which was seething scarcely beneath the surface of Jewish society? Were they deaf to the rumbling noises which too surely heralded a fierce and bloody war between little Palestine, split up into parties and sects, and the mighty world of Rome which had seized them in its own grip?

Many in Israel knew that man was indeed a great prophet of the Lord.

And now - they had listened to him who was speaking to them. He had told them all; no sign of power was wanting to his ministry, and it was just over, and the people had not repented. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:54-59 Christ would have the people to be as wise in the concerns of their souls as they are in outward affairs.
