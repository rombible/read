Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:">Matthew 6:28-33</a>. There are, however, some noticeable variations, as (1) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-27.htm" title="Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.">Luke 12:27</a>, in the better MSS., <span class= "ital">they spin not, they weave not;</span> (2) the use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-29.htm" title="And seek not you what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, neither be you of doubtful mind.">Luke 12:29</a> of a new verb, "Neither be ye of doubtful mind." The word is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, and is so far characteristic of St. Luke's special culture. But its etymology and its classical use make it equivalent to "Be not tossed to and fro like a ship out on the open sea;" and so taken, it presents a parallel to St. James's description of the "man that wavereth," as "like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">James 1:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:22-40 Christ largely insisted upon this caution not to give way to disquieting, perplexing cares, Mt 6:25-34. The arguments here used are for our encouragement to cast our care upon God, which is the right way to get ease. As in our stature, so in our state, it is our wisdom to take it as it is. An eager, anxious pursuit of the things of this world, even necessary things, ill becomes the disciples of Christ. Fears must not prevail; when we frighten ourselves with thoughts of evil to come, and put ourselves upon needless cares how to avoid it. If we value the beauty of holiness, we shall not crave the luxuries of life. Let us then examine whether we belong to this little flock. Christ is our Master, and we are his servants; not only working servants, but waiting servants. We must be as men that wait for their lord, that sit up while he stays out late, to be ready to receive him. In this Christ alluded to his own ascension to heaven, his coming to call his people to him by death, and his return to judge the world. We are uncertain as to the time of his coming to us, we should therefore be always ready. If men thus take care of their houses, let us be thus wise for our souls. Be ye therefore ready also; as ready as the good man of the house would be, if he knew at what hour the thief would come.</body></html>
