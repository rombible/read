Here the words come as an answer to Peter's question. The promise was spoken, not for the Twelve only, but for every faithful and wise steward. The words are as the germ of the parable which sets forth the wisdom, though not the faithfulness, of the Unjust Steward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8-10</a>). If wisdom and prudence alone deserved the praise there bestowed on it, what would be due to wisdom and faithfulness united? In St. Paul's words, "It is required in stewards that a man be found faithful" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.">1Corinthians 4:2</a>), we may, perhaps, recognise one of the many traces left on his Epistles by the companionship of St. Luke. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 42-44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath</span>. Jesus goes on with his discourse. <span class="accented">Apparently</span> he pays no heed to Peter's question, but <span class="accented">really</span> he answers it fully, giving in fact more details on the subject of rewards to the faithful in the life to come than even Peter's question required. "Who then," asks the Lord, "is that faithful and wise steward, whom <span class="accented">his</span> lord shall make ruler ever his household?" Who? Peter must answer the question. <span class="accented">This</span> steward should be Peter himself and each of Peter's chosen companions. <span class="accented">This</span> high position of steward in the household of the Lord should be filled by those whom Jesus had specially chosen. If, when he came again, the Lord found <span class="accented">these</span> faithful to their solemn trust, then <span class="accented">these</span> should receive a still higher and grander recompense even than that inconceivably splendid reward (mentioned in ver. 37) which had so struck Peter; and the higher recompense which these, the faithful and wise stewards, should then receive would be <span class="accented">the being made rulers over all that the Lord hath.</span> The answer of the Master then told Peter that all his followers, if found true and loyal, should receive the reward promised (in ver. 37) to the watching servants, who in the world to come would be not the <span class="accented">servants</span> but the <span class="accented">friends</span> of God. While the <span class="accented">few</span>, the chosen apostles of the Lord, if <span class="accented">they</span> endured to the end, if <span class="accented">they</span> were found wise and faithful, to them would be given in the new life a yet more glorious recompense; they would be set in some special position of government and dominion in the glorious city of God. This teaches, too, indirectly, but with great clearness, that in the heaven-life <span class="accented">all</span> Christ's redeemed will enjoy in the friendship of God a perfect blessedness. Still, in that perfect blessedness which will be the heritage of all the redeemed, there will still be degrees in glory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:41-53 All are to take to themselves what Christ says in his word, and to inquire concerning it. No one is left so ignorant as not to know many things to be wrong which he does, and many things to be right which he neglects; therefore all are without excuse in their sin. The bringing in the gospel dispensation would occasion desolations. Not that this would be the tendency of Christ's religion, which is pure, peaceable, and loving; but the effect of its being contrary to men's pride and lusts. There was to be a wide publication of the gospel. But before that took place, Christ had a baptism to be baptized with, far different from that of water and the Holy Spirit. He must endure sufferings and death. It agreed not with his plan to preach the gospel more widely, till this baptism was completed. We should be zealous in making known the truth, for though divisions will be stirred up, and a man's own household may be his foes, yet sinners will be converted, and God will be glorified.</body></html>
