And they said, No; but we will abide in the street all night.">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-27.htm" title="And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:">Genesis 19:27</a>; Song <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-12.htm" title="Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give you my loves.">Song of Solomon 7:12</a>; and figuratively, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-5.htm" title="If you would seek to God betimes, and make your supplication to the Almighty;">Job 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-3.htm" title="From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but you have not listened.">Jeremiah 25:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/6-14.htm" title="Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors.">Wisdom Of Solomon 6:14</a>. It may be that the general statement thus given includes the fourth and fifth days of the week of the Passion, but it is remarkable that all three Gospels are silent as to anything that happened on those days till we come to the Paschal Supper. We may, perhaps, reverently conjecture that they were spent by our Lord, in part at least, in Gethsemane (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-2.htm" title="And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.">John 18:2</a>), in prayer and meditation, in preparing Himself and the disciples for the coming trials of the Passion. Possibly, also, the narrative of the Woman taken in Adultery, which occupies so strangely doubtful a position in St. John's Gospel, may find its true place here. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-1.htm" title="Jesus went to the mount of Olives.">John 8:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:29-38 Christ tells his disciples to observe the signs of the times, which they might judge by. He charges them to look upon the ruin of the Jewish nation as near. Yet this race and family of Abraham shall not be rooted out; it shall survive as a nation, and be found as prophesied, when the Son of man shall be revealed. He cautions them against being secure and sensual. This command is given to all Christ's disciples, Take heed to yourselves, that ye be not overpowered by temptations, nor betrayed by your own corruptions. We cannot be safe, if we are carnally secure. Our danger is, lest the day of death and of judgment should come upon us when we are not prepared. Lest, when we are called to meet our Lord, that be the furthest from our thoughts, which ought to be nearest our hearts. For so it will come upon the most of men, who dwell upon the earth, and mind earthly things only, and have no converse with heaven. It will be a terror and a destruction to them. Here see what should be our aim, that we may be accounted worthy to escape all those things; that when the judgements of God are abroad, we may not be in the common calamity, or it may not be that to us which it is to others. Do you ask how you may be found worthy to stand before Christ at that day? Those who never yet sought Christ, let them now go unto him; those who never yet were humbled for their sins, let them now begin; those who have already begun, let them go forward and be kept humbled. Watch therefore, and pray always. Watch against sin; watch in every duty, and make the most of every opportunity to do good. Pray always: those shall be accounted worthy to live a life of praise in the other world, who live a life of prayer in this world. May we begin, employ, and conclude each day attending to Christ's word, obeying his precepts, and following his example, that whenever he comes we may be found watching.</body></html>
