We note in it, as such, that, as far as the New Testament is concerned, St. Luke only uses the words for "overcharged" and "surfeiting" (the latter word belonged, more or less, to the vocabulary of medical science); St. Luke and St. Paul alone those for "drunkenness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-21.htm" title="Contentions, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.">Galatians 5:21</a>), and cares "of this life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?">1Corinthians 6:3-4</a>), and "unawares" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1Thessalonians 5:3</a>). In the last passage we have what reads almost like a distinct echo from this verse. The whole passage, it may be noted, falls in with St. Luke's characteristic tendency to record all portions of our Lord's teaching that warned men against sensuality and worldliness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And take heed to yourselves</span>. The Master ended his discourse with an earnest practical reminder to his disciples to live ever with the sure expectation of his return to judgment. As for those who heard him then, conscious of the oncoming doom of the city, temple, and people, with the solemn procession of signs heralding the impending ruin ever before their eyes, no passions or cares of earth surely would hinder <span class="accented">them</span> from living the brave, pure life worthy of his servants. As for coming generations - for the warning voice of Jesus here is equally addressed to them - they too must watch for another and far more tremendous ruin falling upon their homes than ever fell upon Jerusalem. The attitude of his people in every age must be that of the "watcher" <span class="accented">till he come.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:29-38 Christ tells his disciples to observe the signs of the times, which they might judge by. He charges them to look upon the ruin of the Jewish nation as near. Yet this race and family of Abraham shall not be rooted out; it shall survive as a nation, and be found as prophesied, when the Son of man shall be revealed. He cautions them against being secure and sensual. This command is given to all Christ's disciples, Take heed to yourselves, that ye be not overpowered by temptations, nor betrayed by your own corruptions. We cannot be safe, if we are carnally secure. Our danger is, lest the day of death and of judgment should come upon us when we are not prepared. Lest, when we are called to meet our Lord, that be the furthest from our thoughts, which ought to be nearest our hearts. For so it will come upon the most of men, who dwell upon the earth, and mind earthly things only, and have no converse with heaven. It will be a terror and a destruction to them. Here see what should be our aim, that we may be accounted worthy to escape all those things; that when the judgements of God are abroad, we may not be in the common calamity, or it may not be that to us which it is to others. Do you ask how you may be found worthy to stand before Christ at that day? Those who never yet sought Christ, let them now go unto him; those who never yet were humbled for their sins, let them now begin; those who have already begun, let them go forward and be kept humbled. Watch therefore, and pray always. Watch against sin; watch in every duty, and make the most of every opportunity to do good. Pray always: those shall be accounted worthy to live a life of praise in the other world, who live a life of prayer in this world. May we begin, employ, and conclude each day attending to Christ's word, obeying his precepts, and following his example, that whenever he comes we may be found watching.</body></html>
