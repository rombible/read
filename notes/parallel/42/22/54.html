It seems that he and his son-in-law Caiaphas, the Roman nominee, occupied together the high priest's palace. There were three trials of our Lord by the Jews: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Before Annas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-12.htm">John 18:12-18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Before Caiaphas and what has been termed a committee of the Sanhedrm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-65</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Formally before the whole Sanhedrin at dawn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-66.htm">Luke 22:66-71</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-1.htm">Mark 15:1</a>). The thrice-repeated denial of Peter took place: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> On his first going in (he was admitted through the influence of John, who was known to the officials) to the court-yard of the high priest's palace, in answer to the female servant who kept the door (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-17.htm">John 18:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As he sat by the fire warming himself, in answer to another maid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-69.htm">Matthew 26:69</a>) and to other bystanders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-25.htm">John 18:25</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-58.htm">Luke 22:58</a>), including the kinsman of Malchus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-26.htm">John 18:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> About an hour later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-59.htm">Luke 22:59</a>), after he had left the fire to avoid the questioners, and had gone out into the porch or gateway leading into the court-yard, in answer to one of the maids who had spoken before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-69.htm">Mark 14:69</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16.htm">Matthew 16</a>:71), and to other bystanders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-59.htm">Luke 22:59</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-70.htm">Mark 14:70</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:54-62 Peter's fall was his denying that he knew Christ, and was his disciple; disowning him because of distress and danger. He that has once told a lie, is strongly tempted to persist: the beginning of that sin, like strife, is as the letting forth of water. The Lord turned and looked upon Peter. 1. It was a convincing look. Jesus turned and looked upon him, as if he should say, Dost thou not know me, Peter? 2. It was a chiding look. Let us think with what a rebuking countenance Christ may justly look upon us when we have sinned. 3. It was an expostulating look. Thou who wast the most forward to confess me to be the Son of God, and didst solemnly promise thou wouldest never disown me! 4. It was a compassionate look. Peter, how art thou fallen and undone if I do not help thee! 5. It was a directing look, to go and bethink himself. 6. It was a significant look; it signified the conveying of grace to Peter's heart, to enable him to repent. The grace of God works in and by the word of God, brings that to mind, and sets that home upon the conscience, and so gives the soul the happy turn. Christ looked upon the chief priests, and made no impression upon them as he did on Peter. It was not the mere look from Christ, but the Divine grace with it, that restored Peter.</body></html>
