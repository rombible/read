In the Greek the other pronoun also is emphatic. "It was <span class= "ital">I</span> who prayed for thee." The prayer was answered, and the words that follow assume the answer as certain. In one sense "faith" did "fail" when the disciple denied his Lord; but repentance came after it, and a new power was gained through that weakness to make others strong. The word for "strengthen" does not meet us in the other Gospels, but is used frequently by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1Thessalonians 3:2</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and twice by St. Peter himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1Peter 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-12.htm" title="Why I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth.">2Peter 1:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not</span>. The prayer of Satan <span class="accented">apparently</span> was not refused. Jesus, however, says, that <span class="accented">for one</span> of that loved company, who he knew from his peculiar temperament was in especial peril, <span class="accented">he had prayed.</span> The prayer was answered thus: the temptation came to all the apostles; all fell; Peter, though, more disastrously by far than his brethren, but the result of the fall was not hopeless despair as in the case of Judas, but bitter remorse and a brave manly repentance. "It is said by Roman divines (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Maldonatus, a Lapide, and Mai, here) that this prayer and precept of our Lord extends to all bishops of Rome as St. Peter's <span class="accented">successors</span>, and that in speaking to St. Peter our Lord spoke to them. Would they be willing to complete the parallel, and say that the bishops of Rome specially need prayer, because they deny Christ? Let them not take a part of it and leave the rest" (Bishop Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">When thou art converted</span>. "Converted" must not be understood here in its technical sense; it should rather be translated, "And thou, when thou hast turned (<span class="accented">i.e</span>. to God) strengthen thy brethren." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:21-38 How unbecoming is the worldly ambition of being the greatest, to the character of a follower of Jesus, who took upon him the form of a servant, and humbled himself to the death of the cross! In the way to eternal happiness, we must expect to be assaulted and sifted by Satan. If he cannot destroy, he will try to disgrace or distress us. Nothing more certainly forebodes a fall, in a professed follower of Christ, than self-confidence, with disregard to warnings, and contempt of danger. Unless we watch and pray always, we may be drawn in the course of the day into those sins which we were in the morning most resolved against. If believers were left to themselves, they would fall; but they are kept by the power of God, and the prayer of Christ. Our Lord gave notice of a very great change of circumstances now approaching. The disciples must not expect that their friends would be kind to them as they had been. Therefore, he that has a purse, let him take it, for he may need it. They must now expect that their enemies would be more fierce than they had been, and they would need weapons. At the time the apostles understood Christ to mean real weapons, but he spake only of the weapons of the spiritual warfare. The sword of the Spirit is the sword with which the disciples of Christ must furnish themselves.</body></html>
