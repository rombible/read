The other two reports give "He blessed," instead of "He gave thanks." There is, of course, no real difference between them. Thanksgiving and blessing both entered into what we may call the Jewish "Grace," and were so far convertible terms. It is noticeable that St. Paul's account, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:">1Corinthians 11:23</a>, agrees on this point with St. Luke's.<p><span class= "bld">Which is given for you.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">which is now in the act of being given.</span> The sacrifice was already inchoate in will. St. Paul's report omits the participle.<p><span class= "bld">This do in remembrance of me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">as My memorial,</span> or, <span class= "ital">as your memorial of Me.</span> The words are common to St. Luke and St. Paul, but are not found in the other two reports. The word for "remembrance" occurs, in the New Testament, only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-3.htm" title="But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.">Hebrews 10:3</a>. In the Greek version of the Old Testament it is applied to the shew-bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-7.htm" title="And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 24:7</a>), to the blowing of trumpets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm" title="Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.">Numbers 10:10</a>), in the titles of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-1.htm" title="O lord, rebuke me not in your wrath: neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.">Psalm 38:1</a> ("to bring to remembrance,") and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/70-1.htm" title="MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.">Psalm 70:1</a>. The word had thus acquired the associations connected with a religious memorial, and might be applied to a sacrifice as commemorative, though it did not in itself involve the idea of sacrificing. The fact that our Lord and His disciples had been eating of a sacrifice which was also a memorial, gives a special force to the words thus used. In time to come, they were to remember Him as having given Himself, sacrificed Himself, for them, and this was to be the memorial in which memory was to express itself, and by which it was to be quickened. It may be noted that the early Liturgies, as a rule, follow St. Luke's report, attaching the word "memorial" sometimes to the bread, sometimes to the cup, sometimes to both.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gays unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you</span>. Around these words, and the parallel passages in SS. Matthew and Mark, for more than a thousand years fierce theological disputes have raged. Men have gone gladly to prison and to death rather than renounce what they believed to be the true interpretation. Now, a brief exegetical commentary is not the place to enter into these sad controversies. It will be sufficient here to indicate some of the lines of thought which the prayerful earnest reader might wisely follow out so as to attain certain just ideas respecting the blessed rite here instituted - ideas which may suffice for a practical religious life. Now, we possess a Divine commentary on this sacrament instituted by our Lord. It is noticeable that St. John, whose Gospel was the latest or well-nigh the latest of the canonical writings of the New Testament, when at great length he relates the story of the last Passover evening and its teaching, does not allude to the institution of that famous service, which, when he wrote his Gospel, had become part of the settled experience of Church life. He <span class="accented">presupposes</span> it; for it had passed then into the ordinary life of the Church. In another and earlier portion of his Gospel, however, St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-58</a>) gives us a record of the Lord's discourse in the synagogue of Capernaum, in which Jesus, while speaking plainly to those who heard him at the time, gave by anticipation a commentary on the sacrament which he afterwards instituted. The truth which was taught in thin discourse is presented in a specific act and in a concrete form in the Holy Communion. In the fifty-third verse of that sixth chapter we read, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." How is this now to be done? We reply that our Lord has clothed these ideas and brought them near to us in this sacrament; while, by his teaching in the sixth chapter of St. John, he guards this sacrament from being regarded on the one hand as an end in itself, or on the other as a mere symbol. Certain truths, great <span class="accented">landmarks</span> laid down in this discourse, have to be borne in mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The separation of the flesh of the Son of man into flesh and blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53</a>) presupposes a violent death submitted to for the sake of others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Both these elements, the flesh and the blood, are to be appropriated individually by the believer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-56.htm">John 6:56</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> How appropriated? St. Bernard well answers the question which he asks: "What is it to eat his flesh and to drink his blood, but to <span class="accented">share in his sufferings and to imitate the life he lived when with us in the flesh?"</span> (St. Bernard, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>). "If ye suffer with him, ye shall also reign with him." The Holy Eucharist is from one point of view a great truth dramatized, instituted for the purpose of bringing before men in a vivid manner the great truths above alluded to. <span class="accented">But it is something more.</span> It brings to the believer, to the faithful communicant, to the one who in humble adoring faith carries out to the best of his ability his Master's dying charge - it brings a blessing too great for us to measure by earthly language, too deep for us to fathom with human inquiry. For the partaking of this Holy Communion is, first, the Christian's solemn public confession of his faith in Christ crucified; his solemn private declaration that it is his deliberate wish to suffer with his Lord and for his Lord's sake; that it is, too, his firm purpose to imitate the earthly life lived by his Lord. The partaking of this Holy Communion, too, is the Christian's most solemn prayer for strength thus to suffer and to live. It is, too, his fervent expression of belief that this strength will be surely given to him. Further, the partaking of this Holy Communion is, above all, the Christian's most solemn prayer for living union with Christ - "that Christ may dwell in his heart by faith." It is, too, his fervent expression of belief that "then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us; we are one with. Christ, and Christ with us." This confession, declaration, and prayer he constantly renews in obedience to the dying command of his Master. It is difficult to understand how any belief in a physical change in the elements of bread and wine, such as is involved in the theory of transubstantiation held in the Roman Church, or of consubstantiation in the Lutheran community, can be supposed to enhance the reverence of the communicant, or to augment the blessing promised. The words of the Lord, "This is my body... my blood," cannot surely be pressed, seeing that the same Divine Speaker was in his discourses in the habit of using imagery which could not literally be pressed, such as "I am the Bread of life," "I am the Door of the sheep," "I am the true Vine," etc. Nothing that can be conceived is more solemn than the simple rite, more awful in its grandeur, more Divine and far-reaching in its promises to the faithful believer. Human imaginings add nothing to this Divine mystery, which is connected at once with the Incarnation and the Atonement. They only serve to envelop it in a shroud of earth-born mist and cloud, and thus to dim if not to veil its Divine glory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:19,20 The Lord's supper is a sign or memorial of Christ already come, who by dying delivered us; his death is in special manner set before us in that ordinance, by which we are reminded of it. The breaking of Christ's body as a sacrifice for us, is therein brought to our remembrance by the breaking of bread. Nothing can be more nourishing and satisfying to the soul, than the doctrine of Christ's making atonement for sin, and the assurance of an interest in that atonement. Therefore we do this in rememberance of what He did for us, when he died for us; and for a memorial of what we do, in joining ourselves to him in an everlasting covenant. The shedding of Christ's blood, by which the atonement was made, is represented by the wine in the cup.</body></html>
