The feast so named commemorated the manner in which the chosen people were spared in Egypt when the destroying angel of the Lord passed over all Israelitish houses, which had been sprinkled with the blood of the lamb, <span class="accented">without</span> slaying the firstborn. Dr. Farrar suggests that the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span> is a transliteration, with a sort of alliterative allusion to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, "I suffer." This greatest and most important of the Jewish feasts, which ever brought a great host of pilgrims to Jerusalem, was kept in the first month of the Jewish year (Nisan), from the 15th of the month, the day of full moon, to the 21st. Roughly, this corresponded to the end of our March. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-6 Christ knew all men, and had wise and holy ends in taking Judas to be a disciple. How he who knew Christ so well, came to betray him, we are here told; Satan entered into Judas. It is hard to say whether more mischief is done to Christ's kingdom, by the power of its open enemies, or by the treachery of its pretended friends; but without the latter, its enemies could not do so much evil as they do.</body></html>
