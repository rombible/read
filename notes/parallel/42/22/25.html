Antiochus VII. of Syria, and Ptolemy III. of Egypt, were examples of kings who had borne the title of <span class= "ital">Euergetes,</span> or benefactor. There is apparently an emphasis on "are called" as contrasted with "let him become," in the next verse. The world gave the title of "benefactor" to those who were great in power only. In Christ's kingdom true greatness was to be attained by benefiting others in the humblest services.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are</span> <span class="cmt_word">called benefactors</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>).

In the way to eternal happiness, we must expect to be assaulted and sifted by Satan. If he cannot destroy, he will try to disgrace or distress us. Nothing more certainly forebodes a fall, in a professed follower of Christ, than self-confidence, with disregard to warnings, and contempt of danger. Unless we watch and pray always, we may be drawn in the course of the day into those sins which we were in the morning most resolved against. If believers were left to themselves, they would fall; but they are kept by the power of God, and the prayer of Christ. Our Lord gave notice of a very great change of circumstances now approaching. The disciples must not expect that their friends would be kind to them as they had been. Therefore, he that has a purse, let him take it, for he may need it. They must now expect that their enemies would be more fierce than they had been, and they would need weapons. At the time the apostles understood Christ to mean real weapons, but he spake only of the weapons of the spiritual warfare. The sword of the Spirit is the sword with which the disciples of Christ must furnish themselves.</body></html>
