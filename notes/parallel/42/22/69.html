The narrative of St. Matthew shows that the change of purpose or of action was caused by the solemn adjuration of the high priest, which no longer left Him the alternative of silence. The form of the answer, too, is somewhat altered. Not "ye shall see," but simply "shall be sitting," as though the dominant thought in St. Luke's mind in reporting the words was that even in the agony and death that were so soon to come on Him, our Lord found Himself glorified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm" title="And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.">John 12:23</a>). The Cross was-His Throne, and while hanging on it, He was in spirit sitting at the right hand of the Father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 69.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the power of God.</span> Jesus decided to put an end to this weary and useless trial, and supplied his judges with the evidence they were seeking to extort from him. The Master's words would recall to the teachers of Israel, sitting as his judges, the words of their loved prophet Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>). These solemn words of his were, and they perfectly understood them as such, a claim on the part of the Prisoner who stood before them - <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">direct claim to Divine glory.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:63-71 Those that condemned Jesus for a blasphemer, were the vilest blasphemers. He referred them to his second coming, for the full proof of his being the Christ, to their confusion, since they would not admit the proof of it to their conviction. He owns himself to be the Son of God, though he knew he should suffer for it. Upon this they ground his condemnation. Their eyes being blinded, they rush on. Let us meditate on this amazing transaction, and consider Him who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself.</body></html>
