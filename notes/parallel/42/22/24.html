The noun which he uses for "strife" does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, but the corresponding adjective meets us in the "contentious" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-16.htm" title="But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.">1Corinthians 11:16</a>. The dispute was apparently the sequel of many previous debates of the same kind, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-46.htm" title="Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.">Luke 9:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-1.htm" title="At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?">Matthew 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-34.htm" title="But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.">Mark 9:34</a>; and the prayer of the two sons of Zebedee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not my to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.">Matthew 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-37.htm" title="They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and the other on your left hand, in your glory.">Mark 10:37</a>). What had just passed probably led to its revival. Who was greatest? Was it Peter, to whom had been promised the keys of the kingdom, or John, who reclined on the Master's bosom, or Andrew, who had been first-called? Even the disciples who were in the second group of the Twelve, might have cherished the hope that those who had been thus rebuked for their ambition or their want of faith had left a place vacant to which they might now hopefully aspire.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-30.</span> - <span class="accented">The jealousy, among the disciples.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</span> The Lord's words in these verses are peculiar to St. Luke. The strife among the disciples which suggested the Lord's corrective sayings was evidently no mere dispute as to precedence in their places at the supper, but some question as to their respective positions in the coming kingdom of which their Master had said so much in the course of his later instructions. It is closely connected with the "feet-washing" related at length by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4-17</a>). This has been well described as a parable in action, exhibited to illustrate forcibly the novel and sublime truth which he was teaching them, the world-teachers of the future, that in self sacrifice consisted the secret of true greatness. In the kingdom of heaven this would be found to be conspicuously the case. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:21-38 How unbecoming is the worldly ambition of being the greatest, to the character of a follower of Jesus, who took upon him the form of a servant, and humbled himself to the death of the cross! In the way to eternal happiness, we must expect to be assaulted and sifted by Satan. If he cannot destroy, he will try to disgrace or distress us. Nothing more certainly forebodes a fall, in a professed follower of Christ, than self-confidence, with disregard to warnings, and contempt of danger. Unless we watch and pray always, we may be drawn in the course of the day into those sins which we were in the morning most resolved against. If believers were left to themselves, they would fall; but they are kept by the power of God, and the prayer of Christ. Our Lord gave notice of a very great change of circumstances now approaching. The disciples must not expect that their friends would be kind to them as they had been. Therefore, he that has a purse, let him take it, for he may need it. They must now expect that their enemies would be more fierce than they had been, and they would need weapons. At the time the apostles understood Christ to mean real weapons, but he spake only of the weapons of the spiritual warfare. The sword of the Spirit is the sword with which the disciples of Christ must furnish themselves.</body></html>
