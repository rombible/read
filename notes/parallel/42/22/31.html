The two-fold utterance of the name, as in the case of Martha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-41.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about many things:">Luke 10:41</a>), is significant of the emphasis of sadness.<p><span class= "bld">Satan hath desired to have you.</span>--Both this verb, and the "I have prayed," are in the Greek tense which indicates an act thought of as belonging entirely to the past. The Lord speaks as though He had taken part in some scene like that in the opening of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/2-1.htm" title="Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.">Job 2:1-6</a>), or that which had come in vision before the prophet Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-5</a>), and had prevailed by His intercession against the Tempter and Accuser.<p><span class= "bld">That he may sift you as wheat.</span>--The word and the figure are peculiar to St. Luke's record. The main idea is, however, the same as that of the winnowing fan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>; the word for "sift" implying a like process working on a smaller scale. The word for "you" is plural. The fiery trial by which the wheat was to be separated from the chaff was to embrace the whole company of the disciples as a body. There is a latent encouragement in the very word chosen. They were "to be sifted as <span class= "ital">wheat."</span> The good grain was there. They were not altogether as the chaff.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-38.</span> - The <span class="accented">Lord foretells Simon Peter's fall. He tells She disciples of the hard times coming on them.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have</span> <span class="cmt_word">you, that he may sift you as wheat</span>. The majority of the more ancient authorities omit the words, "and the Lord said." These words were possibly inserted at an early date to obviate the abruptness of this sudden change in the subject-matter of the Lord's discourse. The more accurate translation would be, "Satan obtained you by asking that he," etc. Bengel comments with "<span class="accented">not</span> <span class="accented">content with Judas."</span> This saying of Jesus is a very mysterious one; it reveals to us something of what is going on in the unseen world. A similar request was made by the same bitter, powerful the in the case or Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>). Are we to understand that these are examples of what is constantly going on in that world so close to us, but from which no whisper ever reaches our mortal ears? Such grave thoughts lend especial intensity to those words in the prayer of prayers, where we ask "our Father which is in heaven" <span class="accented">to deliver us from evil</span>, or <span class="accented">the evil one</span>, as so many of our best scholars prefer to translate <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Satan asks that he may test and try the apostles. Judas he had already tempted, and he had won him. Possibly this signal victory emboldened him to proffer this request. We may imagine the evil one arguing thus before the Eternal: "These chosen ones who are appointed to work in the future so tremendous a work in thy Name, are utterly unworthy. Let me just try to lure them away with my lures. Lo, they will surely fall. See, <span class="accented">one</span> has already." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:21-38 How unbecoming is the worldly ambition of being the greatest, to the character of a follower of Jesus, who took upon him the form of a servant, and humbled himself to the death of the cross! In the way to eternal happiness, we must expect to be assaulted and sifted by Satan. If he cannot destroy, he will try to disgrace or distress us. Nothing more certainly forebodes a fall, in a professed follower of Christ, than self-confidence, with disregard to warnings, and contempt of danger. Unless we watch and pray always, we may be drawn in the course of the day into those sins which we were in the morning most resolved against. If believers were left to themselves, they would fall; but they are kept by the power of God, and the prayer of Christ. Our Lord gave notice of a very great change of circumstances now approaching. The disciples must not expect that their friends would be kind to them as they had been. Therefore, he that has a purse, let him take it, for he may need it. They must now expect that their enemies would be more fierce than they had been, and they would need weapons. At the time the apostles understood Christ to mean real weapons, but he spake only of the weapons of the spiritual warfare. The sword of the Spirit is the sword with which the disciples of Christ must furnish themselves.</body></html>
