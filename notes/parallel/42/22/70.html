The answer is complete in itself; but it implies, as in the less ambiguous forms in St. Matthew and St. Mark, the confession that He actually was what they had asked Him. The "I am" has something of the same significance as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-24.htm" title="Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.">John 7:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a> (where see Notes).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 70.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said they all, Art thou then the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Son of God?</span> Now bringing forward the loftier title formerly suppressed (in ver. 67).

He owns himself to be the Son of God, though he knew he should suffer for it. Upon this they ground his condemnation. Their eyes being blinded, they rush on.
