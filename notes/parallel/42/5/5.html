It implies a less distinct recognition of our Lord's character as a teacher or Rabbi, and was more the language of general respect, such as workmen might use of their master. Here, however, St. Peter's language implies the previous discipleship which we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-35.htm" title="Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;">John 1:35-43</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Master</span>.

Time spent on week days in public exercises of religion, need be but little hinderance in time, and may be great furtherance to us in temper of mind, as to our worldly business. With what cheerfulness may we go about the duties of our calling, when we have been with God, and thus have our worldly employments sanctified to us by the word and prayer! Though they had taken nothing, yet Christ told them to let down their nets again. We must not abruptly quit our callings because we have not the success in them we desire. We are likely to speed well, when we follow the guidance of Christ's word. The draught of fishes was by a miracle. We must all, like Peter, own ourselves to be sinful men, therefore Jesus Christ might justly depart from us. But we must beseech him that he would not depart; for woe unto us if the Saviour depart from sinners! Rather let us entreat him to come and dwell in our hearts by faith, that he may transform and cleanse them. These fishermen forsook all, and followed Jesus, when their calling prospered. When riches increase, and we are tempted to set our hearts upon them, then to quit them for Christ is thankworthy.</body></html>
