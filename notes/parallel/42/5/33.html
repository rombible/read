It is only from St. Mark that we learn that they included the two classes to whom the question referred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-39.</span> <span class="accented">- The teaching of the Lord concerning fasting.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</span> We learn from the parallel passage in St. Mark that "they" who asked the Lord this question were the disciples of John the Baptist and the Pharisees, who united on this occasion. These disciples of John do not seem at first to have regarded Jesus with altogether friendly feelings. Such a jealousy was only too natural, and the rigid, unbending truthfulness of the evangelists compelled them to tell the story of the way the early foundations of the truth were laid without concealment of error or mistake. The Baptist himself practised the sternest asceticism, and required doubtless of his nearest followers that they should imitate his example. The Lord's way of life, his presence at feastings and merry-makings, his consorting with publicans, his choice of one of them as his disciple and friend, no doubt surprised and disturbed not a few of the followers of John; hence such a question as the one we are now considering, and such a querulous complaining as we hear of in the Fourth Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-25.htm">John 3:25, 26</a>). The practice of fasting among the Jews was as follows: In the Law of Moses only one appointed fast in the year was enjoined - that on the sole Day of Atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>). After the Exile the <span class="accented">one</span> fast was increased to <span class="accented">four.</span> But the prophets gave no sanction to this added ritual (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>). In the time of our Lord, rigid Jews used to fast twice a week (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>) - on Monday and Friday (the day on which, according to tradition, Moses went up Mount Sinai). It is evident that our Lord himself never observed or even approved of these fasts of the Pharisee sect. In the well-known and often-quoted passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-21.htm">Matthew 17:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-29.htm">Mark 9:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-30.htm">Acts 10:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a> - in many of the older authorities, <span class="accented">the word</span> 'fasting' <span class="accented">does not occur at all.</span> In the Revised Version in each of these instances "fasting" does not appear in the new text. While, then, we must unhesitatingly conclude that fasting is no rite commanded by the Blessed One, still the Church has practised it with signal advantage and profit on certain solemn occasions; but it must ever proceed from the impulse of the sorrow-stricken heart, it must be no penance or duty imposed by authority, least of all must it be regarded as pleasing in the eye of the Almighty, or in any sense a substitute for the practice of the higher virtues really loved of God - justice, mercy, and truth. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:27-39 It was a wonder of Christ's grace, that he would call a publican to be his disciple and follower. It was a wonder of his grace, that the call was made so effectual. It was a wonder of his grace, that he came to call sinners to repentance, and to assure them of pardon. It was a wonder of his grace, that he so patiently bore the contradiction of sinners against himself and his disciples. It was a wonder of his grace, that he fixed the services of his disciples according to their strength and standing. The Lord trains up his people gradually for the trials allotted them; we should copy his example in dealing with the weak in faith, or the tempted believer.</body></html>
