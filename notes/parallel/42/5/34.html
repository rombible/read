But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</span> On this reply of the Lord Jesus Godet very beautifully writes. "In the midst of this feast of publicans, the heart of Jesus is overflowing with joy; it is one of the hours when his earthly life seems to his feeling like a marriage-day. But suddenly his countenance becomes overcast: the shadow of a painful vision passes across his brow: 'The days will come,'... said he, in a solemn tone. At the close of this nuptial week, the Bridegroom himself will be suddenly smitten and cut off; then will come the time of fasting for those who to-day are rejoicing; there will be no necessity to enjoin it. In this striking and poetic answer Jesus evidently announces his violent death." The imagery of the bridegroom is drawn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19, 20</a>, and perhaps also from the more mystical Scripture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>. and the Song of Songs. Jesus here clearly regards himself as the Christ, as identical with the long looked-for Divine Deliverer; but at this comparatively early stage of his public career he was fully conscious that in his Person, with the triumphant would be joined the suffering Messiah. The word rendered "shall be taken away from (them)," <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>, only occurs here in the New Testament; it points evidently to a death of violence. While the intimation given to Nicodemus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>) was the first <span class="accented">private</span>, so this seems to have been the first <span class="accented">public</span> announcement of the last scene of the earth-life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:27-39 It was a wonder of Christ's grace, that he would call a publican to be his disciple and follower. It was a wonder of his grace, that the call was made so effectual. It was a wonder of his grace, that he came to call sinners to repentance, and to assure them of pardon. It was a wonder of his grace, that he so patiently bore the contradiction of sinners against himself and his disciples. It was a wonder of his grace, that he fixed the services of his disciples according to their strength and standing. The Lord trains up his people gradually for the trials allotted them; we should copy his example in dealing with the weak in faith, or the tempted believer.</body></html>
