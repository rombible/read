Jerusalem was the residence of all the nobles from the first (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-16.htm">Nehemiah 2:16</a>); no increase could be made in this element of the population. Nehemiah had to look lower, and to obtain his new settlers from the ranks of the "people." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The people ... cast lots.</span> No doubt under direction. The Jews had frequent recourse to the lot for the determining of doubtful matters, believing, as they did, that "the whole disposing thereof was of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). Divine sanction had been given, in the course of the Jewish history, to the use of the lot for the selection of persons (Joshua 7:16-18 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19-21</a>), for the distribution of lands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-25.htm">Numbers 26:25, 26</a>), and for the determination of the order in which different bodies should execute an office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a>). In the democratic states of Greece it was used widely to determine between candidates for an office. One in ten. Ewald supposes that this was to be the proportion between the population of Jerusalem and the whole population of the country, and ascribes the fixing of the proportion to Zerubbabel ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 159). But there is no statement to this effect in either Ezra or Nehemiah, and the brief narrative of this verse seems to imply the addition of a tenth part of the country population to the previous population of Jerusalem, rather than the establishment of any definite proportion between the two. Nine parts. Literally, "nine <span class="accented">hands</span>," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-34.htm">Genesis 43:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-24.htm">Genesis 47:24</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-36 The distribution of the people. - In all ages, men have preferred their own ease and advantage to the public good. Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.</body></html>
