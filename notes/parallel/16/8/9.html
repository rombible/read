Nehemiah's modesty had made him content to describe himself by the general and comparatively weak term <span class="accented">pechah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Said unto the people... Mourn not</span>. A combined remonstrance is made against the open grief of the people by the civil and ecclesiastical rulers, and by the order of Levites. Mourning was unsuitable for a day of high festivity, the opening day of the civil year and of the sabbatical month, itself a sabbath or day of rest, and one to be kept by blowing of trumpets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1-6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:9-12 It was a good sign that their hearts were tender, when they heard the words of the law. The people were to send portions to those for whom nothing was prepared. It is the duty of a religious feast, as well as of a religious fast, to draw out the soul to the hungry; God's bounty should make us bountiful. We must not only give to those that offer themselves, but send to those out of sight. Their strength consisted in joy in the Lord. The better we understand God's word, the more comfort we find in it; the darkness of trouble arises from the darkness of ignorance.</body></html>
