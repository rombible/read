Ezra began by an ascription of praise to Jehovah, as the Levites, probably under his direction, begin in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-5.htm">Nehemiah 9:5</a>, and as David began his last address to the congregation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-10.htm">1 Chronicles 29:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The great God</span>. The epithet belongs to the writer rather than to Ezra himself, who in his own book never uses it. It recurs in this section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Nehemiah 9:32</a>), and is also employed by Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Amen, Amen</span>.

Masters of families should bring their families with them to the public worship of God. Women and children have souls to save, and are therefore to acquaint themselves with the word of God, and to attend on the means of grace. Little ones, as they come to reason, must be trained up in religion. Ministers when they go to the pulpit, should take their Bibles with them; Ezra did so. Thence they must fetch their knowledge; according to that rule they must speak, and must show that they do so. Reading the Scriptures in religious assemblies is an ordinance of God, whereby he is honoured, and his church edified. Those who hear the word, should understand it, else it is to them but an empty sound of words. It is therefore required of teachers that they explain the word, and give the sense of it. Reading is good, and preaching is good, but expounding makes reading the better understood, and preaching the more convincing. It has pleased God in almost every age of the church to raise up, not only those who have preached the gospel, but also those who have given their views of Divine truth in writing; and though many who have attempted to explain Scripture, have darkened counsel by words without knowledge, yet the labours of others are of excellent use. All that we hear must, however, be brought to the test of Scripture. They heard readily, and minded every word. The word of God demands attention. If through carelessness we let much slip in hearing, there is danger that through forgetfulness we shall let all slip after hearing.</body></html>
