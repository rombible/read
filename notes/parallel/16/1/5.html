The opening of Nehemiah's prayer follows so closely the thoughts and words of Daniel's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4</a>), that it is almost impossible to suppose that one of the two writers had not the words of the other before him. As there are no sufficient grounds for questioning the generally received date of Daniel's prophecy ( <span class="date">B.C. 536</span>), we must suppose Nehemiah familiar with his writings, and an admirer of their tone and spirit. In this verse he differs from Daniel only in substituting "Jehovah" for "Lord" (<span class="accented">Adonai</span>), and introducing his own favourite phrase "God of heaven." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-44 The best reformers can but do their endeavour; when the Redeemer himself shall come to Zion, he shall effectually turn away ungodliness from Jacob. And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.</body></html>
