As to the former the terms used have a deep pathos. Those who had returned to their country--now only <span class= "ital">the province</span>--are, in the question, <span class= "ital">the Jews</span> <span class= "ital">that had escaped;</span> in the answer they are <span class= "ital">the Remnant that are left:</span> both being <span class= "ital">from the captivity.</span><p><span class= "bld">In great affliction and reproach.</span>--In distress because of the contempt of the people around. All these expressions are familiar in the prophets; but they are united here in a peculiar and affecting combination. As to the city, the report is that the walls were still "broken down": lying prostrate, with partial exceptions, as Nebuchadnezzar left them a hundred and forty-two years before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm" title="And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.">2Kings 25:10</a>), and, moreover, what had not been recorded, "the gates thereof burned with fire." Though the Temple had been rebuilt, there is no valid reason for supposing that. the walls of the city had been in part restored and again demolished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down</span>. It has been supposed, either that the demolition of the wall here referred to was quite recent, having occurred during the space of twelve years which intervenes between the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, or else that it belonged to a time of depression which followed shortly after the completion of the temple by Zerubbabel (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. pp. 120, 121, and 148, note 3, E. Tr.); but there is really no reason to believe that the demolition effected under the orders of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>) had ever hitherto been repaired, or the restoration of the wall even attempted. The Samaritan accusation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-12.htm">Ezra 4:12</a> falls short of a statement that the wall was restored, and, if it asserted the fact, would be insufficient authority for it. The supposition of Ewald, that "as soon as the city was rebuilt, the attempt <span class="accented">would be made</span> to fortify it" (p. 121, note 3), ignores the jealousy of the Persians and their power to step in and prevent a subject town from fortifying itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-44 The best reformers can but do their endeavour; when the Redeemer himself shall come to Zion, he shall effectually turn away ungodliness from Jacob. And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.</body></html>
