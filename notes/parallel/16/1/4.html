The prayer is a perfect example of the private and individual devotion with which the later Hebrew Scriptures abound. It begins with formal and appropriate invocation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/1-5.htm" title="And said, I beseech you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:">Nehemiah 1:5-8</a>), flows into earnest confession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/1-6.htm" title="Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you now, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you: both I and my father's house have sinned.">Nehemiah 1:6-7</a>), pleads the covenant promises (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/1-8.htm" title="Remember, I beseech you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, If you transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:">Nehemiah 1:8-10</a>), and supplicates a present answer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm" title="O LORD, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.">Nehemiah 1:11</a>). The extant Scriptures, freely used, are the foundation of all.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Fasted.</span>--Like Daniel, Esther, and Ezra, Nehemiah fasted: fasting appears in later Judaism a prominent part of individual devotion, as it is in the New Testament.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Both I and my father's house have sinned.</span>--The supplication was for the nation; and in such cases of personal intercession the individual assumes the sin of all the past.<p>(8) The spirit of many threatenings and promises is summed up, as in the prayer of Nehemiah 9.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">This day . . . this man.</span>--During his "certain days" of mourning Nehemiah had fixed upon his plan, suggested by his God. "This day" is "this occasion": the appeal itself was deferred for some months. The king becomes "this man" in the presence of the "God of heaven."<p><span class= "bld">For I was the king's cupbearer.</span>--One of his cupbearers, therefore in high authority, having confidential access to him.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I heard these things, I sat down and wept</span>. The revelation of the actual condition of Jerusalem came upon Nehemiah with a shock. He had perhaps not thought much upon the subject before; he had had no means of exact information; he had supposed the city flourishing under the superintendence of Ezra, whose piety and patriotism were no doubt known to him. It was a bitter grief to him to find that his people were still "a reproach to their neighbours," laughed to scorn by those whose walls had never been destroyed, or who had been allowed to rebuild them. And he may have felt that his city, under the circumstances of the time, was in real danger. As Dean Stanley observes - "In those days rather one may say m those countries of disorder, a city without locked gates and lofty walls was no city at all" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' Third Series, p. 124). A few years previously Egypt had been in revolt; she might revolt again, and carry her arms into Syria. Arab tribes from the desert might extend their raids into Judaea, and be tempted by the known value of the temple treasures to swoop upon the unwalled town. Such thoughts occurring to an excitable Oriental, produced not grief and anxiety merely, but a flood of tears (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-1.htm">Ezra 10:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And fasted</span>. Fasting had become a frequent practice among the Jews during the captivity. Solemn fasts had been introduced on the anniversaries of the taking of Jerusalem, the burning of the temple, and the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>). Fasting had also taken a prominent place in the devotions of individuals. Daniel fasted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>); Esther fasted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>); Ezra fasted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>); and now Nehemiah fasted. On the grounds of natural piety out of which the practice arises, see the comment on Ezra 10:6. <span class="cmt_word">The God of heaven</span>. See the comment on Ezra 1:2. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-44 The best reformers can but do their endeavour; when the Redeemer himself shall come to Zion, he shall effectually turn away ungodliness from Jacob. And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.</body></html>
