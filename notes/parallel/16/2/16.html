On Nehemiah's arrival at Jerusalem he found no single individual exercising authority, but a number of persons, a sort of town-council, whom he calls <span class="accented">khorim</span> and <span class="accented">saganim.</span> It is not clear that he made his commission known to them at first, or indeed that he divulged it before the interview mentioned in vers. 17 and 18. <span class="cmt_word">The rest that did the work</span> This seems to be said by anticipation, and to mean those who subsequently built the wall. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:9-18 When Nehemiah had considered the matter, he told the Jews that God had put it into his heart to build the wall of Jerusalem. He does not undertake to do it without them. By stirring up ourselves and one another to that which is good, we strengthen ourselves and one another for it.
