It appears from Ctesias ('Exc. Pers.,' &sect; 44) that Artaxerxes Longimanus had but one legitimate wife - a certain Damaspia. Nothing more is known of her besides this mention, and the fact that she died on the same day as her husband. (The Septuagint rendering of <span class="accented">hashegal</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span> is wrong.) <span class="cmt_word">Sitting by him</span>. Not an unusual circumstance. Though, when the monarch entertained guests, the queen remained in her private apartments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-9.htm">Esther 1:9-12</a>), yet on other occasions she frequently took her meals with him ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 214). <span class="cmt_word">I set him a time</span>. Nehemiah probably mentioned some such time as a year, or two years - such a space as would suffice for the double journey, and the restoration of the fortifications. He stayed away, however, as he tells us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>), twelve years, obtaining no doubt from time to time an extension of his leave (Bertheau). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Our prayers must be seconded with serious endeavours, else we mock God. We are not limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of kings, but have liberty to go to him at all times; approaches to the throne of grace are never out of season. But the sense of God's displeasure and the afflictions of his people, are causes of sorrow to the children of God, under which no earthly delights can comfort. The king encouraged Nehemiah to tell his mind. This gave him boldness to speak; much more may the invitation Christ has given us to pray, and the promise that we shall speed, encourage us to come boldly to the throne of grace. Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven, as infinitely above even this mighty monarch. He lifted up his heart to that God who understands the language of the heart. Nor should we ever engage in any pursuit in which it would be wrong for us thus to seek and expect the Divine direction, assistance, and blessing. There was an immediate answer to his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never sought the God of Jacob in vain.</body></html>
