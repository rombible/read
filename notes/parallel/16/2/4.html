With gracious kindliness he facilitates its utterance. <span class="cmt_word">So I prayed to the God of heaven.</span> Nehemiah was emphatically a man of prayer. In every danger, in every difficulty, still more at any crisis, prayer rose to his lips (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-14.htm">Nehemiah 13:14</a>, etc.). Sometimes, as now, the prayer was offered silently and swiftly. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Our prayers must be seconded with serious endeavours, else we mock God. We are not limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of kings, but have liberty to go to him at all times; approaches to the throne of grace are never out of season. But the sense of God's displeasure and the afflictions of his people, are causes of sorrow to the children of God, under which no earthly delights can comfort. The king encouraged Nehemiah to tell his mind. This gave him boldness to speak; much more may the invitation Christ has given us to pray, and the promise that we shall speed, encourage us to come boldly to the throne of grace. Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven, as infinitely above even this mighty monarch. He lifted up his heart to that God who understands the language of the heart. Nor should we ever engage in any pursuit in which it would be wrong for us thus to seek and expect the Divine direction, assistance, and blessing. There was an immediate answer to his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never sought the God of Jacob in vain.</body></html>
