The closing words imply that, as in the days of Zerubbabel, the Samaritan enemies desired really to have their share in the undertaking. Nehemiah makes Zerubbabel's answer, but strengthens it; they had nothing in common with Jerusalem, not even a place in its memorials, save one of shame.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered I.</span> It is remarkable that Nehemiah takes no notice of the serious charge brought against him, does not say that he had the king's permission, but rather leaves the "<span class="accented">adversaries"</span> to suppose that he had not. Perhaps he thought that to reveal the truth would drive them to some desperate attempt, and therefore suppressed it<span class="cmt_word">. The God of heaven, he will prosper us</span>. Instead of a human, Nehemiah claims a Divine sanction for his proceedings. He and his brethren will build as <span class="accented">servants of the God of heaven.</span> Compare the answer made to Tatnai in Zerubbabel's time - "We are <span class="accented">the servants of the God of heaven</span> and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-11.htm">Ezra 5:11</a><span class="cmt_word">). Ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</span> As the claim of the Samaritans to interfere in the affairs of the Jews had been disallowed when they came with an offer of aid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2, 3</a>), so now, when their interference is hostile in character, it is still more fiercely and indignantly rejected. They are told that they have no part in Jerusalem, no right, not even so much as a place in the recollections of the inhabitants. Their interference is officious, impertinent - what have they to do with Nehemiah, or the Israelites, or Jerusalem? Let them be content to manage the affairs of their own idolatrous community, and not trouble the worshippers of the true God. Nehemiah avoids opposition by concealment as long as he can; but when opposition nevertheless appears, he meets it with defiance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:19,20 The enmity of the serpent's seed against the cause of Christ is confined to no age or nation. The application to ourselves is plain. The church of God asks for our help. Is it not desolate, and exposed to assaults? Does the consideration of its low estate cause you any grief? Let not business, pleasure, or the support of a party so engage attention, as that Zion and her welfare shall be nothing to you.</body></html>
