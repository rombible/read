See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-8</a>. Small as the cost of the shew-bread was, consisting, as it did, of no more than twelve cakes of fine flour weekly, it is yet placed first on account of its importance, being the bread of God's presence, the type of the sacramental bread of the new covenant. <span class="cmt_word">The continual meat offering</span> is that offering of flour mingled with fine olive oil which God had required to be offered twice a day, at morning and at evening, in conjunction with the two lambs, which constituted the <span class="cmt_word">continual burnt offering</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-5.htm">Numbers 28:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the sabbaths</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "for the offering of the sabbath days," which consisted of two lambs with appropriate meat and drink offerings, in addition to the offering of every day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the new moons</span>. Two bullocks, one ram, seven lambs, with appropriate meat and drink offerings (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 11-14). <span class="cmt_word">For the set feasts</span>. The passover, the feast of Pentecost, the feast of trumpets, and the feast of tabernacles. The offerings required at each are given with great exactness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>, and 29. <span class="cmt_word">The holy things</span>. "Wave-offerings" and "peace-offerings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10, 17, 19</a>) are probably intended. They were "holy to the Lord for the priest" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 20). The sin offerings are those commanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-15.htm">Numbers 28:15, 22, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-5.htm">Numbers 29:5, 11, 16, 19</a>, etc<span class="cmt_word">. And for all the work of the house</span>. The internal "work" of cleansing and keeping in proper order the apparatus of worship is probably intended, not external repairs. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:32-39 Having covenanted against the sins of which they had been guilty, they obliged themselves to observe the duties they had neglected. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well. Let not any people expect the blessing of God, unless they keep up public worship. It is likely to go well with our houses, when care is taken that the work of God's house goes on well. When every one helps, and every one gives, though but little, toward a good work, the whole will come to be a large sum. We must do what we can in works of piety and charity; and whatever state we are placed in, cheerfully perform our duty to God, which will be the surest way to ease and liberty. As the ordinances of God are the appointed means of support to our souls, the believer will not grudge the expense; yet most people leave their souls to starve.</body></html>
