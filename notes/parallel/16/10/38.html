A priest was present when the tithes were gathered in the Levitical cities, to secure their own "tithe of the tithe," which then the Levites carried to Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priest shall be with the Levites when the Levites take tithe</span>. Some representative (or representatives) of the priestly order was to be present whenever the Levites received their tithes, to take note of the quantity, and prevent the Levites from depriving the priests of their due share - <span class="cmt_word">the tithe of the tithe</span>. This tenth, being thus ascertained, was to be conveyed to Jerusalem at the expense of the Levites, and deposited in its appropriate store-chamber. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:32-39 Having covenanted against the sins of which they had been guilty, they obliged themselves to observe the duties they had neglected. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well. Let not any people expect the blessing of God, unless they keep up public worship. It is likely to go well with our houses, when care is taken that the work of God's house goes on well. When every one helps, and every one gives, though but little, toward a good work, the whole will come to be a large sum. We must do what we can in works of piety and charity; and whatever state we are placed in, cheerfully perform our duty to God, which will be the surest way to ease and liberty. As the ordinances of God are the appointed means of support to our souls, the believer will not grudge the expense; yet most people leave their souls to starve.</body></html>
