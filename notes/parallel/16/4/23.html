Actual brothers probably. That Nehemiah had brothers appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-2.htm">Nehemiah 1:2</a>; that one of them, Hanani, had accompanied him to Jerusalem is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-2.htm">Nehemiah 7:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">My servants</span>.

As governor, Nehemiah would maintain a body-guard, in addition to his band of slaves. <span class="cmt_word">Saving that every one put them off for washing</span>. So the Vulgate: "Unnsquisque tantum nudabatur ad baptismum;" but it is at least doubtful whether the Hebrew words can possibly have this meaning. The most natural and literal sense of them is that given by Maurer and Rambach - "Each man's weapon was his water;" the supposed connection of the clause with the preceding being, "No one took off his clothes," not even for the bath - no one bathed; "a man's only bath was his weapon." Some critics, however, defend the rendering of the A. V.; others take the words in the same way, but explain the term "water" differently, of a natural want (Ewald, Stanley); while many regard the text as unsound, and propose emendations. None, however, that has as yet been proposed is satisfactory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:16-23 We must watch always against spiritual enemies, and not expect that our warfare will be over till our work is ended. The word of God is the sword of the Spirit, which we ought to have always at hand, and never to have to seek for it, either in our labours, or in our conflicts, as Christians. Every true Christian is both a labourer and a soldier, working with one hand, and fighting with the other. Good work is likely to go on with success, when those who labour in it, make a business of it. And Satan fears to assault the watchful Christian; or, if attacked, the Lord fights for him. Thus must we wait to the close of life, never putting off our armour till our work and warfare are ended; then we shall be welcomed to the rest and joy of our Lord.</body></html>
