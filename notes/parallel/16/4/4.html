Compare Ezra's parenthetic burst of thanksgiving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27, 28</a>). That which in Ezra was a sudden impulse has become a settled habit with Nehemiah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-14.htm">Nehemiah 13:14, 22, 29, 31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Turn their reproach upon their own head</span>. The imprecations of Nehemiah are no pattern to Christians, any more than are those of the Psalmists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-22.htm">Psalm 69:22-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-12.htm">Psalm 79:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6-20</a>, etc.); but it cannot be denied that they are imprecations. Before men were taught to "love their enemies," and "bless those that cursed them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>), they gave vent to their natural feelings of anger and indignation by the utterance of maledictions. Nehemiah's spirit was hot and hasty; and as he records of himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-25.htm">Nehemiah 13:25</a>) that he "cursed" certain Jews who had taken foreign wives, so it is not to be wondered at that he uttered imprecations against his persistent enemies. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Many a good work has been looked upon with contempt by proud and haughty scorners. Those who disagree in almost every thing, will unite in persecution. Nehemiah did not answer these fools according to their folly, but looked up to God by prayer. God's people have often been a despised people, but he hears all the slights that are put upon them, and it is their comfort that he does so. Nehemiah had reason to think that the hearts of those sinners were desperately hardened, else he would not have prayed that their sins might never be blotted out. Good work goes on well, when people have a mind to it. The reproaches of enemies should quicken us to our duty, not drive us from it.</body></html>
