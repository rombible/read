Of these, two only are known to us, Zerubbabel and Ezra; but it is probable that there had been others. <span class="cmt_word">Were chargeable unto the people</span>. The words of the original are stronger, and should be rendered "had <span class="accented">oppressed</span> the people (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.), "had been heavy upon them. <span class="cmt_word">Had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels</span>. Rather, "had taken from them, <span class="accented">for</span> bread and wine, <span class="accented">above</span> forty shekels." (So Ewald and Bertheau.) Forty shekels <span class="accented">a day</span> from the whole people would seem to be intended - not forty shekels a year from each person, as some explain. <span class="cmt_word">Even their servants bare rule</span>. The oppression exercised by the domestics and other hangers-on of rulers is often worse than their own. This is especially the case in the East, where eunuchs and other domestics have been the most fearful tyrants. Haman under Xerxes, Sejanus under Tiberius, Narcissus under Nero, are examples. <span class="cmt_word">So did not I.</span> I neither exacted money, nor allowed my servants to bear rule. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the fear of God</span>. Because I felt that it would be wrong, either absolutely or under the circumstances. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:14-19 Those who truly fear God, will not dare to do any thing cruel or unjust. Let all who are in public places remember that they are so placed to do good, not to enrich themselves. Nehemiah mentions it to God in prayer, not as if he had merited any favour from God, but to show that he depended upon God only, to make up to him what he had lost and laid out for his honour. Nehemiah evidently spake and acted as one that knew himself to be a sinner. He did not mean to claim a reward as of debt, but in the manner that the Lord rewards a cup of cold water given to a disciple for his sake. The fear and love of God in the heart, and true love of the brethren, will lead to every good work. These are proper evidences of justifying faith; and our reconciled God will look upon persons of this character for good, according to all they have done for his people.</body></html>
