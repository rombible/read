Bakbukiah's position with respect to Mattaniah has been already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a>). "Unni" appears, in this place only, as a Levite of Zerubbabel's time. <span class="cmt_word">Were over against them in the watches</span>. <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "ministered in their courses, as the others did, and kept their stations over against them in their turns of attendance, which are called their 'watches' or wards" (Bp. Patrick). LIST OF THE HIGH PRIESTS FROM JESHUA TO JADDUA (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10, 11</a>). That this is the line of descent in the high priestly family of the time sufficiently appears both from the names themselves, and from the position assigned to those who bore them in vers. 22, 23, 26. Whether all of them actually exercised the high priest's office is left uncertain in Scripture, but satisfactorily established by Josephus. The six names cover a space of at least 205 years - from the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus, <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, to the submission of Jerusalem to Alexander the Great, <span class="date">B.C. 333</span>, which gives very long generations, but still such as are historically possible. Jeshua was certainly high priest from <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 516</span>. He may have been succeeded by his son, Joiakim, about <span class="date">B.C. 490</span>. Joiakim had certainly been succeeded by his son, Eliashib, before <span class="date">B.C. 444</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>); and Eliashib was probably succeeded by Joiada about <span class="date">B.C. 420</span>. Joiada's high priesthood may be assigned to the period between <span class="date">B.C. 420</span> and 380; Jonathan's to that between <span class="date">B.C. 380</span> and 350. Jaddua might then hold the dignity from <span class="date">B.C. 350</span> to 330, or later, and so be brought into contact with Alexander the Great. It is questioned whether in that case Nehemiah can have written the present passage, and certain that he cannot have done so unless he lived to be at least 131 years of age. As this is exceedingly improbable, it is best to suppose, either that the whole list was placed here by Malachi, or at any rate that that prophet added the clause, "and Jonathan begat Jaddua." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-26 It is a debt we owe to faithful ministers, to remember our guides, who have spoken to us the word of God. It is good to know what our godly predecessors were, that we may learn what we should be.</body></html>
