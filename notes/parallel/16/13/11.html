While the guilt of profaning the temple lay especially with the priestly class, that of withholding the tithes was mainly chargeable on the "rulers," or "nobles." These persons, as wealthy landowners, had of course a pecuniary interest in keeping back the tithe. When they felt the control of a strong hand they made the payments regularly enough (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-47.htm">Nehemiah 12:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-12.htm">Nehemiah 13:12</a>); but no sooner was this control removed by Nehemiah's departure than they relapsed into the covetous habits in which they had indulged before he was made governor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-37.htm">Nehemiah 10:37</a>). The Church in all ages has suffered wrong from the cupidity of wealthy men among its members. <span class="cmt_word">Why is the house of God forsaken?</span> Why, contrarily to the distinct pledge given at the time of the renewal of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-39.htm">Nehemiah 10:39</a>), have you suffered the house of God to become a solitude, driving the Levites away from it by depriving them of their legal sustenance? <span class="cmt_word">I gathered them together</span>. Nehemiah brought the Levites back to the temple from their country residences, and re-established them in their proper offices. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:10-14 If a sacred character will not keep men from setting an evil example, it must not shelter any one from deserved blame and punishment. The Levites had been wronged; their portions had not been given them. They were gone to get livelihoods for themselves and their families, for their profession would not maintain them. A maintenance not sufficient, makes a poor ministry. The work is neglected, because the workmen are. Nehemiah laid the fault upon the rulers. Both ministers and people, who forsake religion and the services of it, and magistrates, who do not what they can to keep them to it, will have much to answer for. He delayed not to bring the Levites to their places again, and that just payment should be made. Nehemiah on every occasion looked up to God, and committed himself and all his affairs to Him. It pleased him to think that he had been of use to revive and support religion in his country. He here refers to God, not in pride, but with a humble appeal concerning his honest intention in what he had done. He prays, Remember me; not, Reward me. Wipe not out my good deeds; not, Publish them, or record them. Yet he was rewarded, and his good deeds recorded. God does more than we are able to ask.</body></html>
