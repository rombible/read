Some understand by this that the offenders underwent the bastinado by sentence of a court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-2.htm">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>); others think Nehemiah had them struck informally by his attendants. This latter explanation 'is supported by the following clause, since "plucking out the hair" was never a legal punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Made them swear by God</span>. Literally, "swore them by God," <span class="accented">i.e</span>. dictated the words, and made them repeat the formula and accept the oath. Saying, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not give</span>. Literally, "If ye shall give,' etc. Nehemiah made them swear that they should intermarry with the heathen the curse of God should fall upon them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:23-31 If either parent be ungodly, corrupt nature will incline the children to take after that one; which is a strong reason why Christians should not be unequally yoked. In the education of children, great care should be taken about the government of their tongues; that they learn not the language of Ashdod, no impious or impure talk, no corrupt communication. Nehemiah showed the evil of these marriages. Some, more obstinate than the rest, he smote, that is, ordered them to be beaten by the officers according to the law, De 25:2,3. Here are Nehemiah's prayers on this occasion He prays, Remember them, O my God. Lord, convince and convert them; put them in mind of what they should be and do. The best services to the public have been forgotten by those for whom they were done, therefore Nehemiah refers himself to God, to recompense him. This may well be the summary of our petitions; we need no more to make us happy than this; Remember me, O my God, for good. We may humbly hope that the Lord will remember us and our services, although, after lives of unwearied activity and usefulness, we shall still see cause to abhor ourselves and repent in dust and ashes, and to cry out with Nehemiah, Spare me, O my God, according to the greatness of they mercy.</body></html>
