Eliashib had failed in his duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm" title="And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah:">Nehemiah 13:4</a>); and the appointment of treasurers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-44.htm" title="And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.">Nehemiah 12:44</a>) is now confirmed. One of the treasurers was a layman named Hanan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-22.htm" title="Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,">Nehemiah 10:22</a>); but they were all faithful men, and are mentioned in connection with the building of the wall. The majority being priests and Levites, they distributed "to their brethren." Zadok was probably the Zidkijah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-1.htm" title="Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,">Nehemiah 10:1</a>, and the secretary of Nehemiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I made treasurers</span>. It was perhaps now for the first time that special treasurers were provided to have the charge of the temple store-chambers, these having hitherto been under the superintendence of the high priest (ver. 4). The appointment mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a> is probably the same with this; and the entire duty of the treasurers is to be learnt by combining that passage with the present. They were to be both the collectors and the dispensers of the tithes. Of the four treasurers, one was a priest, one a Levite, one a layman of rank (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-22.htm">Nehemiah 10:22</a>), and one a professional scribe. This last, <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span>, is perhaps to be identified with the "Zidkijah" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-1.htm">Nehemiah 10:1</a>, who appears to have been Nehemiah's private secretary (see the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">Unto their brethren</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the priests and Levites, brethren of Shelemiah and Pedaiah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:10-14 If a sacred character will not keep men from setting an evil example, it must not shelter any one from deserved blame and punishment. The Levites had been wronged; their portions had not been given them. They were gone to get livelihoods for themselves and their families, for their profession would not maintain them. A maintenance not sufficient, makes a poor ministry. The work is neglected, because the workmen are. Nehemiah laid the fault upon the rulers. Both ministers and people, who forsake religion and the services of it, and magistrates, who do not what they can to keep them to it, will have much to answer for. He delayed not to bring the Levites to their places again, and that just payment should be made. Nehemiah on every occasion looked up to God, and committed himself and all his affairs to Him. It pleased him to think that he had been of use to revive and support religion in his country. He here refers to God, not in pride, but with a humble appeal concerning his honest intention in what he had done. He prays, Remember me; not, Reward me. Wipe not out my good deeds; not, Publish them, or record them. Yet he was rewarded, and his good deeds recorded. God does more than we are able to ask.</body></html>
