He (Eliashib) had prepared (or made) for him (Tobiah) a great chamber - probably by throwing into one several of the old store-chambers. <span class="cmt_word">The meat offerings</span>. The <span class="accented">minchah</span> consisted of fine flour seasoned with salt, and mixed with oil and frankincense. It was made into a sort of cake, but without leaven, and formed part of the daily morning and evening sacrifice, the Sabbath offerings, and most others. <span class="cmt_word">The frankincense</span>. Frankincense was a necessary ingredient in the incense which was offered twice a day on the "altar of incense" in the holy place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34</a>). As a rare foreign product, it had necessarily to be kept in store. <span class="cmt_word">The vessels</span>.

See the benefit of publicly reading the word of God; when it is duly attended to, it discovers to us sin and duty, good and evil, and shows wherein we have erred. We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it. When sin is cast out of the heart by repentance, let the blood of Christ be applied to it by faith, then let it be furnished with the graces of God's Spirit, for every good work.</body></html>
