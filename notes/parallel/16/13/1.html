The process here was that of shutting out heathens who were in the habit of mingling with the people in the services. In Nehemiah 9 it was, as we saw, the people's separation from the practices and spirit of the heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On that day</span>.

It is uncertain whether this was a casual reading, like that of Ezra's, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-8</a>, or whether it was the prescribed reading (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11</a>) at the time of the feast of tabernacles. <span class="cmt_word">Therein was found written</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-5</a>. It seems to be implied that the nation at large had no knowledge of the law, except that which they derived from the occasional public reading of the Pentateuch, or portions of it. Copies of the law were extremely scarce; and even if an ordinary Jew possessed one, he would not have been able to understand it (comp. above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 Israel was a peculiar people, and not to mingle with the nations. See the benefit of publicly reading the word of God; when it is duly attended to, it discovers to us sin and duty, good and evil, and shows wherein we have erred. We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it. When sin is cast out of the heart by repentance, let the blood of Christ be applied to it by faith, then let it be furnished with the graces of God's Spirit, for every good work.</body></html>
