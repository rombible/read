Literally, "during all this"- while all this was being done. The reference seems to be solely to the affair of Eliashib and Tobiah. <span class="cmt_word">Artaxerxes, king of Babylon</span>. The title "king of Babylon," which was certainly borne by Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius Hystaspis, may have continued in use down to the time of Nehemiah, or even later. If he visited Artaxerxes at Babylon, the court happening to be there at the time, he would naturally think and speak of him as "king of Babylon." <span class="cmt_word">After</span> <span class="cmt_word">certain days</span>.

Gesenius and Professor Lee render, "I <span class="accented">asked</span> leave of the king; Houbigant, Rambach, and others, "I was asked for from the king," <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "the Jews asked to have me sent back to govern them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 Israel was a peculiar people, and not to mingle with the nations. See the benefit of publicly reading the word of God; when it is duly attended to, it discovers to us sin and duty, good and evil, and shows wherein we have erred. We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it. When sin is cast out of the heart by repentance, let the blood of Christ be applied to it by faith, then let it be furnished with the graces of God's Spirit, for every good work.</body></html>
