It is questioned whether the high priest of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a> is meant, and noted that the expression used - "the priest"- does not always designate "the high priest" (see ver. 13); but the important charge said to have been assigned to him, the alliance with so great a man as Tobiah, and the important step taken, the assignment to a heathen of a residence within the temple precincts, imply a man of high authority, and suit better with the high priest than with any one of lower rank. Moreover, the fact that Eliashib's leanings were towards the enemies of Nehemiah accounts for his disappearance from the history from <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Having the oversight</span>.

See the benefit of publicly reading the word of God; when it is duly attended to, it discovers to us sin and duty, good and evil, and shows wherein we have erred. We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it. When sin is cast out of the heart by repentance, let the blood of Christ be applied to it by faith, then let it be furnished with the graces of God's Spirit, for every good work.</body></html>
