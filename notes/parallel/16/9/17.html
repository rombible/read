Several MSS. have <span class="accented">b'Mitzraim</span> for <span class="accented">b'Miryam</span>, which would give the sense "appointed a captain to return to their bondage in Egypt." So the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">Appointed a captain</span>. The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a>, where we are told that the Israelites "said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt." The Levites speak as if the appointment had been made, perhaps regarding the intention as morally equivalent to the act. <span class="cmt_word">A God ready to pardon</span>. Literally, "a God of pardons." The word used is a rare one, occurring only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-9.htm">Daniel 9:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>, besides the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness</span>. This is quoted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, which is perhaps a conscious reproduction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-38 The summary of their prayers we have here upon record. Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.</body></html>
