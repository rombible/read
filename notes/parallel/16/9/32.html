Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, with the comment. <span class="cmt_word">Who keepest covenant and mercy</span>. This phrase, which occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, has apparently been derived from the Psalmist's words - "My <span class="accented">mercy</span> will I <span class="accented">keep</span> for him for evermore, and my <span class="accented">covenant</span> shall stand fast with him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the trouble</span>. Literally, "the weariness;" but the word is clearly used here for "suffering" generally. <span class="cmt_word">Since the time of the kings of Assyria</span>. The kings of Assyria, in the strictest sense of the word, had been God's original instrument for punishing his rebellious people. A king not mentioned in Holy Scripture tells us that he defeated Ahab, and forced Jehu to pay him tribute. Another (Pul) took tribute from Menahem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19, 20</a>). A third (Tiglath. Pfieser) carried two tribes and a half into captivity (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>). A fourth (Shalmaneser) laid siege to Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>), and a fifth (Sargon) took it. A sixth (Sennacherib) took all the fenced cities of Judah from Hezekiah, and forced him to buy the safety of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-16</a>). A seventh (Esar-haddon) had Manasseh brought as a prisoner to Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). Hence Isaiah calls the Assyrian monarch "the rod of God's anger" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-38 The summary of their prayers we have here upon record. Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.</body></html>
