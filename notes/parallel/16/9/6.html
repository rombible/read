Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a> and Isaiah 27:16. In the latter passage the phrase used is almost identical. <span class="cmt_word">The heaven of heavens</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-4.htm">Psalm 148:4</a>. The expression has been explained as - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The very highest heaven; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The heavens in all their infinity, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The latter sense best suits the various passages where the phrase occurs. <span class="cmt_word">With all their host</span>.

Still, it must be remembered that, according to H.S. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-3.htm">Psalm 148:3</a>), even the stars "praise" God. <span class="cmt_word">Thou preservest them all.</span> The preservation of all created things by him who called them into being is scarcely taught in the Old Testament elsewhere than in this passage. The Psalmist says in one place, "Thou preservest man and beast" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>); but this acknowledgment falls very far short of the universality of the present passage. Man naturally, but foolishly, fancies that things once created are able to preserve themselves. Exact thought sees, that if all things have been produced <span class="accented">from nothing</span>, it requires precisely the same power to sustain as originally to produce them. Hence "<span class="accented">preservation"</span> has been called "a continual creation." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:4-38 The summary of their prayers we have here upon record. Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.</body></html>
