This is additional to the information contained in Ezra, who does not separate Zerubbabel's offering from that of the other heads of families (Nehemiah 2:69). The account of the oblations is altogether more exact in Nehemiah than in the earlier historian. For the value of the contributions made, see the comment on Ezra (1.s.c.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:5-73 Nehemiah knew that the safety of a city, under God, depends more upon the inhabitants than upon its walls. Every good gift and every good work are from above. God gives knowledge, he gives grace; all is of him, and therefore all must be to him. What is done by human prudence, must be ascribed to the direction of Divine Providence. But woe to those who turn back from the Lord, loving this present world! and happy those who dedicate themselves, and their substance, to his service and glory!</body></html>
