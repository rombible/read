Through it the victims passed for sacrifice, first being washed in the neighbouring pool of Bethesda. This being built, "they sanctified it," as an earnest of the subsequent consecration of the entire wall. Their work and the sanctification of it extended to two towns near each other at the north-east corner.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Eliashib the high priest rose up</span>. It is satisfactory to find Eliashib the high priest taking the part which befitted him on this occasion. Subsequently we find him "allied by marriage to Tobiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>), and guilty of a profanation of the temple (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 5). By the line of high priests given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10, 11</a>, it appears that Eliashib was the son of Joiakim, and the grandson of the Jeshua who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With his brethren</span>. The priests generally. Compare ver. 28, which shows that the priests undertook a portion of the eastern wall, besides the work here mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Builded the sheep gate</span>. The "sheep gate" appears to have been a gate in the eastern wall, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> of St. John (John %;2), which was close to the pool of Bethesda. By this gate were brought in the sheep needed for sacrifice, which were then washed in the adjoining pool, and conveyed from it into the temple area, whereon the pool abuts. The priests dwelt principally in this portion of the city. <span class="cmt_word">They sanctified it</span>. This appears to have been a dedication quite distinct from that which is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>. The priests, having completed the rebuilding of the sheep gate, and of the wall extending from it northwards as far as the tower of Hananeel, anticipated the general dedication by a special one, which "sanctified," or consecrated, their own portion of the wall Thus a sacred character was impressed on the work at the earliest possible moment, and it was placed under the protection of the Almighty. <span class="cmt_word">The tower of Meah</span> (or rather Hammeah, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "the Hundred") and <span class="cmt_word">the tower of Hananeel</span> appear to have been situated almost at the same point of the wall. Perhaps they were opposite each other, like the towers in the walls of Babylon (Herod., 1:179). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-32 The rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. - The work was divided, so that every one might know what he had to do, and mind it, with a desire to excel; yet without contention, or separate interests. No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.</body></html>
