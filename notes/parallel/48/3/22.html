Here, as in ver. 8, we feel ourselves at liberty not to limit the apostle's reference to one passage, as that cited in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a> or ver. 23 of this chapter, but to understand him as including in his scope the teaching of Holy Scripture in both these and other places; having probably in view some such general summary of the contents of God's Word as bearing upon the subject, as he has alleged in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3.htm">Romans 3</a>. It is highly probable that some such summary, very possibly this identical one with variations, he was wont frequently to employ, as he certainly had constant occasion to do, in reasoning with his fellow-Jews and others, in synagogues and elsewhere. As in ver. 8, so here, the term "Scripture" is so applied as to invest Scripture with a sort of personal agency, which in stricter propriety would be predicated of its Divine Author. We have, in fact, presented to us the action of God himself in his ordering of that older economy, and not merely the statement of Scripture describing the condition of things under it. "Shut it all up under sin;" leaving no loop-hole of escape. The sense of the verb is illustrated by its use in the Septuagint (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>), "Jericho was (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) straitly shut up." God, in the appointments and revelations of the Law, found and pointedly left his people, so to speak, under the operation and overmastering of sin, providing for them therein, and as yet, no such outlet from either its condemnation or its power ("the law of sin," Romans) as he purposed in after times to open for them. The description stands in marked contrast with the blessed liberty predicated in the next chapter of the children of "Jerusalem which is above." This condition of things under the old economy is represented as being only a <span class="accented">provisional</span> ordering of the Divine Disposer, made with a view to a perfect manifestation of delivering goodness to come by-and-by. "Shut up... that," etc. We have a remarkable parallel to this twofold significance of "shut up," both as present and as prospective, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>," God hath shut up all men unto disobedience (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), that he might have mercy upon all;" where likewise the providential ordering of God is spoken of, and not the description of Scripture only. There we read <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, here <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, with an evident propriety in the choice of gender; for there St. Paul is thinking of Jews and of Gentiles as severally coming under the operation of the Divine "shutting up;" here he is not thinking of varied personalities, but rather of the entire circumstances of men under the legal economy. <span class="cmt_word">That the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given</span> <span class="cmt_word">to them that believe</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>). The term "promise," as connected with the verb "might be given," denotes beyond doubt the thing promised, as in ver. 14, "the promise of the Spirit:" this is "the promise" meant here. Now, if we were to join the words, "by faith of Jesus Christ," with the noun "promise," we should have to understand the two together as meaning," the promise which was made to Abraham because of his faith in Jesus Christ;" and this would be attended with a twofold inconvenience: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the term would have to be taken in two senses in the same sentence; it would first mean here, "the word of promise spoken to Abraham," and then, when immediately after taken with the verb "might be given," it would change its sense into that of "the thing promised;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> this method of construing the sentence would import a new thought, one which did not, so far as we know - it may have done so, perhaps, but there is no proof of it - belong to St. Paul's views of the subject; namely, that "Jesus Christ" - not merely "Christ," but "Jesus Christ" the historical Son of David - was believed in by Abraham. It appears safer, therefore, to connect the words, "by faith of Jesus Christ," with the verb; thus: "that the promise might by faith, as a consequence of faith, of Jesus Christ be given to them that believe." The apostle redoubles the mention of "faith" as the qualification for receiving the gift. "Faith! Faith! with none of your wretched works of ceremonialism! Compare for this iteration of faith, vers. 2-7. He adds, "of Jesus Christ," to "by faith," to mark that the bestowment of the blessing was delayed till Christ should have actually come, to whose line amongst Abraham's posterity the promise had been made. The apostle intimates that the ulterior purpose which God had in view in then "shutting it all up under sin," the purpose which is described in this last sentence, was likewise signified by "Scripture," as well as the condition of comparative helplessness and condemnation, under which those subject to the Law were detained. The participle <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> is either a class substantive (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>), "<span class="accented">to</span> believers," or the present tense of the participle points to action contemporaneous with that expressed by the verb, "to them that should believe." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:19-22 If that promise was enough for salvation, wherefore then serveth the law? The Israelites, though chosen to be God's peculiar people, were sinners as well as others. The law was not intended to discover a way of justification, different from that made known by the promise, but to lead men to see their need of the promise, by showing the sinfulness of sin, and to point to Christ, through whom alone they could be pardoned and justified. The promise was given by God himself; the law was given by the ministry of angels, and the hand of a mediator, even Moses. Hence the law could not be designed to set aside the promise. A mediator, as the very term signifies, is a friend that comes between two parties, and is not to act merely with and for one of them. The great design of the law was, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to those that believe; that, being convinced of their guilt, and the insufficiency of the law to effect a righteousness for them, they might be persuaded to believe on Christ, and so obtain the benefit of the promise. And it is not possible that the holy, just, and good law of God, the standard of duty to all, should be contrary to the gospel of Christ. It tends every way to promote it.</body></html>
