The Greek word is that from which is derived the English "pedagogue." Originally it meant the slave who was placed in charge of a child, and whose duty it was to conduct it to school. The idea is that of moral rather than of intellectual discipline. The care of the "pedagogue" ceased where that of the school-master began, but it was he who had more especially to form the character of the child. Horace notes as a peculiar advantage of his own that his father himself had taken the place of pedagogue to him (<span class= "ital">Sat.</span> i. 6, 81, 82).<p><span class= "bld">To bring us unto Christ.</span>--The words "to bring us," it will be seen, are supplied. They may be retained, provided that the metaphor is not pressed to the extent of supposing that Christ represents the schoolmaster proper to whom the child is led by the pedagogue slave. The work of Christ as a <span class= "ital">Teacher</span> is not what the Apostle has in mind. It is rather a higher kind of guardianship, which is to succeed that of the Law, and to which the Law <span class= "ital">hands over</span> its pupil. Once brought within the guardianship of Christ, and so made a member of the Messianic kingdom, the Christian is <span class= "ital">justified by faith,</span> he receives an amnesty for his past sins, and is accounted righteous before God. (See Epistle to the Romans, <span class= "ital">Excursus E: On the Doctrine of Justification by Faith and Imputed Righteousness.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore the Law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">wherefore the Law hath been the keeper of our childhood to</span> keep us <span class="accented">unto Christ.</span> With St. Paul, <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, so that, frequently is used to introduce a sentence which is not dependent in construction on the preceding words, but is one which makes a fresh departure as if with the adverbial conjunction "<span class="accented">wherefore</span>," or "so then." Thus ver. 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-12.htm">2 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:18</a>, in which last passage it is even followed by an imperative, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> differs from <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> by describing, past action as ending in a result which still continues. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> frequently denotes "prove one's self, ... act as" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>). The Law hath done with us (says the apostle) the work of a child's caretaker (<span class="accented">paedagogus</span>), with an eye to Christ, to whom we have now been banded over. (For the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, see note on ver. 23.) <span class="accented">Paedagogus</span> has no equivalent in the English language; "pedagogue," "schoolmaster," "tutor," "guardian," are all inadequate, covering each one an area of thought more or less quite different. "Tutor," as the masculine of "governess," comes perhaps nearest; but a tutor to a gentleman's children is generally an educated man, and often of like rank in life with those he is with; whereas a <span class="accented">paedagogus</span> was usually a slave - an element of thought probably very near to the apostle's consciousness in his present use of the term. In illustration of this and other points bearing upon this subject, the reader will be interested by a passage cited by Bishop Lightfoot out of Plato's 'Lysis' (p. 208, C). Socrates is questioning a young friend. "' They let you have your own ruling of yourself: or do they <span class="accented">not</span> trust you with this, either?' 'Trust me with it, indeed!' he said. 'But as to this, who has the ruling of you?' 'This man here,' he said, 'a <span class="accented">tutor.</span> 'Being a slave, eh?' 'But what of that?' said he; 'yes; only, a slave of our own.' 'An awfully strange thing this,' I said, 'that you, freeman that you are, should be under the ruling of a slave. But further, what does this tutor of yours, as your ruler, do with you?' 'He takes me,' said he, 'to a teacher's house, of course.' 'Do they rule you too, the teachers?' ' Certainly, of course.' 'A mighty number it seems of masters and rulers does your father think proper to set over you.'" Teaching, except possibly of the very first rudiments, was not the <span class="accented">padagogus's</span> business, but only the general care and superintendence of his charge - taking him to and back from his teachers' houses or the schools of physical training, looking after him in his play hours, and the like. In applying to the Law the figure of a <span class="accented">paedagogus</span>, the features which the apostle had in view were probably these: the childhood or non-age of those under its tutelage; their withdrawal from free parental intercourse; their degraded condition probably as being under servile management; the exercise over dram of unsympathizing hardness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>, "Though ye have ten thousand <span class="accented">tutors</span> in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers"); coercive discipline; the rudimentary character of their instruction (this particular, however, is likewise of questionable application); the temporary and purely provisional nature of the condition under which they were placed; its termination in the full enjoyment of freedom and of participation in their father's inheritance. The clause, "unto Christ," can hardly mean "to bring us to Christ," tempting as this interpretation may seem, in view of the verbal constituent (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>)" bring" in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and of the fact that it was one part of the duty of the child's keeper to take him to his school. For there are the following objections to taking it so: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The child-keeper's relation to his charge did not end with his taking him to school, but continued on throughout his non-age; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the function of Christ is not viewed here as instruction; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> if this construction had been in the apostle's view, he would have written <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, as in the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> ("to the teacher's house") of the passage above cited from Plato. We must, therefore, understand the preposition as in the preceding verse, "with a view to." The next clause is the explanation. <span class="cmt_word">That we might be justified by faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">in order that by faith we might get justified.</span> This clause is the most important part of the sentence. Not from the Law was to come righteousness; the Law was no more than introductory or preparatory; righteousness (once more the apostle reminds the Galatians) was to come to us as a free gift through Christ, upon simply our faith, the Law having now nothing to do with us. Hence the emphatic position of the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. The apostle does not, in the present connection, make it his business to explain in what way the Law was preparatory, which he does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>; his purpose at present is to insist upon its purely provisional character. What we have here is a description of the relation of the Law to God's people viewed collectively; but we can hardly fail to be reminded, that this experience of the collective people of God very commonly finds its counterpart in respect to the ethical bearing of the Law in the experience of each individual believer. Only, we have still to bear in mind that the apostle is thinking of the Law just now more in its ceremonial aspect than its ethical. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:23-25 The law did not teach a living, saving knowledge; but, by its rites and ceremonies, especially by its sacrifices, it pointed to Christ, that they might be justified by faith. And thus it was, as the word properly signifies, a servant, to lead to Christ, as children are led to school by servants who have the care of them, that they might be more fully taught by Him the true way of justification and salvation, which is only by faith in Christ. And the vastly greater advantage of the gospel state is shown, under which we enjoy a clearer discovery of Divine grace and mercy than the Jews of old. Most men continue shut up as in a dark dungeon, in love with their sins, being blinded and lulled asleep by Satan, through wordly pleasures, interests, and pursuits. But the awakened sinner discovers his dreadful condition. Then he feels that the mercy and grace of God form his only hope. And the terrors of the law are often used by the convincing Spirit, to show the sinner his need of Christ, to bring him to rely on his sufferings and merits, that he may be justified by faith. Then the law, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, becomes his loved rule of duty, and his standard for daily self-examination. In this use of it he learns to depend more simply on the Saviour.</body></html>
