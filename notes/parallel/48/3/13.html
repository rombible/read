How? Christ has taken it upon Himself. The Crucifixion brought Him under the curse of the Law. At the same time, it abolished the dominion of the Law, and threw open the Messianic blessedness to Gentiles as well as Jews: in other words, to all who gave in their adhesion to the Messiah <span class= "ital">by faith.</span><p>(13) <span class= "bld">Christ hath redeemed us.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Christ redeemed us.</span> The opening of this verse without any connecting particle lends sharpness and emphasis to the contrast. The Law brought a curse. There it stopped short. That was all it could do. The first thing that Christianity does is to undo this result of the Law by deliverance from the curse.<p>This deliverance is represented under the form of a <span class= "ital">ransom.</span> Christ "bought off" the human race from the penalty of its sins, the price paid being His death. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm" title="You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.">1Corinthians 7:23</a>, "Ye are (were) bought with a price;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>, "The Lord that bought them;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>, "Thou wast slain and hast redeemed (bought) us to God by thy blood;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm" title="These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.

The word used in these passages, as well as in that before us, is the general word for "buying." But that the "buying" intended is that more definitely conveyed by the idea of "ransom" appears from the use of the special word for ransom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a> ( = <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>), "The Son of Man came to give His life a ransom for many;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>, "Who gave Himself a ransom for all."

The Apostle is writing to a Gentile (though Judaising) Church, and he does not wish to exclude any of his readers. Though the Gentiles do not come directly under "the curse of the Law," they came under God's condemnation. From this they were released, and the blessings of the theocracy hitherto annexed to the Law were thrown open to them by the death of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">From the curse of the law.</span>--From that curse which the Law pronounced upon all who failed to keep its precepts.<p><span class= "bld">Being made a curse.</span>--Being treated as if He were accursed.

The idea is somewhat strengthened by the use of the substantive for the adjective. The curse identifies itself with its object: seizes, as it were, upon the person of its victim.<p><span class= "bld">For us</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "on our behalf," "for our sakes," not "in our stead." It is impossible to escape the conclusion that St. Paul, like the rest of the Apostles, regarded the sufferings of Christ as undergone <span class= "ital">in our stead.</span> The idea is, indeed, distinctly expressed in this very passage; but it must be gathered from the context, not from the use of the preposition. The preposition which means "instead" is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">As it is</span> <span class= "bld">written.</span>--The way in which the curse of the Law fell upon Christ was through His death. The ignominious death by which He died was one to which the curse of God specially attached. The Law expressly declared that that criminal who died upon the cross or gibbet was an object of the divine wrath. Christ died as such a criminal, and so came under the curse.<p>It is to be observed, in considering the doctrinal bearings of this passage, that the curse which fell upon Christ was <span class= "ital">not</span> the same curse as that described above as the consequence of human guilt in failing to keep the requirements of the Law. It is not the accumulated penalty for the whole mass of human disobedience, but rather an incidental defilement, contracted by an in-voluntary breach of a particular ceremonial precept. The death of Christ involved a curse because the manner of it was by suspension from a cross. Nothing more than this is said. Christ, the sinless One, died for sinful men. If He had not died they must have died. And His death acted (in some inscrutable way) so as to propitiate the wrath of God. But it is not said that the actual load of human guilt was laid upon Him. It is not said that His death was the actual punishment of that guilt. The death of Christ removed the necessity for the punishment of men, but it could not be regarded as a punishment in relation to Christ Himself. In this respect it would seem as if the symbolism of the scapegoat (which is sometimes adduced in explanation of the present passage) was imperfectly applicable. In the case of the scapegoat, the high priest was to lay his hands upon his head, and to "confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat;" and the goat was to "bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/16-21.htm" title="And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:">Leviticus 16:21-22</a>). No such process as this really took place in the case of our Lord; nor is it applied to Him even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>, otherwise than in vague and general metaphor. The literal application derives no countenance from the present passage, but is rather contradicted by it. It expressly distinguishes between the curse which fell upon Christ and the curse which was due to the sins of men, though the incurrence of the one led to the abrogation of the other.<p><span class= "bld">Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</span>--From <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm" title="His body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that your land be not defiled, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>. The Hebrew and LXX. insert "of God"--"He that is hanged is cursed of God"--which St. Paul instinctively omits. The reference in the original is to the exposure of the body upon a stake or gibbet after death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">Christ bought us off from the curse of the Law.</span> The position of the word "Christ" in the Greek, heading the sentence, makes it emphatic - Christ; he alone; no means offered by the Law hath procured justification for the sinner. "Us;" not merely the Israelites after the flesh, who were visibly under the Law: but <span class="accented">either</span> all mankind, Gentiles as well as Israelites, being declared by the Law unclean and unholy, both ceremonially and morally, and thus under its curse (comp.

"Redeemed," or "bought us off." The same compound Greek verb occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5</a>, "That he might redeem [buy off] them who were under the Law;" obviously, buy off from being under it. Another Greek verb, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, ransom, is rendered "redeem" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; whence the compound verbal noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, redemption, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>, etc. The apostle may be supposed to have preferred to use <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> here, as pointing more definitely to the price which the Redeemer paid; for in <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, redeem, this notion of a price paid often lies so far in the background as to leave the verb to denote simply "deliver." The un-compounded verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, buy, is found with reference to Christ's death in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a> and 1 Cor 7:23, "Ye were bought with a price;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, "The Master that bought them;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, "Didst purchase unto God with thy blood." In the present passage it is not the blood of Christ, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>, that is regarded as the purchase money, - for the notion of expiation with blood of sacrifice is not even glanced at; but rather, as the next words show, his taking upon him the accursedness and pollution which by the Law attached to every one crucified. "From the curse of the Law;" its cursing affects us no more. God's people are, in Christ. no longer, as they were before, subject to his disapproval or abhorrence, in consequence of transgressing the positive, ceremonial enactments of the Law of Moses. In respect to that class of transgressions, its cursing expended itself, and perished, upon the crucified body of the Son of God. <span class="cmt_word">Being made a curse for us</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fc0;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">having become on our behalf a curse.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> makes it emphatic. The form of expression, "become a curse," instead of "become accursed," is chosen to mark the intense degree in which the Law's curse fastened upon the Lord Jesus. Compare the expression, "made him on our behalf sin," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>. Probably the form of expression was suggested to the apostle by that found in the Hebrew of the passage of Deuteronomy which he proceeds to cite (see next note but one). The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>, "for,... . on behalf of," may possibly mean "in place of," as (perhaps) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13</a>; but this idea would have been more distinctly expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>: and the strict notion of substitution is not necessary to the line of argument here pursued. <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">it is written</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>).

The Hebrew is <span class="accented">qillath elohim talui</span>, "a curse of God is he that is hanged." The words, "every one" and "on a tree," are additions made by the Septuagint; the latter expression, however, is found in the preceding clause, as also in the preceding verse; so that the sense is given rightly. The apostle departs from the Septuagintal rendering of the Hebrew phrase, "a curse of God," probably because he regarded the rendering as inaccurate; for the phrase, "curse of God," is probably a strongly intensive form of expression, like "wrestlings of God," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-8.htm">Genesis 30:8</a> ("great wrestlings," Authorized Version). See note on "exceeding great city" (Hebrew, "a city great unto God") in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>, in 'Speaker's Commentary.' According to this view, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in which the element <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is intensive, is a just interpretation; while it also makes the clause more striking as an antithesis to the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., in ver. 10. We are, per haps, justified in adding that it would not have exactly suited the apostle's purpose to admit the words," by God;" for, though the Law pronounced the crucified Jesus a "curse," God, in the apostle's feeling, did not in this case ratify the Law's malediction. To understand the bearing of the verse rightly it is necessary to be quite clear as to the sense in which Christ is here said to have become a curse. The context shows that he became a curse simply by hanging upon a tree. No spiritual trans action, such as that of our guilt being laid upon him, comes into view here at all. It was simply the suspension upon a cross that imparted to him, in the eye of the Law, this character of accursedness, of extreme abhorrent defilement. In other words, the accursedness was the extreme of ceremonial pollutedness - ceremonial, with no admixture of guilt or spiritual pollution. It has, indeed, been attempted by critics, Jewish as well as Christian, as Bishop Lightfoot has shown, to justify this aphorism of the Law, by the plea that one thus punished might inferentially be supposed to have merited this form of execution by some especial enormity of guilt. But, plainly, such previous guiltiness might <span class="accented">not</span> have been present; the man crucified, or impaled, or hung might have suffered upon a false accusation. But though he bad suffered unjustly, his being gibbeted would, notwithstanding his innocence, constitute him "a curse of God" all the same. Ceremonial pollutedness, as well as ceremonial purity, was altogether independent of moral considerations. And at present the line of thought which the apostle is following relates simply to questions of Levitical or ceremonial purity or defilement. Have Christian believers as such anything to do with these matters? This is the point at issue. The apostle proves that they have nothing to do with them, upon the ground that the crucifixion of Christ did away wholly with the ceremonial Law. It will only confuse the reader if he supposes that the apostle means here to embody the whole doctrine of Christ's sacrificial atonement; he is at present concerned with stating the relation which his passion bore to the Law. The passage before us illustrates the meaning of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>, "I <span class="accented">through the Law</span> died unto the Law:" he felt himself disconnected from the ceremonial Law, in consequence of that Law pronouncing Christ crucified "a curse of God." A question arises, how far the crucifixion of Christ, viewed in this particular aspect of its constituting him in the eye of the ceremonial Law an accursed thing, modified for those who believe on him the effect of the malediction which the Law pronounced upon such as violated its moral precepts. The following observations are offered for the reader's consideration. The Law given in the Pentateuch is uniformly spoken of in Scripture as forming one whole. Composed of precepts, some moral, some ceremonial, some partaking mixedly of both qualities, it constituted, however, one entire coherent system. If a part of it was destroyed, the whole Law as such itself perished. If so, then the cross of Christ, by annihilating its ceremonial enactments, shattered in pieces the whole legislation, so that the disciples of Christ are no longer <span class="accented">at all</span> under its dominion, or subjects jurisprudentially (so to speak) to its coercive punitive power. Yet its moral precepts, so far as they embodied the eternal principles of rectitude, would, so far, and because they do so, and not because they were part of the Law given through Moses, continue to express the will of God concerning us. Being, however, "letter" and not "spirit," they were always altogether inadequate expressions of that Divine will - a will which is spiritual, 'which is evermore changing its form and aspect towards each human soul, according to the ever-varying conditions of its spiritual position. The moral precepts of the Law are for us no more than types or figures, mere hints or suggestions of the spiritual duties which they refer to; they cannot be regarded as definitively regulative laws at all. Thus they appear to be treated by Christ and his apostles; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-8.htm">1 Corinthians 9:8-10</a>; and it is in this light that the Church of England regards them, in reciting the Decalogue in her Pre-Communion Office. And, analogously, the curse which the Law pronounces upon those who set any of its precepts at nought, whether moral or ceremonial, may be regarded as a mere type, revealing, or rather giving a slightest most imperfect glimpse of, the wrath with which the Divine justice burns against wilful transgressors of the eternal Law; a hint or suggestion, again, and not its direct denouncement. God's people, however, by being through faith united to the crucified and risen Christ, become through his cross dead to the whole Law of Hoses, both as regulative and as punitive, - freed from it absolutely; not, however, to be without Law unto God; only, the Law they are now under is a spiritual Law, one conformable to the nature of that dispensation of life and of the Spirit, to which through the Risen One they belong. With this view it agrees that the execration which the Law pronounced upon the Son of God as crucified, and by pronouncing which the Law itself perished, is to be regarded as a most significant and impressive symbol of the <span class="accented">spiritual</span> import of our Lord's death. It pronounces to the universe that, for those who by faith are one with Christ, the wrath of Divine justice against them as sinners is quenched - quenched in the infinite, Divine love and righteousness of Christ. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-14 The apostle proves the doctrine he had blamed the Galatians for rejecting; namely, that of justification by faith without the works of the law. This he does from the example of Abraham, whose faith fastened upon the word and promise of God, and upon his believing he was owned and accepted of God as a righteous man. The Scripture is said to foresee, because the Holy Spirit that indited the Scripture did foresee. Through faith in the promise of God he was blessed; and it is only in the same way that others obtain this privilege. Let us then study the object, nature, and effects of Abraham's faith; for who can in any other way escape the curse of the holy law? The curse is against all sinners, therefore against all men; for all have sinned, and are become guilty before God: and if, as transgressors of the law, we are under its curse, it must be vain to look for justification by it. Those only are just or righteous who are freed from death and wrath, and restored into a state of life in the favour of God; and it is only through faith that persons become righteous. Thus we see that justification by faith is no new doctrine, but was taught in the church of God, long before the times of the gospel. It is, in truth, the only way wherein any sinners ever were, or can be justified. Though deliverance is not to be expected from the law, there is a way open to escape the curse, and regain the favour of God, namely, through faith in Christ. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law; being made sin, or a sin-offering, for us, he was made a curse for us; not separated from God, but laid for a time under the Divine punishment. The heavy sufferings of the Son of God, more loudly warn sinners to flee from the wrath to come, than all the curses of the law; for how can God spare any man who remains under sin, seeing that he spared not his own Son, when our sins were charged upon him? Yet at the same time, Christ, as from the cross, freely invites sinners to take refuge in him.</body></html>
