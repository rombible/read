A covenant once ratified is binding. It cannot be treated as if it did not exist, neither can fresh clauses be added to it. Now the covenant and promise made to Abraham (by the terms in which it was made) could point to no one but the Messiah. That covenant remained unaffected by the Law, which was four hundred and thirty years subsequent to it in point of date. Law and promise are two totally different and mutually exclusive things. But the covenant with Abraham was given by promise. The Law, therefore, had nothing to do with it.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">I speak after the manner of men.</span>--The figure that I am going to use is one taken from the ordinary civil relations between man and man, and therefore, it is left to be inferred, supplies an <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> argument in things relating to God, for men may change and break the most solemn engagements; God is absolutely faithful and unchangeable. The phrase translated "I speak after the manner of men" is found in the same, or a very similar form, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)">Romans 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm" title="I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.">Romans 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-8.htm" title="Say I these things as a man? or said not the law the same also?">1Corinthians 9:8</a>, where see the Notes.<p><span class= "bld">Though it be but a man's covenant.</span>--This is well rendered in the Authorised version. A covenant, even though it is only between two men--though it is regulated by the provisions only of human law--does not admit of alteration or addition after it has once been signed and sealed; much more a covenant which depends on God.<p><span class= "bld">Covenant.</span>--The word thus translated is that which gave its name to the "Old and New Testaments," where a more correct rendering would be the "Old and New <span class= "ital">Covenants."</span> The word has both senses. It meant originally a "disposition" or "settlement," and hence came, on the one hand, to be confined to a "testamentary disposition," while, on the other hand, it was taken to mean a settlement arrived at by agreement between two parties. The first sense is that most commonly found in classical writers; the second is used almost entirely in the LXX. and New Testament. The one exception is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15-17</a>, where the idea of "covenant" glides into that of "testament," the argument rather turning upon the double meaning of the word.<p><span class= "bld">Addeth thereto.</span>--Adds new clauses or conditions. Such new clauses could only be added by a second covenant. The reason why the Apostle introduces this point is that the Law might be supposed to restrict the bearings of the promise. It might be thought to add certain new and limiting conditions, without compliance with which the blessings of the promise could not be obtained. This was the position of the Judaising party, against which St. Paul is arguing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren, I speak after the manner of men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>). "Brethren." The tone of indignant reproach with which the chapter opened has gradually subsided in the course of the apostle's argument; so that here he appeals to the Galatian Churchmen as "brethren; ' as if to bespeak their candid attention to the consideration he is about to allege. "I speak after the manner of men." I say it as stating a principle commonly recognized in human life, in respect to contracts between man and man (see note on the phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11</a>). In a similar manner, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16, 17</a> the writer refers to human methods of ratifying solemn engagements, in order to illustrate a course of proceeding on another occasion condescendingly adopted by God<span class="cmt_word">. Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be</span> (<span class="accented">when it hath been</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The Authorized Version has thus happily rendered the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, which is here transposed cut of its logical position, as it is also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-7.htm">1 Corinthians 14:7</a>, and as <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>. The apostle's meaning is <span class="accented">that</span>, if even men are constrained by their sense of justice to abide by this rule, much more may the All-righteous One be expected to do so. This <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> suggestion (for St. Paul only hints this consideration by introducing the word <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> without explicitly developing it) is similar to the <span class="accented">afortiori</span> argument more explicitly stated by our Lord with reference to God's justice, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-6.htm">Luke 18:6, 7</a>; and to his fatherliness, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-13.htm">Luke 11:13</a>. "Covenant." The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, properly "disposition," which, in classical Greek, generally means "will," "testament," is used in the Septuagint to render the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span>, covenant, in which sense it occurs once in Aristophanes, 'Ayes,' 439; and it appears to denote "covenant" in all the thirty-three places in which it is found in the New Testament; for even <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-17.htm">Hebrews 9:17</a> can hardly be allowed to be an exception. Bishop Lightfoot observes that the Septuagint translators and the New Testament writers probably preferred <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, the ordinary Greek word for "covenant," when speaking of a Divine dispensation, because, like "promise," it better expresses the free grace of God. Perhaps the terms appeared to them more suitable also in this application, because one of the parties to the engagement was no other than the supreme sovereign Disposer of all things. "Confirmed;" ratified; as it were, signed, sealed, and delivered. "No one;" meaning neither of the two covenanting parties. "Addeth thereto;" addeth any fresh condition, such as would clog the action of the previous engagement. The apostle adds this with reference to the supposition that the Law of Moses might have qualified the Abrahamic covenant by limiting its benefits to persons ceremonially clean. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:15-18 The covenant God made with Abraham, was not done away by the giving the law to Moses. The covenant was made with Abraham and his Seed. It is still in force; Christ abideth for ever in his person, and his spiritual seed, who are his by faith. By this we learn the difference between the promises of the law and those of the gospel. The promises of the law are made to the person of every man; the promises of the gospel are first made to Christ, then by him to those who are by faith ingrafted into Christ. Rightly to divide the word of truth, a great difference must be put between the promise and the law, as to the inward affections, and the whole practice of life. When the promise is mingled with the law, it is made nothing but the law. Let Christ be always before our eyes, as a sure argument for the defence of faith, against dependence on human righteousness.</body></html>
