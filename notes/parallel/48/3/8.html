Such appears to be the general scope of the passage; but the verbal details are not free from difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Scripture, foreseeing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>); <span class="accented">and</span>, <span class="accented">again</span>, <span class="accented">the Scripture</span>, <span class="accented">foreseeing.</span> The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> indicates transition to another item of proof, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. The word "Scripture" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a>, "no prophecy of Scripture," certainly denotes the sacred writings as taken collectively, that is, what is frequently recited by the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, "the Scriptures." So probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-22.htm">Acts 8:22</a>, "the passage of Scripture." We are, therefore, war, anted in supposing it possible, and being possible it is here also probable, that this is the sense in which the apostle now uses the term as well as in ver. 22, rather than as denoting, either the one particular passage cited or the particular book out of which it is taken. This view better suits the personification under which the Old Testament is here presented. This personification groups with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>, "The Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up." In both cases the "Scripture" is put in place of the announcement which Scripture records as having been made, the Scripture itself being written after the time of both Abraham and Pharaoh, and not addressed to them. But here there is the additional feature, of foresight being attributed to Scripture - a foresight, net exactly of the Holy Spirit inspiring the Scripture, but of the Divine Being who, on the occasion referred to, was holding communication with Abraham; although, yet again, "the Scripture" seems in the words, "foreseeing that God would justify," etc., distinguished from "God." The sense, however, is clear; Scripture shows that, as early as the time of Abraham, a Divine intimation was given that God would, on the ground of faith simply, justify any human being throughout the world that should believe in him as Abraham did. Rabbinical scholars tell us that in those writings a citation from Scripture is frequently introduced with the words, "What sees the Scripture?" or, "What sees he [or, 'it']?" <span class="cmt_word">That God would justify the heathen through faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">that by</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">out of</span>) <span class="accented">faith would God justify the nations.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> betokens that the apostle's point here is, not that God would justify the Gentiles, but that it was by faith that he would do so irrespectively of any fulfilment on their part of ceremonial observances. The tense of the present indicative <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span> is hardly to be explained thus: would justify as we now see he is doing. The usual effect of the <span class="accented">oratio obliqua</span> transfers the standpoint of time in <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span> to the time of the foresight, the present tense being put instead of the future (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), as intimating that God was, so to speak, even now preparing thus to justify, or, in the Divine estimate of spaces of time, was on the eve of thus justifying; analogously with the force of the present tense in the participles "given" and "poured out" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19, 20</a>. The condition of mankind in the meanwhile is described in vers. 22, 23 - shut up unto the faith that was to be revealed. A question arises as to the exact interpretation of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as twice occurring in this verse. Does the apostle use it as the correlative to Jews, "Gentiles;" or without any such sense of contradistinction, "nations" including both Jews and Gentiles? In answer, we observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The great point in these verses (6-9) is, not the call of the Gentiles, but the efficacy of faith without Levitical ceremonialism, as summed up in the words of ver. 9. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The original passage which the apostle is now referring to is that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where the Septuagint, conformably with the Hebrew, has <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>: in our Authorized Version," And in thee shall all families [Hebrew, <span class="accented">mishpechoth</span>] of the earth be blessed:" only, through some cause or other, instead of "all families," he writes the words, "all nations" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), which we find in what was said by the Lord to the two angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>), <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> [that is, Abraham] <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>: Authorized Version, "all the nations of the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>, and the promise to Isaac, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>, are irrelevant to the point now under consideration). We, therefore, are warranted in assuming that, as <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="accented">might</span> be used as coextensive with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> ("families"), it really <span class="accented">is</span> here employed by the apostle with the same extension of application. We may add that, most certainly, the apostle utterly repudiated the notion that God justifies Gentiles on a different footing from that on which he justifies Jews: whether Jews or Gentiles, they only who are of faith are blessed with Abraham; and, whether Jews or Gentiles all who are of faith <span class="accented">are</span> blessed with him. <span class="cmt_word">Preached before the gospel unto Abraham</span>, saying (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham</span>, <span class="accented">saying.</span> Very striking and animated is the apostle's use of this word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, a compound verb, minted no doubt for the occasion out of his own ardent thought, though it is found also in his senior contemporary, Philo. It is plainly an allusion to the "gospel" now openly proclaimed to the world as having been "by anticipation" already then announced to Abraham, the Most High himself the herald; signifying also the joy which it brought to the patriarch, and (Chrysostom adds) his great desire for its accomplishment. Tim blessed and glorious gospel of the grace of God has been the thought of God in all ages. May we connect with this the mysterious passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8.htm">John 8</a>:567 In point of construction, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is nowhere else followed by <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>: but as it is sometimes found governing an accusative of the matter preached (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-42.htm">Acts 5:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>), there is no harshness in its construction with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which we may here represent in English by "saying." <span class="cmt_word">In thee shall all nations</span> <span class="cmt_word">be blessed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>). "In thee" as their type and pattern, in respect both to the "blessing" bestowed upon him and to the faith out of which his blessing sprang. The "blessing" consists of God's love and all the well-being which can flow from God's love; the form of well-being varying according to the believer's circumstances, whether in this life or in the life  to come; it receives its consummation with the final utterance, "Come, ye blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Into this condition of blessedness the sinful and guilty can only be brought through justification; but justification through Christ does of necessary consequence bring us into it. The compound form of the verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;</span>, added to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, forcibly indicates that moral inherency in Abraham, through our being in faith and obedience his spiritual offspring, whereby alone the blessing is attained and possessed. Chrysostom remarks, "If, then, those were Abraham's sons, not who were related to him by blood, but who follow his faith, for this is the meaning of the words, 'In thee all nations,' it is plain that the Gentiles are brought into kindred with him." Augustine explains "in thee," similarly: "To wit, by imitation of his faith by which he was justified even before the sacrament of circumcision." Luther writes "In Abraham are we blessed, but in what Abraham? The believing Abraham, to wit; because if we are not in Abraham, we are under a curse rather, even if we were in Abraham according to the flesh." Calvin likewise: "These words beyond all doubt mean that all must become objects of blessing after Abraham's fashion; for he is the common pattern, nay rather, rule. But he by faith obtained blessing; therefore faith is for all the means." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-14 The apostle proves the doctrine he had blamed the Galatians for rejecting; namely, that of justification by faith without the works of the law. This he does from the example of Abraham, whose faith fastened upon the word and promise of God, and upon his believing he was owned and accepted of God as a righteous man. The Scripture is said to foresee, because the Holy Spirit that indited the Scripture did foresee. Through faith in the promise of God he was blessed; and it is only in the same way that others obtain this privilege. Let us then study the object, nature, and effects of Abraham's faith; for who can in any other way escape the curse of the holy law? The curse is against all sinners, therefore against all men; for all have sinned, and are become guilty before God: and if, as transgressors of the law, we are under its curse, it must be vain to look for justification by it. Those only are just or righteous who are freed from death and wrath, and restored into a state of life in the favour of God; and it is only through faith that persons become righteous. Thus we see that justification by faith is no new doctrine, but was taught in the church of God, long before the times of the gospel. It is, in truth, the only way wherein any sinners ever were, or can be justified. Though deliverance is not to be expected from the law, there is a way open to escape the curse, and regain the favour of God, namely, through faith in Christ. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law; being made sin, or a sin-offering, for us, he was made a curse for us; not separated from God, but laid for a time under the Divine punishment. The heavy sufferings of the Son of God, more loudly warn sinners to flee from the wrath to come, than all the curses of the law; for how can God spare any man who remains under sin, seeing that he spared not his own Son, when our sins were charged upon him? Yet at the same time, Christ, as from the cross, freely invites sinners to take refuge in him.</body></html>
