He will only place the present conduct of the Galatians in contrast with their past, and ask how they can possibly reconcile the two.<p><span class= "bld">Received ye the Spirit.</span>--The reference is to those spiritual gifts, described more fully in 1 Corinthians 12, 14--the gift of prophecy, the gift of tongues, the interpretation of tongues, the discerning of spirits, gifts of healing, &c.--which attended the first preaching of the gospel, and were poured out upon the first converts in a manner and degree since unknown. The Galatians, it seems, had had a share in this outpouring, like the other churches, though their fickleness prevented them from reaping the full benefit from it. But a spiritual effect, such as this outpouring was, could only have a spiritual cause; it could not come from a mechanical performance of legal obligations.<p><span class= "bld">By the works of the law.</span>--By works done in obedience to the Law. There is a certain emphasis on both words, for the main point in the contrast which the Apostle is drawing is between the Law, on the one hand, and faith, on the other. Still, faith is as much opposed to works (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a spirit of literal and mechanical obedience) as it is to Law, and excludes both at once. It is to be noted, however, that the works here meant are those done, in a Judaising sense, as themselves the direct means of salvation--not Christian works, the natural product and outcome of faith.<p><span class= "bld">By the hearing of faith.</span>--These words correspond very nearly to a phrase which we should perhaps use more naturally: <span class= "ital">by the preaching of faith</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by that preaching or hearing (hearing on the part of the recipients, preaching on that of the missionary Apostles) which has for its subject faith. What the Apostle had taught the Galatians on his first coming among them was not any system of laborious observances, but the duty of faith. They at first responded to his teaching: and in answer to their enthusiastic impulse of adhesion to Christ the gifts of the Spirit were abundantly shed upon them. Now all this had ceased.

Had there a word been then spoken touching meats or drinks, or washings of purification (besides your baptism into Christ), or circumcision, or care of ceremonial cleanness? Had you attended to any one point whatever of Levitical ordinance? Had either you or I cast one thought in that direction? The "works of the Law" here referred to must still be works of <span class="accented">ceremonial</span> performance, not those of moral obedience; for repentance, the practical breaking off from sin, the surrender of the soul to God and to Christ in faith and loyal obedience, the outward assuming of the character of God's servants, the purpose and inchoate performance of works meet for repentance, - these dotings of compliance with the <span class="accented">moral</span> Law <span class="accented">were</span> there. The gift of the Spirit was <span class="accented">evidenced</span> by charisms plainly supernatural; but it comprised more than the bestowment of these. <span class="cmt_word">Or by the hearing of faith?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>;); <span class="accented">or was it in consequence of the hearing of faith</span>? The noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;</span> denotes sometimes (what is heard) "report," "rumour," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16, 17</a>; sometimes, especially in the plural, the organs or sense of hearing, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-35.htm">Mark 7:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-20.htm">Acts 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3, 4</a>; sometimes the act of hearing, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> (Septuagint). The last appears more suitable here than the first taken (as some take it) as describing the doctrine or message which they heard respecting faith; standing as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;</span> does in contrast to "works" which would have been an acting of theirs, this likewise was most probably meant by the apostle subjectively of something appearing on their own part. "Were you not at once received into the kingdom of God and filled with joy in the Holy Spirit, immediately upon your believing acceptance of the gospel message?" With exquisite propriety, as Bengel observes, is hereby marked the nature of faith, not working, but receiving. This agrees also best with the illustration which in ver. 6 the apostle gives of the phrase as introduced by him again in ver. 5. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Several things made the folly of the Galatian Christians worse. They had the doctrine of the cross preached, and the Lord's supper administered among them, in both which Christ crucified, and the nature of his sufferings, had been fully and clearly set forth. Had they been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, by the ministration of the law, or on account of any works done by them in obedience thereto? Was it not by their hearing and embracing the doctrine of faith in Christ alone for justification? Which of these had God owned with tokens of his favour and acceptance? It was not by the first, but the last. And those must be very unwise, who suffer themselves to be turned away from the ministry and doctrine which have been blessed to their spiritual advantage. Alas, that men should turn from the all-important doctrine of Christ crucified, to listen to useless distinctions, mere moral preaching, or wild fancies! The god of this world, by various men and means, has blinded men's eyes, lest they should learn to trust in a crucified Saviour. We may boldly demand where the fruits of the Holy Spirit are most evidently brought forth? whether among those who preach justification by the works of the law, or those who preach the doctrine of faith? Assuredly among the latter.</body></html>
