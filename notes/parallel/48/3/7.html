He has, however, also in view the ulterior consequences of that superiority. Unlike the Law, faith is open to all Gentiles as well as Jews. The promise, therefore, being annexed to faith, contained the death-blow of all those exclusive privileges which the Judaising party in Galatia claimed for themselves, and of all those burdensome regulations which they were for imposing upon the Galatian Christians. This, too, the Apostle brings out by showing that the believers in Christ, whatever their nationality, are the true spiritual descendants of Abraham.<p><span class= "bld">Know ye.</span>--The verb here may either be in the indicative or in the imperative: "know ye," or "ye know."

The categorical imperative seems of the two the more suited to the apostle's impetuous temperament. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, like the Latin <span class="accented">nosco</span>, properly denotes "to come to know," "learn," "perceive," "get apprised;" <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, like now, having more properly the sense of "knowing." But this distinction does not always hold, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That they which are of faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">that the men of faith</span>; that is, who derive their position from faith, belong to faith, are above all things characterized by faith. Compare the expressions, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "the men of factiousness, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "factions men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "the man of faith in Jesus," taking his stand thereupon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>). Closely affine to this usage of the preposition, if not quite the same, is, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "that is of the truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "they which are of the Law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-14.htm">Romans 4:14</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, (ver. 10 of this chapter). <span class="cmt_word">The same are the children of Abraham</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>); <span class="accented">these are sons of Abraham.</span> The form of expression is precisely the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span>) these are sons of God." In both cases the absence of the article before <span class="accented">viol</span> suggests the feeling that the apostle is simply stating a predicate of the class before defined, but not now affirming that this predicate is confined to that class, although, again in each case, he knew that it was so confined. Just here, what he is concerned to affirm is that the possession of faith is a complete and sufficient qualification for sonship to Abraham. There is, perhaps, a polemical reference to the teaching of certain in Galatia, that, to be sons of Abraham or interested in God's covenant with his people, it behoved men to be circumcised and to observe the ceremonial Law. This error would be satisfactorily met by the affirmation of the present verse, that the being believers, simply this, constitutes men <span class="accented">sons</span> of Abraham. In the tenth verse the apostle goes further, aggressively denying to those who "were of the works of the Law" the possession at all of Abrahamic privilege. The class, "men of <span class="accented">faith</span>," did in fact include Jewish believers as well as Gentile; but just hero, as seems probable from what is said in the next verse, the apostle has in view Gentile believers only. The writer's thoughts are hovering round that promise of God ("So shall thy seed be") which had been on that particular occasion the object of Abraham's faith. That this was the case we may infer from his citation of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-18.htm">Romans 4:18</a>, the explanation of which had been prepared for by him in what he has said before in ver. 16, "To the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed: not to that only which is of the Law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all." It was this that led him to speak of being sons of Abraham. This train of thought is pursued further in the next two verses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-14 The apostle proves the doctrine he had blamed the Galatians for rejecting; namely, that of justification by faith without the works of the law. This he does from the example of Abraham, whose faith fastened upon the word and promise of God, and upon his believing he was owned and accepted of God as a righteous man. The Scripture is said to foresee, because the Holy Spirit that indited the Scripture did foresee. Through faith in the promise of God he was blessed; and it is only in the same way that others obtain this privilege. Let us then study the object, nature, and effects of Abraham's faith; for who can in any other way escape the curse of the holy law? The curse is against all sinners, therefore against all men; for all have sinned, and are become guilty before God: and if, as transgressors of the law, we are under its curse, it must be vain to look for justification by it. Those only are just or righteous who are freed from death and wrath, and restored into a state of life in the favour of God; and it is only through faith that persons become righteous. Thus we see that justification by faith is no new doctrine, but was taught in the church of God, long before the times of the gospel. It is, in truth, the only way wherein any sinners ever were, or can be justified. Though deliverance is not to be expected from the law, there is a way open to escape the curse, and regain the favour of God, namely, through faith in Christ. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law; being made sin, or a sin-offering, for us, he was made a curse for us; not separated from God, but laid for a time under the Divine punishment. The heavy sufferings of the Son of God, more loudly warn sinners to flee from the wrath to come, than all the curses of the law; for how can God spare any man who remains under sin, seeing that he spared not his own Son, when our sins were charged upon him? Yet at the same time, Christ, as from the cross, freely invites sinners to take refuge in him.</body></html>
