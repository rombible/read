This would include the two periods of the sojourn of the patriarchs in Canaan and the sojourn in Egypt. According to another system of chronology, the sojourn in Egypt alone occupied four hundred and thirty--or, in round numbers, four hundred--years. Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a>, Abraham is warned that his seed is to be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and to be afflicted "four hundred years." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a> it is expressly stated that "the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-6.htm" title="And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.">Acts 7:6</a> the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a> is quoted: the people were to be "entreated evil four hundred years." It is noticeable, however, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a>, which is the least ambiguous of the three passages, the L.XX. and Samaritan Pentateuch add, "and in the land of Canaan," so as to make the four hundred and thirty years cover the whole of the two periods, in agreement with the present passage. It has been thought that an examination of the genealogy of Levi favours the same reckoning. It would seem, however, that there were two systems of chronology really current. Josephus adopts both in different parts of his writings (comp. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 15, ? 2, with <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 9, ? 1; <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> v. 9, ? 4), and both are represented in other writers of the period, or not very much later. It is possible that the shorter reckoning may have arisen from difficulties observed in the longer, though it may be questioned whether it does not raise greater difficulties itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> [Receptus adds, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>]); <span class="accented">and I say this</span>: <span class="accented">a covenant confirmed before of God.</span> We have here the application of the aphorism laid down in ver. 15. "And I say this;" that is," And what I have to say is this." As God had already before made a solemn covenant with Abraham and his seed, the Law given so long after cannot have been intended to do away with it; fundamental principles of even human civil equity disallow of any such procedure. "Confirmed before." If the confirmation or ratification is to be distinguished as additional to the solemn announcement, we may find it either in the "seal" of circumcision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>), or in the oath "with which God interposed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17</a>) after the sacrifice of Isaac. The words <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "with reference to Christ," are expunged from the text by most recent editors. If genuine, they would seem intended to emphasize that position of "Christ" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in effect his Church) as future copartner with Abraham, which has been already affirmed in the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">The Law, which was four hundred and thirty years after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> [Receptus reads <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, instead of here, with no difference to the sense] <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">the Law</span>, <span class="accented">having come into existence four hundred and thirty years after.</span> This number of years the apostle finds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40, 41</a>. In the Hebrew text of that passage this term of four hundred and thirty years defines the stay of the Israelites" in Egypt." But in the Septuagint, as well as in the Samaritan text, the term defines the sojourn of the Israelites ("themselves and their fathers" is, according to Tischendorf, added in the Alexandrian manuscript) "in the laud of Egypt and in the land of Canaan." With the view presented by this Septuagintal version agrees a definite statement of Josephus ('Ant.,' 2:15, 2), "They left Egypt... four hundred and thirty years after our forefather Abraham came into Canaan, but two hundred and fifteen years only after Jacob removed into Egypt." In two other passages, however ('Ant.,' 2:09, 1; 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:09, 4), Josephus speaks of the affliction in Egypt as lasting "four hundred years;" probably following in this computation the period mentioned in the Divine communication recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>, and cited by St. Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-6.htm">Acts 7:6</a>) in his defence. It is unnecessary here to attempt to determine the chronological question, which is one not free from difficulty. Our readers are referred to some valuable observations of Canon Cook's, in his note on Exodus 12:40; who on apparently strong grounds considers that a longer period than two hundred and fifteen years must be allowed for the sojourn in Egypt (see, however, Mr. Reginald S. Peele's article, "Chronology," in 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 321,322). If the Hebrew text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a> as we have it is correct, and if the Septuagintal version of it errs in including the sojourn of the patriarchs <span class="accented">in Canoan</span> in the there mentioned period of four hundred and thirty years, then the number of years which the apostle here specifies, counting apparently from Abraham's arrival in Canaan when he received the first of the promises cited above in the note on ver. 16, is less than he would have been justified in stating by the interval between Abraham's arrival in Canaan and Jacob's going down into Egypt. But, however, even if the apostle's mind adverted to this particular point at all, which may or may not have been the case, it plainly would not have been worth his while to surprise and perplex his readers by specifying a number of years different from that which they found in the Greek Bible, which both he and they were accustomed to use, even though the greater number would have in a slight degree added to the force of his argument. <span class="cmt_word">Cannot dis-annul</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>); <span class="accented">doth not disannul.</span> The present tense is used, because the apostle is describing the present position. <span class="cmt_word">That it should make the promise of none effect</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The "covenant" is here to a certain degree distinguished from "the promise." The latter, being the fundamental and characteristic portion of the former, is brought prominently forward, for the purpose of illustrating the character of the Christian economy as being above all things one of grace and gratuitous bestowment. The feeling also, perhaps, underlies the words that with one of generous spirit - and who so large-hearted and munificent as God? - in proportion as a promise which he has given is large and spontaneous, and the expectation raised by it eager and joyous, in that proportion is it impossible for him to baulk the promisee of his hope. The "promise" was "To thee and to thy seed will I give this land;" the "<span class="accented">covenant</span>," that Jehovah would be their God, and that they should recognize him as such. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:15-18 The covenant God made with Abraham, was not done away by the giving the law to Moses. The covenant was made with Abraham and his Seed. It is still in force; Christ abideth for ever in his person, and his spiritual seed, who are his by faith. By this we learn the difference between the promises of the law and those of the gospel. The promises of the law are made to the person of every man; the promises of the gospel are first made to Christ, then by him to those who are by faith ingrafted into Christ. Rightly to divide the word of truth, a great difference must be put between the promise and the law, as to the inward affections, and the whole practice of life. When the promise is mingled with the law, it is made nothing but the law. Let Christ be always before our eyes, as a sure argument for the defence of faith, against dependence on human righteousness.</body></html>
