It was a sort of measure of police. Its object was to deal with transgressions. It was also a temporary measure, of force only until it should be superseded by the coming of the Messiah. Unlike the promise, too, it was a contract. It was given by a mediator--that is, a person acting between two parties. Two parties were involved, with rigid conditions binding them both. On the other hand, the promise was given unconditionally by the sole act of God.<p>In stating the true function of the Law, the Apostle brings out its inferiority to the promise in four respects. (1) It dealt with sins, not with holiness; (2) it was temporary and transitory; (3) it was given, not directly, but indirectly, through the double mediation of the angels and of Moses; (4) it was conditional, and not like the promise, unconditional. It depended upon the fallible action of man, and not only upon the infallible word of God.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">Wherefore then serveth the law?</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">What then is the Law?</span> What is its object or function? If it did not affect the promise, what did it do? The Apostle proceeds to answer this question.<p><span class= "bld">It was added.</span>--It was not a part of the original scheme, but came in as a sort of marginal addition. It was, as it were, a parenthesis in the design of Providence. The direct line of God's dealings with man ran through the promise and its fulfilment. The Law came in by the way.<p><span class= "bld">Because of transgressions.</span>--It has been usual to give to this one of two opposite interpretations, to make it mean (1) to check or put down transgressions; (2) to multiply and increase transgressions, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>. The expression seems wide enough to cover both ideas. The Law was given "<span class= "ital">because of transgressions</span>:" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> it <span class= "ital">had its object in</span> transgressions. Its original purpose was to make them known, and by imposing a penalty to check them; its real effect was to provoke and enhance them. The expression "because of transgressions" leaves it ambiguous which of these points is meant, or rather, it includes them all.<p><span class= "bld">Till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.</span>--By "the seed" is meant, as above, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.

He shined forth from mount Paran, and He came with ten thousands of saints." For "saints" the LXX. substitutes, in the next verse, "angels." Similar allusions are found at the end of St. Stephen's speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>): "Who have received the law by the disposition (as ordinances) of angels, and have not kept it;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a> : "If the word spoken by (<span class= "ital">through</span>) angels was stedfast." In this last instance, as in the present passage, the ministration of angels employed in it is quoted as showing the inferiority of the Law to the Gospel. In St. Stephen's speech and in Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 5, 3) the same ministration is appealed to as enhancing the dignity of the Law.

Many of the fathers, following Origen, took the mediator here to be Christ, and were thus thrown out in their interpretation of the whole passage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore then serveth the Law?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>;); <span class="accented">what then</span> (or, <span class="accented">why then</span>) <span class="accented">is the Law</span>? The apostle is wont thus to introduce the statement of some objection or some question relative to the point in hand which requires consideration (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm">Romans 4:1</a>). He wishes now to show that, while the Law was a Divine ordinance, it was yet not intended to supersede the previously ratified covenant, but rather to prepare for its being completely carried out. <span class="cmt_word">It was added because of transgressions</span> (<span class="greek_word">tw = n</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">on account of transgressions it was superadded.</span> As <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> denotes that so-and-so is done in consideration of this or that; this latter may be either some antecedent fact furnishing ground for subsequent action, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-47.htm">Luke 7:47</a>, or some prospective result, which the action signified in the verb is intended to forward, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a>. Here it intimates that the Law was given from a regard to men's sinful actions, with an implied contrast with the covenant of Christ's gospel, which was concerned with men's justification and benediction. The province of the Law is to expose sins, rebuke them, pronounce God's curse upon them, coerce and restrain them by the discipline of a system of outward rites and ceremonies. The office of the Law, as dealing with sinners as continuing sinful, while unable to make them new creatures, is indicated by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>, where, after saying, "The Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners," he proceeds to add a catalogue of offenders chargeable with the grossest form of criminality; which furnishes a most apt illustration of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("transgressions") which he here uses, and which marks sins in their most wilful and most condemnable character. What was spiritually the outcome of the Law's action upon men's sinful nature, in making their "sin exceeding sinful," the apostle has vividly portrayed in the seventh chapter of the Romans. This last point, however, is probably not even glanced at here; and it is only by straining the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, that some commentators, notably Meyer, find the apostle to be here stating that the Law was added for the behoof of transgressions, as it were in their interest, to increase and intensify them, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>, that the trespass might abound. This, however, is not naturally found in the present passage. All that the apostle here states is that the Law merely dealt with sins, having no function in relation to life and righteousness. The article before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> indicates the whole class of objects referred to, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). This" superadded" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) is not inconsistent with the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "nor addeth thereto," of ver. 15; inasmuch as it points to a Divine ordinance, which stood, so to speak, in a different plane from the covenant of grace, and in no way interfered with it. <span class="cmt_word">Till the</span> <span class="cmt_word">seed should come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The form of expression indicates the purpose of him who arranged it all, that the Law should last only so long, and was to come to an end when the seed came. <span class="cmt_word">To whom the promise</span> <span class="cmt_word">was made</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">to whom the promise hath been made.</span> The perfect tense of the verb, as in the case of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in ver. 18, points to the still continuing validity of the promise. The "seed" is "Christ;" the historical Christ, indeed, but still viewed collectively as summing up in himself all who should be united to him. <span class="cmt_word">And it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">being ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> The verb "ordain" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), being most commonly used for "command," "order," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-55.htm">Luke 8:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-17.htm">1 Corinthians 7:17</a>, is introduced in preference to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. ver. 20 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-19.htm">John 7:19</a>), as making more prominent the notion of <span class="accented">imperative</span> action on the part of the Divine Lawgiver. The whole passage is tinctured with the feeling that the giving of the Law, as contrasted with the dispensation of the Messiah, was marked by distance, sternness, alienation. This is the meaning of the mention of "angels" as the medium of communication on the side of Heaven, and of "a mediator" as the selected medium of reception on the side of Israel (compare the contrast between the two dispensations in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>). This representation of the Law as given through angels is unmistakably made again in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in the words, "The word spoken through angels" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>), where also it is placed in the same contrast with the gospel as spoken by the Lord Jesus, which here is plainly <span class="accented">implied</span>, if indeed it is not expressly alluded to, in the enigmatic words, "but God is one," in the next verse. This view of the Law as communicated through the medium of angels is distinctly referred to by St. Stephen as the accepted belief of the Jewish theologians before whom he spoke: "Ye who received the Law as the ordinances of angels" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>), where the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, forms a remarkable parallel to the words, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, now before us. The same view is put forth by Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:05, 3), "We having learned the most excellent of our doctrines and the most holy part of our Law through angels from God." Such, then, was incontestably the current belief of the Jewish people, both Christian and non-Christian. The Hebrew theologians directed a great deal of attention upon the doctrine of angels, of which the "boundless genealogies" spoken of by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>) was certainly one diseased branch. We may without improbability suppose that their exegetical sagacity, not unaided by the Spirit of God promised by him to his people upon their restoration from Captivity, detected the particular fact here indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16, 19</a>. The countless hosts of his "saints" who attended upon the Lord on that occasion were not surely mere spectators; and to their intervention acting out the volitions of God might be most reasonably ascribed all the physical sights and sounds which gave to the giving of the Law its sensible awfulness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). "They raised the fire and smoke; they shook and rent the rock; they framed the sound of the trumpet; they effected the articulate voices which conveyed the words of the Law to the ears of the people, and therein proclaimed and published the Law; whereby it became ' the word spoken by angels'" (Owen, 'Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews,' 2:2). <span class="cmt_word">In the hand of a mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, in or by the hand, is unquestionably a Hebraism, being in the Septuagint the ordinary literal rendering of the Hebrew <span class="accented">beyad</span>; see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-37.htm">Numbers 4:37, 45</a>; which passages likewise show us whom the apostle means to designate as the mediator; in reference to which comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>, "I stood between (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) the Lord and you at that time [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the giving of the Law], to show you the word of the Lord." So Philo ('Vit. Mos.,' 678) speaks of Hoses as acting like a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "mediator and reconciler." Schottgen ('Hor. Hebr.') gives numerous examples from the rabbinical books of this application of the term "mediator "to Moses. This conception of Moses as a mediator seems <span class="accented">implied</span> also in the words, "Mediator of a better covenant" and "Mediator of a new covenant," which we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a> and Hebrews 12:24, with reference to Christ. Evidently the mention of a mediator in the present passage is intended to point to the relations between the Lord and Israel as being those of distance and estrangement. If it be objected that the same inference would be deducible from the description of Christ as "Mediator between God and men," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, we have it to say, in answer, that Christ, being in his nature both God and man, not only mediates between God and men, having made atonement or reconciliation by his cross, but in his own being unites God and man, abolishing actually that state of mutual alienation which the mediation of Moses by figure implied but could not in reality do away. We, too, were enemies to God before we were reconciled by the death of his Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>); but now, being reconciled, we are at one with God in Christ: Christ's life in our nature both guaranteeing and effectuating our continued state of reconciliation with the Father as well as our own spiritual and eternal life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:19-22 If that promise was enough for salvation, wherefore then serveth the law? The Israelites, though chosen to be God's peculiar people, were sinners as well as others. The law was not intended to discover a way of justification, different from that made known by the promise, but to lead men to see their need of the promise, by showing the sinfulness of sin, and to point to Christ, through whom alone they could be pardoned and justified. The promise was given by God himself; the law was given by the ministry of angels, and the hand of a mediator, even Moses. Hence the law could not be designed to set aside the promise. A mediator, as the very term signifies, is a friend that comes between two parties, and is not to act merely with and for one of them. The great design of the law was, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to those that believe; that, being convinced of their guilt, and the insufficiency of the law to effect a righteousness for them, they might be persuaded to believe on Christ, and so obtain the benefit of the promise. And it is not possible that the holy, just, and good law of God, the standard of duty to all, should be contrary to the gospel of Christ. It tends every way to promote it.</body></html>
