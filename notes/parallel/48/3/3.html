It had none of that sublime expansiveness and aspiration which belongs to faith.

"weak and beggarly rudiments," <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; and for the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>). Perhaps the apostle includes also in his use of the term the loss of spiritual victory over sin. if in place of surrendering themselves to the leading of the Spirit (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-18.htm">Galatians 5:18</a>) they put themselves under the Law, then they fell back again under the power of the "flesh," which the Law could only <span class="accented">command</span> them to control, but could of itself give them no <span class="accented">power to</span> control (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>). The Authorized Version, "begun in," is doubtless faulty, in taking <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as governed by the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> of the compound verb.

The latter seems the more suitable, with the understood suppletion of "your course" or "your estate," as in our English word "finishing." The apostle is partial to the deponent form of verbs. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Several things made the folly of the Galatian Christians worse. They had the doctrine of the cross preached, and the Lord's supper administered among them, in both which Christ crucified, and the nature of his sufferings, had been fully and clearly set forth. Had they been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, by the ministration of the law, or on account of any works done by them in obedience thereto? Was it not by their hearing and embracing the doctrine of faith in Christ alone for justification? Which of these had God owned with tokens of his favour and acceptance? It was not by the first, but the last. And those must be very unwise, who suffer themselves to be turned away from the ministry and doctrine which have been blessed to their spiritual advantage. Alas, that men should turn from the all-important doctrine of Christ crucified, to listen to useless distinctions, mere moral preaching, or wild fancies! The god of this world, by various men and means, has blinded men's eyes, lest they should learn to trust in a crucified Saviour. We may boldly demand where the fruits of the Holy Spirit are most evidently brought forth? whether among those who preach justification by the works of the law, or those who preach the doctrine of faith? Assuredly among the latter.</body></html>
