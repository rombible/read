It could not justify. For the condition of justification is faith; and the Law has nothing to do with faith. Its standpoint was entirely different--that of works.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">In the sight of God.</span>--Standing as a prisoner before His tribunal.<p><span class= "bld">The just shall live by faith.</span>--The stress is on the word "faith." It is <span class= "ital">faith</span> (not law) which gives life. In St. Paul's application of the passage, the word "just" must be taken in what is technically termed a slightly proleptic sense. A man is not just <span class= "ital">before</span> the exercise of faith, but he <span class= "ital">becomes</span> just <span class= "ital">by</span> the exercise of it; and, in another aspect, the state of righteousness upon which he then enters is also a state of life. Strictly speaking, the order is--faith, justification, life. It would be possible to take the Greek in such a way as to bring out this more distinctly: "The just by faith" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> he whose righteousness is based on faith) "shall live." Some good commentators take the passage thus, but a balance of considerations seems, on the whole, to be in favour of the sense adopted in the Authorised version.<p>The quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm" title="Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, where it refers to the preservation of the righteous Israelite amidst the general ruin caused by the Chaldean invasion. Though the wicked and proud shall be destroyed, the righteous man shall live "by his faith." There is some division of opinion amongst commentators as to whether the word translated "faith" means, in the original, faith in the active sense or faith in the passive sense--"fidelity," "faithfulness," or "trust in God." The sense in which the word is used by St Paul is most nearly related to the latter. It has the full-developed Christian meaning, which begins in belief, includes trust, and passes on to become an active energy of devotion. (Comp. the Note and <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>, where the same quotation is made.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But that no man is justified by the Law in the sight of God, it is evident</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">but that in the Law no man is justified with God</span>, <span class="accented">is evident.</span> To "be justified" means to be brought out of a state of guiltiness and cursedness into a state of acceptance. The apostle, assuming that every one is guilty and under a curse, now shows that the Law offers no means of justification. "But." The apostle is meeting the notion that, though one who is of works of the Law is evermore threatened with a curse ready to light down upon him, and though the curse has been, as it cannot but have been, actually incurred, yet, by setting himself afresh to the endeavour and thenceforward continuing steadfast in all things written in the Law, he may thus win pardon and righteousness with God. To obviate this conception, without stopping to insist upon the fact that through indwelling sin no man possibly can continue in all the things written in the Law, he puts the notion aside by stating that this is not the method of justification which Scripture recognizes. This he shows by adducing that cardinal aphorism of Habakkuk, by which, as it should seem, the apostle was wont to substantiate the doctrine of justification by faith (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>). The way in which the passage is here introduced, almost as an <span class="accented">obiter dictum</span>, and as if not needing a formal indication of its coming out of Scripture, suggests the feeling that the passage, as taken in the sense in which the apostle reads it, was one already familiar to his readers, no doubt through his own former teaching. When in the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39-41</a>) we read that in the synagogue at the Pisidian Antioch, in close connection with the statement that through believing in Christ a man is justified, he cited another passage of Habakkuk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>), denouncing unbelieving despisers, we cannot doubt that he had made good his statement about justification by alleging this same probative text. "In the Law;" that is, as being it. the sphere and domain of the Law. Compare the use of the same preposition: <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>, "As many as have sinned under [Greek, 'in'] the Law;" 3:19, "It saith to them that are under [Greek, 'in'] the Law." An exactly parallel construction is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>, "From all things from which ye could not by [Greek, 'in'] the Law be justified." They could not as being in the Law find therein any means of gaining acceptance. "Is justified with God;" comes to be accounted righteous with him. "With God;" not merely outwardly, Levitically, in the judgment of a Levitical priest - but inwardly and in reality, in God's estimation. The preposition "with" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) is used similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>, "For not the hearers of the Law are righteous with God;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>, "The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God." It is God himself that justifies the sinner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-30.htm">Romans 3:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-5.htm">Romans 4:5</a>); but the apostle does not write "is justified by God," because he is confronting the notion so natural to man, and above all, to the Judaizing legalist, that a man is to make himself righteous by doings - ceremonial or moral - of his own. <span class="cmt_word">For, The just shall live by faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">the righteous by faith shall live.</span> The apostle is not weaving the prophet's words into his own sentence simply as aptly expressing his own thought, but is citing them probatively as words of Scripture; as if he had said, "As Scripture saith, The righteous," etc. The same is the case with the words introduced in the next verse out of Leviticus; so <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-3.htm">Romans 15:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a> the apostle inserts, "according as it is written," as in parenthesis, before adding the words of Scripture in such a way as to form a continuation of his own sentence. "The righteous by faith shall live;" that is, the righteous man shall draw his life from his faith. It is generally agreed upon by Hebrew scholars that in the original passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>) the words, "by his faith" (or possibly, adopting another reading of the Hebrew text, "by my faith," that is, by faith in me) belong to "shall live," rather than to "the righteous" (see on this point Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>, and Canon Cook on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, in 'Speaker's Commentary'). And that St. Paul so understood it is made probable by the contrasted citation of" shall live in them "in the next verse. With this conjunction of the words, the passage suits the apostle's purpose perfect]y; for if it is by or from his faith that the righteous man lives, then it is by or from his faith that he gets to be accepted by God as righteous. The "faith" spoken of is shown by the context in Habakkuk to mean such reliance upon God as is of a steadfast character, and not a mere fleeting or occasional acceptance of God's promises as true. This is plainly the view of the passage which is taken by the Pauline writer of the Hebrews in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-14 The apostle proves the doctrine he had blamed the Galatians for rejecting; namely, that of justification by faith without the works of the law. This he does from the example of Abraham, whose faith fastened upon the word and promise of God, and upon his believing he was owned and accepted of God as a righteous man. The Scripture is said to foresee, because the Holy Spirit that indited the Scripture did foresee. Through faith in the promise of God he was blessed; and it is only in the same way that others obtain this privilege. Let us then study the object, nature, and effects of Abraham's faith; for who can in any other way escape the curse of the holy law? The curse is against all sinners, therefore against all men; for all have sinned, and are become guilty before God: and if, as transgressors of the law, we are under its curse, it must be vain to look for justification by it. Those only are just or righteous who are freed from death and wrath, and restored into a state of life in the favour of God; and it is only through faith that persons become righteous. Thus we see that justification by faith is no new doctrine, but was taught in the church of God, long before the times of the gospel. It is, in truth, the only way wherein any sinners ever were, or can be justified. Though deliverance is not to be expected from the law, there is a way open to escape the curse, and regain the favour of God, namely, through faith in Christ. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law; being made sin, or a sin-offering, for us, he was made a curse for us; not separated from God, but laid for a time under the Divine punishment. The heavy sufferings of the Son of God, more loudly warn sinners to flee from the wrath to come, than all the curses of the law; for how can God spare any man who remains under sin, seeing that he spared not his own Son, when our sins were charged upon him? Yet at the same time, Christ, as from the cross, freely invites sinners to take refuge in him.</body></html>
