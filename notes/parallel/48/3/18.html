Here it relates to a spiritual possession. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> seems preferred by editors of the text, when used logically, as if it were, It no longer appears to be (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-17.htm">Romans 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-6.htm">Romans 11:6</a>); whereas <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> might be referred to a change which took place at the time when the Law was given. <span class="cmt_word">But God gave it to Abraham by promise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but God hath freely given it to Abraham by promise.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> emphatically marks a gilt as freely and lavishly bestowed (compare its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>). The perfect tense points to the now and evermore enduring effect of the promise. The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is emphatic - God, no less than he! (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>). The march of this sentence, with which the apostle closes up this paragraph of the discussion, gives, as it stands in the Greek, the reader to feel the apostle's soul dilating with wonder cud delight as he gives expression to the two notions - the gracious freeness of the gift, and the Divine personality of the Giver. The mention here of Abraham alone, without "his seed," is perhaps due to the apostle's sense of the long priority of this guaranteed bestowment to the giving of the Law. In appreciating the tone of the passage, we must not lose sight of the venerableness of this personage, the primordial father, not only of the Hebrew race, but of all believers in Christ to the end of the world. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:15-18 The covenant God made with Abraham, was not done away by the giving the law to Moses. The covenant was made with Abraham and his Seed. It is still in force; Christ abideth for ever in his person, and his spiritual seed, who are his by faith. By this we learn the difference between the promises of the law and those of the gospel. The promises of the law are made to the person of every man; the promises of the gospel are first made to Christ, then by him to those who are by faith ingrafted into Christ. Rightly to divide the word of truth, a great difference must be put between the promise and the law, as to the inward affections, and the whole practice of life. When the promise is mingled with the law, it is made nothing but the law. Let Christ be always before our eyes, as a sure argument for the defence of faith, against dependence on human righteousness.</body></html>
