(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-16.htm" title="But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;">Acts 2:16-21</a>.) The promise is said to be "received" by the generation on which it is fulfilled, not by that to which it is given. The same phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Two results are here stated as having flowed from the abrogation of the Mosaic Law which was effected by the crucifixion of Jesus: one, the participation of Gentiles in "Abraham's blessing," to which they could not have been admitted as long as the Law was authorized to shut them out from God's covenant as unclean; the other, the impartation to God's people, upon their faith only, apart from acts of ceremonial obedience, of the promised gift of the Holy Spirit. Are these stated as <span class="accented">co-ordinate</span> results, in the same way as a repeated <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> ("in order that") introduces co-ordinate results in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19, 20</a>? Or is the second a consequence of the first? In favour of the first view, it may be said that, in point of fact, Gentiles, as such, were not admitted into a participation in Abraham's blessing till some time after the day of Pentecost. But on the other hand, it may be urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, though not as yet actually admitted, yet in the Divine purpose, and in the ordering of the conditions of the case, they might have come in, - the door was open, though the threshold not actually crossed; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that their admissibility may be supposed to have been in the Divine counsels the prerequisite condition of the Holy Spirit being imparted, it not being fitting that the Spirit should be given so long as the Law was, so to speak, standing there, authorized to debar from this, the most essential portion of "Abraham's blessing," any who were partakers of Abraham's blessing. In the three passages referred to as favouring the construing of the two clauses as co-ordinate, we have not as here two different results, but one and the same, only in the second clause more fully described. The second view seems, therefore, the more probable one. <span class="cmt_word">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: so most recent editors read, in place of <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">that upon</span> "<span class="accented">the nations"</span> <span class="accented">might crone the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is illustrated by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, "arrive at," or "accrue to," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-17.htm">Acts 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-15.htm">Acts 25:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a>. For the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> we may also comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>, "Unto (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) all and upon (<span class="greek">&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>) all." By <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, as the whole context shows, the apostle means in particular "the Gentiles," the non-Jews, as such. At the same time, the <span class="accented">phrase</span> is evidently used, as found ready at hand in the passage cited by him in ver. 8, "In thee shall all the nations (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) be blessed," which passage also suggested the notion of "the blessing of Abraham." It had therein been foretold that all the nations should, by exercising the faith of Abraham, obtain the same blessing; and (says the apostle) we see now by what method the benefit has been brought to them. "In Christ Jesus;" not merely <span class="accented">by</span> him; the blessing is, so to speak, immanent in Christ. both procured by him and obtained by the nations through their coming by faith into union with him. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6, 7</a>, "His grace which he freely bestowed upon us <span class="accented">in</span> the Beloved; in whom we have our redemption;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>, "In him ye are made full;" and the like. "The blessing of Abraham." The expression, being drawn from the passages in Genesis in which the Lord assures Abraham that "he would bless him," and that "in him all nations should be blessed," must be taken to import the Divine good will and whatever benefits would therefrom result. Men arrive at t is "benediction" by being justified; but justification is only the entrance into it, and not the whole blessing itself. It is styled <span class="accented">Abraham's</span> blessing, as having been emphatically declared to have been possessed by the patriarch, "the father" of all who should thereafter receive it<span class="cmt_word">. That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). The pronoun "we" points, not to the Israelites as such, nor to Israelite believers in particular, but to those who were viewed as God's covenant people. These had hitherto been Abraham's natural seed only; and had also hitherto been under the Law. But the time had come when they were to receive the full "adoption of sons," and therewith the Spirit of God's Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5, 6</a>); which, however, could not come to pass until the Law, "the yoke of slavery," had been cleared out of the way, opening the gate to God's benediction to all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles. The Law and the Spirit could not coexist. Where the Law had sway, <span class="accented">there</span> was tutor-ship (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) and slavery. Such, it is true, was needed, so long as the Spirit was not there; for moral beings, forming a people of God's, must be under <span class="accented">some</span> Law; and, if there was not a law written on the "fleshy tables of the heart" by God's Spirit, there behoved to be one embodied in an outward code of ordinances, which should coerce men's frowardness and keep them under discipline. But when this outward code had been taken out of the way," nailed to Christ's cross," then the people of God could not be left without the Spirit - the Spirit of holiness, as well as, or rather, because also, the Spirit of adoption; which accordingly was forthwith imparted, the sole condition of the bestowment being their living obedient faith, felt and by baptism professed, in Christ and in God. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13-18</a>, as containing a full presentment of these facts relative to the introduction of the new covenant, and in the same order of sequence. Thus the apostle has triumphantly returned to the thesis from which he had started in the two first verses of the chapter - Christ crucified, and the receiving of the Spirit without works of the Law. "The promise of the Spirit" is the Spirit which had been promised; the word "promise" here denoting, not as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a>, the word assuring a subsequent bestowment, but as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>, the bestowment itself. The apostle points not merely to such passages of the Old Testament as had definitely fore-announced the outpouring of God's Spirit (Joel 2:38; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>; and the like), but the whole "kingdom of God," or "world to come," whose blessedness therewith came. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:6-14 The apostle proves the doctrine he had blamed the Galatians for rejecting; namely, that of justification by faith without the works of the law. This he does from the example of Abraham, whose faith fastened upon the word and promise of God, and upon his believing he was owned and accepted of God as a righteous man. The Scripture is said to foresee, because the Holy Spirit that indited the Scripture did foresee. Through faith in the promise of God he was blessed; and it is only in the same way that others obtain this privilege. Let us then study the object, nature, and effects of Abraham's faith; for who can in any other way escape the curse of the holy law? The curse is against all sinners, therefore against all men; for all have sinned, and are become guilty before God: and if, as transgressors of the law, we are under its curse, it must be vain to look for justification by it. Those only are just or righteous who are freed from death and wrath, and restored into a state of life in the favour of God; and it is only through faith that persons become righteous. Thus we see that justification by faith is no new doctrine, but was taught in the church of God, long before the times of the gospel. It is, in truth, the only way wherein any sinners ever were, or can be justified. Though deliverance is not to be expected from the law, there is a way open to escape the curse, and regain the favour of God, namely, through faith in Christ. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law; being made sin, or a sin-offering, for us, he was made a curse for us; not separated from God, but laid for a time under the Divine punishment. The heavy sufferings of the Son of God, more loudly warn sinners to flee from the wrath to come, than all the curses of the law; for how can God spare any man who remains under sin, seeing that he spared not his own Son, when our sins were charged upon him? Yet at the same time, Christ, as from the cross, freely invites sinners to take refuge in him.</body></html>
