It is not as if you were ignorant of better things. The crucified Saviour, the one great object of faith, has been preached before you in a way too plain to be mistaken. It has been written, as it were, in large characters before your eyes. It could only be some kind of evil enchantment or fascination that has prevented you from looking upon it. You have given up Christ and gone back to the Law. Yet, let me ask you--and surely no other proof is needed--all this outpouring of spiritual gifts that you have enjoyed since you became Christian, to what do you owe it? Is that due to the Law and works, or is it due to Christ and faith in Him? The one system is spiritual, the other is carnal and material. Will you begin with what is high and descend to what is low? Will you by such a declension practically admit that all the persecutions that you underwent were undergone in a mistaken cause? (I can hardly believe it.) At this present moment the gift of spiritual grace and miraculous power still in some measure continues, and where it is seen, is it not in clear connection--not with legal observances--but with faith in Christ?<p>In the last section of the last chapter the Apostle had been gradually working away from the historical retrospect with which he had begun to the doctrinal polemic in which he is about to engage, and now he addresses the Galatians with impassioned directness and earnestness, upbraiding them with their shameful apostasy.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Foolish.</span>--The same word as that which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25</a>, "O ye fools and slow of heart," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm" title="I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.">Romans 1:14</a>, "wise and foolish," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1Timothy 6:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-3.htm" title="For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.">Titus 3:3</a>, but not the same as that which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-26.htm" title="And every one that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house on the sand:">Matthew 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-17.htm" title="You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?">Matthew 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-40.htm" title="You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?">Luke 11:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-22.htm" title="Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,">Romans 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?">1Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are despised.">1Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For you suffer fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.">2Corinthians 11:19</a>, &c. The combination, "fools and slow of heart," helps to bring out its meaning. "Slow of heart" refers to deadness of the moral affections; "fools" and "foolish" to the absence or undisciplined condition of the reasoning faculty. The Gauls of Galatia were a people intellectually shallow and frivolous. A little reason and reflection would have kept them from so gross an inconsistency.<p><span class= "bld">Bewitched you.</span>--The Greek word for this is probably connected in origin with the Latin word from which is derived our own "fascinate," and the idea prominent in both is that which is embodied in the popular superstition of the evil eye. This superstition lingers still, especially in some southern countries, such as Italy and Spain. In Italy it is well known under the names "jettatura," "occhio cattivo." In Spain its existence has been graphically illustrated by a picture of the late J. Phillip, R.A., now in the museum at Stirling.<p>The metaphor here is strikingly in harmony with that which follows. The cross of Christ has been "evidently set forth" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> posted up in large and bold characters) before the Galatians, but some evil fascination (that of their Judaising teachers) has drawn away their eyes from looking upon it, and held them fixed upon another object (legal observances), as baneful as the cross was salutary.<p><span class= "bld">That ye should not obey the truth.</span>--These words are omitted by the best MSS. and by all recent editors. They were, without doubt, originally a gloss, put in to explain more fully the single word "bewitched." As an explanation they are sufficiently right, but they certainly did not form part of the text as it left the hands of St. Paul.<p><span class= "bld">Evidently set forth.</span>--This hardly brings out the full force of the metaphor, which is that of a picture or writing conspicuously and publicly exhibited.<p><span class= "bld">Crucified.</span>--This word is emphatic: "Jesus Christ, and Him crucified."<p><span class= "bld">Among you.</span>--If these words are to be retained in the text they must, of course, be taken, not with "crucified," but with "evidently set forth." They will then be a repetition, intended to enhance the force of the phrase "before whose eyes"--"before whose eyes and in whose very midst Jesus Christ was set forth crucified." But the probability is that the words ought to be omitted altogether, as they are wanting in the four most ancient MSS., as well as in a majority of the oldest versions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O foolish Galatians</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). In thus apostrophizing them, the apostle brands their present behaviour, not any lack of intelligence on their part in general (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25</a>). "Foolish" - to allow yourselves to be thus robbed of your happiness. The transporting feeling of elevation and joy with which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19-21</a>, the apostle describes himself as crucified with Christ to the Law, and as living in Christ and through Christ, makes him the more keenly sensible of the senseless folly shown by the Galatians in taking up the observance of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truths?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>; [Receptus adds, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>]); <span class="accented">who in his envy did bewitch you</span>? With respect to the Greek text, there is now no doubt amongst editors that the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "that ye should not obey the truth," are not genuine here, being in all probability foisted in from Galatians 5:7. We have, therefore, to omit them and to read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as before <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is a remarkable word, and calls for comment. In common Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>, to treat one with malignant words, means either to slander, belie, blacken character, or to cast upon him primarily words conveying baleful spells, and then, in later usage very frequently, baleful spells of any kind, and more especially spells from the "evil eye" (Aristotle, Plutarch); in the language of old English superstition, "forelook" or "overlook." Indeed, so closely did this last notion cling to the verb, as to have suggested to Greek grammarians for its etymology, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to kill with the eyes." The more scientific etymologists of recent days derive it from <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1ffd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, speak; as if it were "to bespeak a man." The nouns <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, following the senses of the verb, express the ideas, either of envious detraction or of sorcery (see Schneider; Passow; Liddell and Scott). In the New Testament the word occurs only here. In the Septuagint we meet with it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54</a>, where, for the words, "His eye shall be evil towards his brother," we have <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, meaning apparently, "He shall grudge with his eye his brother;" and so again in ver. 56, the same phrase is used analogously of the tender woman, "She shall grudge with her eye her husband;" Ecclus. 14:6, "There is not a worse man (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) than he that grudges his own self;" ibid. ver. 8, "Evil is (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>) he that grudgeth with his eye. In Scripture, both in the Old Testament and the New, and in the Apocrypha, the phrases, "the eye being evil," "the evil eye," following the Hebrew, always denote envy, ill nature, stinginess (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54, 56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a> [comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>, "a bountiful eye"]; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-22.htm">Mark 7:22</a>). Nowhere either in the Scriptures or in the Apocrypha is there any reference to "forelooking," unless perchance the <span class="accented">me'onen</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a> (Authorized Version, "observer of times"), is etymologically connected with the Hebrew word for "eye," which, however, few critics suppose. Ignatius, 'Ad Romans', 3, has <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "never grudged any man." This Septuagintal use of the verb presents, as the reader will observe, a somewhat different shade of meaning to any of those cited above from the lexicons. Following, however, its guidance, we may understand the apostle as here asking, "Whoso ill-natured jealousy was it that did light upon you?" and as intending to convey these two ideas: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the envy of their once happy state which actuated the agent referred to; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by <span class="accented">implication</span>, the baleful effect wrought by the envier upon them. The aorist of the verb seems to point to a decisive result. He had, it is hinted, succeeded in his wish; he had robbed them of the blessedness which had excited his jealousy. In respect to the former idea, elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a>, "They would fain shut you out") the apostle ascribes the action of their misleaders to sinister designs against their well-being. It is, indeed, this thought that inspires the extreme severity of his language above in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>; the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, of whom he here speaks, belonged to, or derived from, <span class="accented">them.</span> In short, the pathetic question here before us breathes the like indignation and vexation as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>, "Ye were running on well: who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?" - the last words of which passage, though not admissible here in the text, would, however, if there, form a perfectly correct explanatory clause. The more distinctly to mark the effect actually produced by the envier, very many commentators have enwoven into their interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, besides its Septuagiutal sense, its other sense of blasting with some kind of charm: "The malignity," Chrysostom writes, "of a demon whose spirit [or, 'breath'] had blasted their prosperous estate." Great use has been made, in particular, by many, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jerome and, according to Estius, by Thomas Aquinas, of the superstition of the "evil eye," which, in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, has in all ages been so rife. Bishop Lightfoot, in his interesting note on the passage, offers the following paraphrase: "Christ's death in vain? O ye senseless Gauls, what bewitchment is this? I placarded Christ crucified before your eyes. Ye suffered them to wander from this gracious proclamation of your King. They rested on the withering eye of the sorcerer. They yielded to the fascination and were riveted there. And the life of your souls has been drained out of you by that envious gaze." It may, however, be questioned whether the apostle would have recognized his own thought in this thorough-going application of the superstition of the "evil eye." It is doubtful whether he used the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> with reference to any species of sorcery at all; but if he did, he may have intended no more than this: "What envious ill-wisher has by some strange, inexplicable sorcery so wrought upon you? Or, how can I explain your behaviour, except that you have been acting under some binding spell? Surely such folly is well-nigh inconceivable with men in free possession of their own souls." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> each of these two renderings of the passage is open to the objection that St. Paul, in writing <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, either might have intended to express by the word "envious grudging," according to its Sep-tuagintal use, or he might have meant some kind of sorcery according to a common acceptation of the term, but could hardly have meant to convey both senses together. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The introduction of the supposition is inconvenient, not only because there could not have really been any such ingredient in the actual circumstances of the present case, but also because its mention would serve to excuse the folly of the Galatians, as indeed Chrysostom observes that it does, rather than to enhance its censure, which latter would have been more to the apostle's purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It seems especially improbable that the apostle was thinking of the "evil eye" when we consider the entire absence of its mention in the sacred writings. <span class="cmt_word">Before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>;); <span class="accented">to whom</span>, <span class="accented">before your very eyes</span>, <span class="accented">Jesus Christ had been</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was</span>) <span class="accented">aforetime</span> (or, <span class="accented">openly</span>) <span class="accented">set forth crucified</span> (<span class="accented">among you</span>)? The genuineness of the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "among you," is very doubtful. The Revised Greek text omits them. The words, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "before your very eyes," are very pointed; for the Greek expression, comp. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>), and Aristoph., 'Ran.,' 625, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x1fc3;</span>, "that he may say it to your very face." The sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span> is much disputed. It is not clear whether the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> is the "before" of time or of place. Of the other passages in the New Testament in which this compound verb occurs, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a> twice, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> is certainly, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a> probably, not so certainly (comp. 1 Macc. 10:36, "enrolled"), "before" of time. In the present passage a reference to the prophecies of the Old Testament seems out of place. It is far more suitable to the connection to suppose that the apostle is referring to his own preaching. Some commentators, retaining the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, connect them with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span> in the sense of "in you," comparing "Christ in you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>), and "written in your hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>); and so render the words thus: "written of, or described, before in you." But such an expression, sufficiently awkward in itself, would further be very unsuitably introduced after the words, "before your very eyes." Supposing we take the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> as of time, there is no satisfactory explanation of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span>, if understood in the sense of <span class="cmt_word"></span> writing, there being no tablet (so to speak) suggested on which the writing could be conceived of as done. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span>, it is true, means "describe" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>; but it is still a description in writing. We are, therefore, driven to assign to the verb the notion of portraying as in a painting, a sense which in Common Greek it certainly does sometimes bear, and which attaches to it in the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a> (Septuagint). We thus gain the sense, "had before been set forth or por trayed;" before (that is) the envier assailed you. This same sense, of portraying rather than of writing, would be also the best to give to the verb, supposing the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> to be understood as the "before" of place; which conception of the preposition Bishop Lightfoot contends for, urging the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the nouns <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, with reference to the placards on which public notices were given of political or other matters of business. When, how ever, we consider how partial the apostle is to verbs compounded with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> of time, as is seen in his use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, not a few of which were probably compounded by himself as he wanted them, it appears highly probable that, to serve the present occasion, he here forms the compound <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> in the sense of "portraying before," the compound not existing elsewhere in the same sense. He compares, then, the idea of Christ crucified, presented to his hearers in his preaching, to a portraiture, in which the Redeemer had been so vividly and with such striking effect exhibited to his converts, that it ought in all reason have for ever safeguarded their souls against all danger from teaching of an alien character. If the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, be retained, it appears best, with Chrysostom and many others, to understand it as meaning, that St. Paul had presented Christ crucified in such lively colours to their view, that they had, <span class="accented">as it were</span>, seen him hanging on the cross in their very midst. The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, disconnected from <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> and at the end of the sen tence, gives it intense significance. What the idea of Christ crucified was to his own self, the apostle had just before declared; for him it at once had destroyed all spiritual connection with the ceremonial Law, the Law which bade the crucified One away from itself as accursed, and also by the infinite love to himself which he beheld manifested in Christ crucified <span class="accented">for him</span>, had bound him to him by spiritual ties both all-constrain ing and iudissoluble. And such (he means) should have been the effect produced by that idea upon <span class="accented">their</span> souls. What envier of their happiness in him could, then, possibly have torn them from him? This same portraiture of "Christ crucified" which he reminds the Galatians he had in those days presented to them, he also, as he tells the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20, 21</a>), had been intent on holding up before the Greeks of Achaia; while, further, he intimates to the Romans, in his Epistle to them, how eager he was to come and at Rome also hold up Christ as him whom God had set forth to be a Propitiation, through faith, by his blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-15.htm">Romans 1:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>). Both to the Jew and to the Gentile, both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to unwise, this, emphatically <span class="accented">this</span>, was the alone and the sovereign salvation. This picturing forth of the crucified One, however, would hardly from Paul's lips concern itself much with the outward particulars of the passion; it might have been this, in a far greater degree, in St. Peter's presentment of it, who had been himself witness of those sufferings; but Paul, with his habits of thought, as we know them from his writings, who knew Christ as in the spirit rather than as in the flesh, would occupy himself more with the spiritual <span class="accented">idea</span> of the cross - its embodiment of perfect meekness and gentleness and self-sacrifice, of humility. of obedience to the Father's will, of love to all mankind, of especial care for his own, and its antagonism to the spirit of Levitical ceremonialism. "Such presentment," remarks Calvin, "as if in a picture, nay, as if actually crucified in the very midst of the hearers themselves, no eloquence, no artifice of rhetoric, can produce, unless that mighty working of the Spirit be assistant of which the apostle speaks in his two Epistles to the Corinthians (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4, 5, 13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3, 6</a>). If any, therefore, would fain duly discharge the ministry of the gospel, let them learn not so much to apply eloquence and declamation, as to likewise so pierce into men's consciences that these may truly <span class="accented">feet</span> Christ crucified and the dropping upon them of his blood. Where the Church hath painters such as these, she very little needeth any more representations in wood and stone, that is, dead images, very little any paintings; and certainly among Christians the doors of the temples were not open for the reception of images and paintings until the shepherds either had grown dumb and become mere dolls, or else did say in the pulpit no more than just a few words, and these in so cold and perfunctory a manner that the power and efficacy of the gospel ministry was utterly extinct." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Several things made the folly of the Galatian Christians worse. They had the doctrine of the cross preached, and the Lord's supper administered among them, in both which Christ crucified, and the nature of his sufferings, had been fully and clearly set forth. Had they been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, by the ministration of the law, or on account of any works done by them in obedience thereto? Was it not by their hearing and embracing the doctrine of faith in Christ alone for justification? Which of these had God owned with tokens of his favour and acceptance? It was not by the first, but the last. And those must be very unwise, who suffer themselves to be turned away from the ministry and doctrine which have been blessed to their spiritual advantage. Alas, that men should turn from the all-important doctrine of Christ crucified, to listen to useless distinctions, mere moral preaching, or wild fancies! The god of this world, by various men and means, has blinded men's eyes, lest they should learn to trust in a crucified Saviour. We may boldly demand where the fruits of the Holy Spirit are most evidently brought forth? whether among those who preach justification by the works of the law, or those who preach the doctrine of faith? Assuredly among the latter.</body></html>
