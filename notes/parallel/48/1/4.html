The phrase has a parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>, and appears in its full and complete form in the Gospel saying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>): "The Son of Man came to give His life a ransom for many "; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a> : "Who gave Himself a ransom" (the word is here a compound, which brings out more strongly the sense of vicariousness) "for all."<p><span class= "bld">For our sins.</span>--In the Greek there are three prepositions, which can only be translated by the single word "for" in English. The first has for its primary sense "concerning," or "relating to"; it merely marks a connection or relation between two facts. The second has rather the sense "in behalf of," "in the interests of." The third means strictly "in place of." The first, as might be expected, is naturally used in respect of <span class= "ital">things;</span> the second and third of <span class= "ital">persons.</span> The death of Christ was a sacrifice <span class= "ital">for sins, i.e.,</span> the sins of mankind stood in a distinct relation to it, which was really that of cause. The sins of mankind it was which set the whole scheme of redemption in motion, and to take away those sins was its main object. The death of Christ was a sacrifice <span class= "ital">for sinners.</span> It was a sacrifice wrought in their behalf, for their benefit. It was also a sacrifice wrought <span class= "ital">in their stead.</span> Christ suffered in order that they might not suffer. He gave His life "a ransom <span class= "ital">for </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., in place of</span>) many." The first of these meanings is represented in Greek by the preposition <span class= "ital">peri,</span> the second by <span class= "ital">huper,</span> the third by <span class= "ital">anti.</span> The distinction, however, is not quite strictly kept up. We not unfrequently find the death of Christ described as a sacrifice for (<span class= "ital">on behalf of</span>) sins. This would correspond rather to our phrase "for the sake of." The object was to do away with sins. They were, as it were, the final cause of the atonement.<p>It is somewhat doubtful which of the first two prepositions is to be read here. By far the majority of MSS. have <span class= "ital">peri,</span> but the famous Codex Vaticanus, and one of the corrections of the Sinaitic MS., have <span class= "ital">huper.</span> The two prepositions are not unfrequently confused in the MSS., and the probability in this case is that the numerical majority is right. It will then be simply stated in the text that the sins of men and the sacrifice of Christ have a relation to each other. If there had been no sin there would have been no redemption.<p><span class= "bld">Deliver us.</span>--The deliverance present to the mind of the Apostle appears to be rather (in technical language) that of sanctification than that of justification. The object of redemption is regarded for the moment as being to deliver men from sin, and not so much to deliver them from guilt, the consequence of sin. The Atonement has really both objects, but it is the first that the Apostle has in view in this passage.<p><span class= "bld">This present evil world.</span>--The reading of the three oldest and best MSS. tends rather to emphasise the word "evil"--"this present world, with all its evils." A question is raised as to the word translated "present," which might probably mean "impending;" but the Authorised version is probably right. "This present world" is strictly <span class= "ital">this present age.</span> The Jews divided the history of the world into two great periods--the times antecedent to the coming of the Messiah, and the period of the Messianic reign. The end of the first and the beginning of the second were to be especially attended with troubles; and it was just in this transition period--the close of the older dispensation of things--in which the Apostles regarded themselves as living. The iniquities of the Pagan society around them would naturally give them an intense longing for release; but the release which they seek is moral and spiritual. They do not so much pray that they may be "taken out of the world" as that they may be "kept from the evil." This the Christian scheme, duly accepted and followed, would do. The Atonement free men from guilt, but its efficacy does not cease there; it sets going a train of motives which hold back the Christian from sin, and constrain him to use his best endeavours after a holy life. The Galatians had lost sight of the power of the Atonement to do this, and had fallen back upon the notion of a legal righteousness, through the vain attempt to keep the commandments of the Law.<p><span class= "bld">According to the will.</span>--The scheme of redemption was willed by God, and therefore all that was done, either on the part of man or of his Redeemer, was a carrying out of His will.<p><span class= "bld">Of God and our Father.</span>--Or, as it might be, <span class= "ital">of our God and Father.</span> It was the fatherly love of God for His creature, man, that set the work of redemption in motion; hence, in reference to the work of redemption, He is spoken of as "<span class= "ital">our</span> Father"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Father of mankind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who gave himself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>). This is the strongest imaginable description of what Christ did to redeem us. The phrase occurs in 1 Macc. 6:44, with reference to the Eleazar who rushed upon certain death to kill the elephant which was carrying the king, Antiochus: "He gave himself (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) to save his people." It is applied to Christ also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>," Who gave himself for us;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>, "Who gave himself a ransom for all." In the next chapter, ver. 20, the apostle writes, "Who loved me, and gave himself up (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) for me." Similarly, St. Paul writes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>, "He that spared not [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'kept not back'] his own Son, but gave him <span class="accented">up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) for us all." The addition, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>, of the words, "into the hands of sinners," and our Lord's utterance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-53.htm">Luke 22:53</a>, "This is your hour, and the power of darkness," help to illustrate the exceedingly pregnant expression now before us. <span class="cmt_word">For our sins</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). This is the reading of the Textus Receptus, retained by the Revisers. On the other hand, L. T. Tr., for <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>, substitute <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>. These two prepositions <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> are, in this relation as well as in some others, used indifferently. If we follow the reading of Rec. L. T. Tr. Rev. (for very often the manuscripts oscillate between the two), we have <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>, "Died for our sins;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>, "To offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the <span class="accented">sins</span> of the people;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>, "Blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the ignorances of the people." On the other hand, we find in the same authorities <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, "Sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-3.htm">Hebrews 5:3</a>, "As for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins" (where, however, the Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> in the last clause, ("for sins"); <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-6.htm">Hebrews 10:6</a>, "Whole burnt offerings, and <span class="accented">sacrifices</span> for sin;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a>, "No more offering for sin;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2, 10</a>, "Propitiation for our sins;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>, "Died [or, 'suffered'] for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>) sins, the righteous for (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>) the unrighteous." The last passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>) suggests the remark that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> is the more appropriate word before persons, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> before "sins." We find, however, that, in the Septuagint, in the Pentateuch <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> is used also before persons as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-3.htm">Hebrews 5:3</a>; thus: <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-18.htm">Leviticus 5:18</a>, "The priest shall make atonement for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> him concerning (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>) his ignorance;" in both cases rendering the Hebrew <span class="accented">al.</span> So <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-20.htm">Leviticus 4:20, 26, 31, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-12.htm">Numbers 8:12</a>. On the other hand, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30</a> we have "I will go up unto the Lord, that I may make atonement for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="accented">b'ad</span>) your sin." The truth seems to be that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>, which is more properly "on behalf of" often denotes "for," equivalent to "on account of;" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>, Septuagint, "rebukes for sin;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>, "Giving thanks always for all things;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>, "Glorify God for his mercy." And this sense passes into "concerning," "with reference to;" as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>, "I would not have you ignorant concerning our affliction;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>, "Whether <span class="accented">any inquire</span> about Titus." On the other hand, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, which more properly denotes "concerning," "with reference to," passes into the sense of "on account of;" as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-37.htm">Luke 19:37</a>, "Praise God for all the mighty works;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>, "I thank my God... concerning you;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>, "We give thanks to God for you all;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>, "I thank my God for [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>] you all." The use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in the verse before us, and in the similar passages above cited, no doubt followed its use in the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which in the LXX. so commonly describes the "sin offering" of the Levitical institute. This phrase sometimes represents what in the Hebrew text is the simple noun (<span class="accented">chattath</span>) "sin," put for "sin offering;" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-37.htm">Leviticus 7:37</a>, "This is the law ofthe burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering (<span class="accented">chattath</span>)," etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.). Sometimes it represents the same Hebrew noun preceded by the preposition <span class="accented">al</span>, for: "For the sin of such or such a one (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>);" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5.htm">Leviticus 5</a>:35, where the LXX. has, "The priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he hath sinned (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>)." The precise force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in this phrase was probably "on account of sin," or "having reference to sin;" senses of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> which, as has been seen, are borne by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> as well. This view of the force of these two prepositions, as employed in this relation, seems to the present writer more satisfactory than that which refers it to the notion of protection, "on behalf of" or "for the good of" some one; though it must unquestionably be allowed that this is a notion which they both of them frequently convey. To this latter notion, indeed, we must in all probability refer the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, "Gave himself up for me," as well as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18, 6</a>, for the unrighteous;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19, 20</a>, "Given for you," "Poured out for you," and the like; and also that of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>, "Shed for many;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> pray for them;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>, "Praying for us." The result of this inquiry into the <span class="accented">usus loquendi</span> with reference to these prepositions appears to be this: in what manner the death of Christ affected our condition in those respects in which that condition was antecedently qualified by our sins, neither <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> nor <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> as prefixed to the noun "sins" enables us precisely to determine, further than as it recalls for illustration the "sin offering" of the Law. For the more complete development of the idea intended to be conveyed, we must look to other references made in Scripture to the subject, such as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>. Thus much, however, we may confidently assume: both <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> as so applied do alike warrant us in concluding, not only that it was because of our sins that Christ behoved to die, but also that his death is efficacious for the complete removal of those evils which accrue to us from our sins. That he might deliver us from this present evil world (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. Such is the reading of L. T. Tr. Rev.; while the Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">that he might deliver us out of the present world</span>, <span class="accented">evil that it is.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, originally "take out," renders the Hebrew <span class="accented">hitztzil</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-8.htm">1 Samuel 4:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a> in the sense of "deliver;" it points to "the present state" as one of helpless misery or danger. Compare the use of the verb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-10.htm">Acts 7:10, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a>; it is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-74.htm">Luke 1:74</a>. The participle "present" or "subsisting," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, is found in explicit contrast with the participle "to come," <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>," Nor things present nor things to come;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>. We are, therefore, naturally led to suppose that the apostle means to contrast the "world" here referred to with a "world to come;" which latter is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-5.htm">Hebrews 6:5</a>, and seems synonymous with the "world [literally, 'inhabited earth'] to come," <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>. Compare our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>, "Neither in this world nor in that which is to come," and his contrast of "this world" with "that world" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-34.htm">Luke 20:34, 35</a>. The Greek word here employed, <span class="accented">aion</span>, like <span class="accented">kosmos</span>, is used with varying shades of meaning. The two nouns, used interchangeably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18, 19</a> are, however, not altogether equivalent. The former originally denotes a mode of time; the latter, a mode of space. In particular, <span class="accented">aion</span> is never used in the Greek Testament to denote "mankind," as <span class="accented">kosmos</span> not unfrequently is by all its writers. In the Syriac Version, <span class="accented">olmo</span> represents both <span class="accented">aion</span> and <span class="accented">kosmos</span> in all their senses, with a slight variation in its form to represent <span class="accented">aion</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, "The course (<span class="accented">aida</span>) of this world (<span class="accented">kosmos</span>)," as if it were "The worldliness of this world." Probably the same word <span class="accented">olmo</span>, in the Chaldean-Hebrew language current amongst the Palestinian Jews, was the term employed by them in all those connections in which either <span class="accented">aion</span> or <span class="accented">kosmos</span> would have been used by them if speaking in Hellenistic Greek; for it is to the Hellenistic dialect of the Greek language that both words as so employed belong. We never find <span class="accented">aion</span> at all in any of St. John's writings, except in the phrases, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, denoting "for ever." In other significations, when other writers of the New Testament might have used <span class="accented">aion</span>, St. John always puts <span class="accented">kosmos.</span> The word <span class="accented">aion</span>, denoting a cycle of time, is used also to signify a material world, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; and, in particular, the state of things found existing in that cycle of time; and this as viewed in various aspects. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-34.htm">Luke 20:34, 35</a> "this <span class="accented">aida"</span> contrasts the present state, as one of mortality and successive reproduction, with "that <span class="accented">aion</span>," viewed as one of immortality, in which processes of reproduction are found no more. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm">Luke 16:8</a> "the children of this <span class="accented">aion"</span> are those who live after the world-loving, sinful fashion which characterizes mankind in general in contrast with "the children of light," who have been enlightened to recognize their relation to a spiritual world. In St. Paul, "the present <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> denotes the entire moral and spiritual state of mankind viewed in the aspect in which he contemplated it - a state wrapped in spiritual "darkness," pervaded by ungodliness and general immorality, and dominated by Satan; as Bengel puts it, "tota oeconomia peceati sub potestate Satanae" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>); a state from which Christians ought to study to get wholly weaned in all their moral and spiritual habits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>). In St. John, the phrases, "the world (<span class="accented">kosmos</span>)," or "this world" are frequently employed to express the same idea; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>. Out of this "power, empire, of darkness," in which by nature apart from Christ's grace all men are hopelessly enthralled; out of the grasp, inextricable by any efforts of their own, with which Satan holds them, - the apostle recognizes Christ as alone able to "rescue" us; and even him only able to "<span class="accented">rescue"</span> us by virtue of his atoning sacrifice of himself Thus, in an eminently just application of the verb, he is said to "redeem" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) them from all iniquity, which expression includes, not only the idea of his paying down a ransom for their emancipation, but also the thought that, by the power of his grace, he makes the ransom effectual for the actual moral and spiritual deliverance, one by one, of those who believe in him: "he purifies them a people of his very own, devoted to good works" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>). The position in the Greek of the epithet "evil," standing in a peculiar manner without the article after "this present world" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), is discussed both by Bishop Ellicott and by Bishop) Lightfoot in their respective Commentaries on the Epistle; the latter of whom takes it as equivalent to "<span class="accented">with</span> all its evils." It seems to the present writer that the syntax of the clause groups it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>," That which is called circumcision, in the flesh, made [or, 'done '] with hands (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>),<span class="accented">"</span> where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> has no article, because it is a logical adjunct: the circumcision "which is made in the flesh with hands," is of course no real circumcision (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a>. fin.), and there-fore is only one so "called." So in the present passage the epithet "evil" is a logical adjunct: the state of the world being an "evil state," craved Christ's redemption, and this fact should make that redemption welcome to us. Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a> the epithet" handed from your fathers (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)," added after "your vain manner of life," is a logical adjunct: the fact that it was ancient and traditional gave it so strong a hold upon them as to crave the intervention of a no ordinary ransom to redeem them from it. With the turn of thought, which according to this view is indicated by the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> having been added to the noun without the article, agrees likewise the emphatic position of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> at the Lead of the sentence. Christ gave his own very self for this end, that he might <span class="accented">deliver</span> us out of this wretched state of things to which we belonged. But the reactionary movement now showing itself among the Galatians would inevitably, the apostle feels (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>), have the effect of making void this redeeming work of Christ, and of involving them afresh in their original misery. If we adhere to the reading in the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, we had best, perhaps, accept Winer's proposal ('Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 20, 1 <span class="accented">a</span>), and explain the absence of the article by supposing <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> as forming one notion, as in the case of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;</span>. in the Textus Receptus of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-3.htm">1 Corinthians 10:3</a>. But this reading, though grammatically it runs more smoothly than the other, is on that very account the less likely to have been the original one, and seems greatly to blunt the significance of the adjective. May we not detect in this epithet "evil" the sound of a sigh, drawn from the apostle's heart by this flesh worry and disappointment now cropping up for him and for all who cared for the success of the gospel? His feeling seems to be - Oh the weary evilness of this present state! When will it be brought to an end by the appearing of that blissful hope? (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the will of God and our Father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">according to the will of our God and Father. It is</span>, perhaps, of no great consequence whether we understand this clause as pointing to the whole preceding sentence, "Who gave himself... world," or to the last clause of it, "That he might deliver... world." But the former is the more probable construction: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> there is no reason for restricting it to the last words; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is in perfect accordance with the apostle's usual reference of Christ's coming into the world and dying for us to the Father's appointment, that he should here too be understood as referring to this work of delivering grace also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The feeling apparently underlies these words of the apostle, that the Judaizing which he has now before his eyes was both setting itself in opposition to the supreme ordering of "our God" - and <span class="accented">his</span> sovereign "will" who of us shall dare to contravene? - and also thwarting the operation of his <span class="accented">fatherly</span> loving-kindness. For the lack of filial confidence in God's love to us, and the slavish ceremonialism which characterized Judaical legalism, were both of them adjuncts of the unspiritual mind still in bondage to "the flesh" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. and 8.), and therefore part and parcel of "this present world." Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-3.htm">Galatians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 8-10</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>," Why, as living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances, Handle not," etc.? As Professor Jowett observes, in this case as well as in the Epistle to the Romans, "The salutation is the proem of the whole Epistle." The expression, "<span class="accented">our</span> God and Father," is pathetic; it is an outcome of the deep complacency with which the apostle cherishes the assurance of God's fatherly love given us in the gospel - a sentiment of complacency stimulated into increased fervency by antagonism to the spiritual mischief confronting him. <span class="accented">Of our God and Father.</span> So Revised Version. This rendering appears decidedly preferable to that given by the Authorized Version, "of God and our Father," though grammatically this latter is confessedly not inadmissible.

Grace, includes God's good-will towards us, and his good work upon us; and peace, all that inward comfort, or outward prosperity, which is really needful for us. They come from God the Father, as the Fountain, through Jesus Christ. But observe, first grace, and then peace; there can be no true peace without grace. Christ gave himself for our sins, to make atonement for us: this the justice of God required, and to this he freely submitted. Here is to be observed the infinite greatness of the price bestowed, and then it will appear plainly, that the power of sin is so great, that it could by no means be put away except the Son of God be given for it. He that considers these things well, understands that sin is a thing the most horrible that can be expressed; which ought to move us, and make us afraid indeed. Especially mark well the words, for our sins. For here our weak nature starts back, and would first be made worthy by her own works. It would bring him that is whole, and not him that has need of a physician. Not only to redeem us from the wrath of God, and the curse of the law; but also to recover us from wicked practices and customs, to which we are naturally enslaved. But it is in vain for those who are not delivered from this present evil world by the sanctification of the Spirit, to expect that they are freed from its condemnation by the blood of Jesus.</body></html>
