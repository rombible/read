From the moment that he became a living and conscious human being he was marked out in the purpose of God for his future mission.<p><span class= "bld">Called me.</span>--The call is identical with the conversion of the Apostle through the vision which appeared to him on the way to Damascus. As the Apostle was conscious of having done nothing to deserve so great a mark of the divine favour, it is set down entirely to an act of grace.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when it pleased God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and when it was the good pleasure of God.</span> The Authorized Version and the Revised Version have "but when." To determine the exact force here of the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, we must consider how the sentence it introduces stands related to what precedes. The main underlying thought of vers. 13, 14 was that the habit of the apostle's mind before his conversion was such as wholly to preclude the notion of his having known the gospel up to that hour. The main thought pervading vers. 15-17, and indeed pursued to the end of the chapter, is that, after he had received from God himself the knowledge of the gospel, he had had no occasion to have recourse to any mortal man, apostle or other, for the purpose of further instruction therein. It follows that the conjunction connecting the two sentences is not <span class="accented">adversative</span>, as it would, of course, be taken if God's dealings with him, described in vers. 15, 16, were the main point of this new paragraph, but is simply the sign of the writer's passing on to <span class="accented">another</span> thought - not one contrasted with the preceding, but merely additional. As examples of the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> as <span class="accented">continuative</span> and not <span class="accented">adversative</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-11.htm">Luke 12:11, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-10.htm">Acts 12:10, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-3.htm">Romans 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15, 17</a>. It may be represented in English by "and" or "and again." In the reading of the Greek text it is not certain whether we ought not to omit the word "God" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). If it is a gloss which has crept into the text, it is unquestionably a just gloss. Similar omissions of the Divine Name, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, are frequent in St. Paul (see ch. 1:6; 2:8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> properly exprcsses complacency; <span class="accented">as e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, "In whom I am well pleased;" and often. And this notion may be commonly traced in its use even when followed, as here, by an infinitive. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, "It would have been a pleasure to us to impart," etc.; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>, "It was painful to us to be left alone, but under the circumstances we gladly chose to be so." When applied, as here, to God, the notion of the pleasure which he takes in acts of beneficence must not be lost sight of; "Was graciously pleased;" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>, "It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a> the noun "good pleasure" points to the act of "predestination" spoken of as (if we may venture so to speak of God) a volition of his heart and not of merely his regulative wisdom. The apostle seems led to use the word here by the complacency and joy which he himself felt in having been made the recipient of this "revelation;" those sentiments of his own bosom are, to his view, a reflection of the Divine complacency in imparting it. At the same time, the reader must be conscious of the deep sense, in fact the supremely prevailing sense, which the apostle has just here, that the imparting of the revelation spoken of was the fruit solely of a Divine volition triumphing over extreme wickedness and infatuation on his own part. Compare, in this respect also, the passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>, just cited. It is this feeling which prompts the introduction of the deeply emotional parenthesis consisting of the two next clauses of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">Who separated me from my mother's womb</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">who set me apart from my mother's womb.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, set apart, separate, which is found used in other relations in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a> (LXX.); <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-49.htm">Matthew 13:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>, is employed here with an implied reference to a specific office or work. Such a reference is explicitly added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>," Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>, "Separated unto the gospel of God." There is this distinction, however, between the "setting apart" of the present passage and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>, that, whereas in the latter it was one actually realized, here it is in the Divine predestination only, which last seems to be nearly the sense of the words, "whereunto I have called them," in the Acts. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a> the verb probably includes both senses. "From my mother's womb" means "from the time that I was as yet unborn;" not perhaps exactly "ever since my birth," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm">Matthew 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8</a>; comp. rather <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>, as illustrated by ver. 41. The addition of these words is designed to mark the purely arbitrary character of this predestination. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11</a>, "The children being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand." Viewed thus, the clause appears as an utterance of adoring humility on the part of the apostle, combined, however, with the strongest possible assertion of the Divine origin of his mission. A similar statement of God's arbitrary selection of a particular human being for a particular function is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>, "The Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name; "ibid., ver. 5, "That formed me from the womb to be his servant;" and again, with yet more striking resemblance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>)." It is difficult not to believe that this conviction of the apostle concerning himself as an object of God's predestinating purpose, and perhaps even the form of its expression - for compare the words in the next verse, "That I might preach him among the Gentiles (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>)" <span class="accented">- was</span> very mainly derived from the Lord's words to Jeremiah, applied by the Spirit to his own particular case (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). The apostle feels that all the while that he had been pursuing that career of persecuting impiety and passionate Pharisaism, the Almighty had kept his eye upon him as his predestined apostle, and been waiting for the fitting hour when to summon him forth to his work. <span class="cmt_word">And called me by his grace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). As the "setting apart" mentioned in the previous clause unquestionably was a "<span class="accented">setting</span> apart" for the apostolic office, it might seen convenient to understand the "calling" likewise as a calling to be an apostle. So most probably we are to take the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a> as meaning "called to be an apostle;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a> the verb "<span class="accented">called"</span> is used of one called to be a priest. But the prevailing sense of "<span class="accented">being</span> called," in St. Paul's writings, refers to the bringing of the soul to Christ and into his kingdom; and in this definite reference the apostle uses the verb no less than twenty-four times, three of them in this Epistle (2 Corinthians 1:6; 5:8, 13). And this, the regular use of the term, is quite in place here. It was quite natural that the writer, after so vividly portraying his former life when unregenerate, should now distinctly advert to the moral transformation which by Divine grace he had been the subject cf. The word "grace" denotes God's freely expanding unmerited goodness, not as existing in himself, but as energizing upon men. This is made clear by the introduction of the preposition (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>) "through" or "by." It is that "grace whose "reigning" power the apostle so exultingly extols in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-21</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5</a>, "By grace have ye been saved"). The notion of mercy shown to the utterly undeserving is a prominent element of the word, connected as it is here with the description of the writer's former wickedness (comp. the use of the verb "obtained mercy (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>)" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13, 16</a>). This clause, together with the preceding one, is not to be taken as a part of the historical statement in conjunction with the next verse, as if tracing the successive steps of the transaction, but as a periphrastic designation of Almighty God adapted to the circumstances of the case. The one article prefixed in the Greek to the two combined clauses shows this. We need not, therefore, perplex ourselves to determine the relation in point of time which the Divine acts here indicated bear to that described in the verse which follows. The tone of the verse is in a measure apologetic, rebutting the prejudice which, we may be sure, did in the view of many accrue to the writer from what he once had been. Thus: "Nevertheless, God had all along, even kern the dawn of his being, set him apart to be his apostle; God, by a marvellous exercise of goodness, had called him forth out of that evil state to be his own: unworthy, no doubt, he had proved himself to be of such mercy; but what God's grace had made him, <span class="accented">that</span> he was; for who should dare to contravene <span class="accented">his</span> hand (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8-10</a>)?" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 St. Paul was wonderfully brought to the knowledge and faith of Christ. All who are savingly converted, are called by the grace of God; their conversion is wrought by his power and grace working in them. It will but little avail us to have Christ revealed to us, if he is not also revealed in us. He instantly prepared to obey, without hesitating as to his worldly interest, credit, ease, or life itself. And what matter of thanksgiving and joy is it to the churches of Christ, when they hear of such instances to the praise of the glory of his grace, whether they have ever seen them or not! They glorify God for his power and mercy in saving such persons, and for all the service to his people and cause that is done, and may be further expected from them.</body></html>
