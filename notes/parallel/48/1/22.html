It means, however, something more than merely "Christian." The various sections of the Christian Church not only professed a common creed, and were called by a common name, but they stood in the same direct and personal relation to Christ as their Head. It was His presence diffused among them which gave them unity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - It is somewhat difficult to determine, and when determined to make evident in translation, the precise flexure in the intonation (so to speak) of these verses. So far as the present writer can see, it is this: the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> in ver. 22 is slightly adversative to the foregoing sentence; as if it were, "During that time the people of Syria and Cilicia saw a great deal of me, but the Churches of Judaea did not see me at all." The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> in ver. 23 introduces a contrast to the foregoing "unknown by face;" as if it were, "They knew me not by face, but only by report." The rendering to be now given will endeavour to represent this view of the whole passage. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And was unknown by face</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>); <span class="accented">but I was all the while unknown by face.</span> The dative <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>, "by face," or "in person," marks (see Winer,' Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 31, 6, a) the sphere to which a wider term is restricted, as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>). Its addition prepares the reader for the subsequent intimation that, though unknown by personal presentment, he was not unknown by repute (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1fb3;</span>). The widened form of the verb, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, intimates the long-continued period, represented by the words "all the while" in our rendering, for which the statement held good; which observation applies also to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 23. The word "still," introduced in the Revised Version, imports, as I humbly venture to think, on idea not actually expressed in the Greek. The apostle states no more than that the Churches of Judaea had at that time no opportunity of coming to know him personally. There is no <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, They had, that is (for this is what seems intended), no opportunity of knowing him in his new character as a disciple of Christ. Whether or not they had known him in the terrible aspect of an unrelenting persecutor, is a matter which for the present lies out of the field of view. The period to which the apostle means this remark of his to apply may be assumed to be the whole time between his conversion and the close of this stay of his in "<span class="accented">Syria</span> and Cilicia." This, as we learn from the Acts, terminated with Barnabas's fetching him to join him in his work at Antioch. After this he did become known to the disciples of Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Churches of Judaea which were in Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). This honorific form of designation, "which were in Christ," breathes a feeling on the part of the apostle of reverential respect for those Churches, as already organized communities vitally united to Christ, while he was as yet only beginning his Christian life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>, "Who were also in Christ before me"). This ceremonious respectfulness is the more in place, inasmuch as the apostle had reason to know that the doctrinal position which he fell himself set to defend, in reference to obedience to the Mosaic Law, was generally distasteful to Jewish believers. Grateful is it, however, to his own feelings to recollect, and now thus publicly to recognize, the kindness and devout thankfulness which in those early days of his Christian career they had evinced with reference to him (see note on ver. 24). At the same time, his entire independence of the whole Jewish community when first beginning to preach is plainly indicated. It was from no Judaean Church any more than from Jerusalem and its apostles and elders that he derived the gospel which he had then and ever since been proclaiming. If we take the bearing of the clause, "which were in Christ," as above proposed, we have no need of (Ecumenius's remark, endorsed by various critics, including Alford and even Bishop Lightfoot, that it was added to distinguish the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of Christians from synagogues of non-Christian Jews. Indeed, the remark is itself open to grave exception. It is true that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the singular number is used of the whole Israelite community antecedently to the Christian dispensation; but it is never found either in the New Testament or in the Septuagint to denote, as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> does, an organized collection of Israelites as such, dwelling in a particular neighbourhood, in the way that it is applied to an organized collection of Christians in a neighbourhood; neither is the noun ever applied to Israelites as such in the plural number. The term <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> would, of course, be taken to mean Christian Churches and no other. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 St. Paul was wonderfully brought to the knowledge and faith of Christ. All who are savingly converted, are called by the grace of God; their conversion is wrought by his power and grace working in them. It will but little avail us to have Christ revealed to us, if he is not also revealed in us. He instantly prepared to obey, without hesitating as to his worldly interest, credit, ease, or life itself. And what matter of thanksgiving and joy is it to the churches of Christ, when they hear of such instances to the praise of the glory of his grace, whether they have ever seen them or not! They glorify God for his power and mercy in saving such persons, and for all the service to his people and cause that is done, and may be further expected from them.</body></html>
