The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> denotes the sphere in which they found occasion for praising God. Instances of a somewhat similar use of the preposition are <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: ver. 6, <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: 9:15, <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. The sentence is not essential to the line of thought in vers. 21-23. The apostle was probably prompted to add it by the complacency which he felt in the interest and sympathy which in those days the Jewish Churches showed towards him - sentiments which afterwards faded too much away into those of suspicion and alienation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>). He rejoices to remember, and he will have the Galatian Churchmen know, that once the believers of the circumcision were proud of him, and were satisfied that he was preaching the true gospel of Christ. And his preaching was the same now as it had been then. <span class="ref_word">ADDITIONAL NOTES.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 St. Paul was wonderfully brought to the knowledge and faith of Christ. All who are savingly converted, are called by the grace of God; their conversion is wrought by his power and grace working in them. It will but little avail us to have Christ revealed to us, if he is not also revealed in us. He instantly prepared to obey, without hesitating as to his worldly interest, credit, ease, or life itself. And what matter of thanksgiving and joy is it to the churches of Christ, when they hear of such instances to the praise of the glory of his grace, whether they have ever seen them or not! They glorify God for his power and mercy in saving such persons, and for all the service to his people and cause that is done, and may be further expected from them.</body></html>
