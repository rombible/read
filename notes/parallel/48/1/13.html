This "for" introduces the whole statement which follows down to the end of the chapter; for the entire section is written with the view of substantiating the assertion in ver. 12, that he had not received the gospel which he preached from man, but solely through illumination imparted immediately from heaven. "Ye have heard," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> have been told; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-1.htm">Acts 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>, and often. "I am only stating what ye have already been apprised of, when I tell you of," etc. That the aorist tense of the Greek word does not limit the expression to any one communication, such <span class="accented">e.g. as</span> one made by the apostle himself, is shown by the use of this very aorist in blurt, 5:21, 33, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-23.htm">Luke 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-21.htm">Ephesians 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>. The apostle appears to have been himself in the habit of frequently telling the wondrous story of what he once had been and of the change wrought upon him. We have instances of his doing this in fill detail in his speech from the stairs, and in his defence before Agrippa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26.htm">Acts 26</a>.), and with less fulness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8, 9</a>. It is therefore quite supposable that he had himself said as much also in Galatia. We observe, however, that the apostle does not say, "heard from me," as he might have done if he had himself been their informant: and, further, that the effect of the words, "ye have heard," does not, in point of construction at least, of necessity extend beyond the fourteenth verse. We are therefore at liberty to surmise that what he here refers to as having been told them relates simply to his life before his conversion; and that the accounts which they had received of it bad come through unfriendly informants. These may have been either unbelieving Jews or Judaizing Christians, who wished by these statements to disparage the apostle's character as one who, if he really was not dishonest, was at all events capable of passing from one extreme of sentiments to their direct opposite with the utmost suddenness and levity, and therefore was not a man entitled to be regarded with confidence. <span class="cmt_word">Of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">of my manner of life formerly in Judaism.</span> "The manner in which I once behaved myself as devoted to Judaism." The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> belongs to the action denoted in the verbal noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, cited by Meyer from Plato ('Legg.,' 3:685, D). <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">conversatio</span>, which occurs repeatedly in the New Testament, is generally rendered "conversation" in Authorized Version (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>). "Judaism" means "the religious life of a Jew," which distinctively was Mosaism. It occurs in 2 Macc. 2:21 2Macc. 14:38; 4 Macc. 4:16. Ignatius ('Ad Magn.,' 8) speaks of "not living according to Judaism," as in ibid., 10, he uses the word "Christianism." St. Paul has the verb "Judaize" below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>. On the objective accusative <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> as defined by the following clause, "how that," etc., see note on <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 11. <span class="cmt_word">How that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">how that beyond measure I was persecuting the Church of God.</span> The imperfect "was persecuting," as well as the following, "was making havoc and was advancing," points to what he was doing when God interposed in the manner described in vers. 15, 16. Compare the use of the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>, Where no such simultaneity required to be indicated. "Beyond measure" or "superlatively" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;</span>' <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) was, at least about this time, a favorite phrase with St. Paul. <span class="accented">A less</span> eager pen might have written "exceedingly" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>. "Of God." This is added to "<span class="accented">the</span> Chinch" with pathos of strong self-condemnation, as it is also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>. The apostle feels now that his violence against the Church was a kind of sacrilege. The sentiment is an echo of Christ's words to him," Why persecutest thou me?" <span class="cmt_word">And wasted it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">and making havoc of it.</span> The Greek verb (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) used again in this relation below, ver. 23, is similarly employed also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-21.htm">Acts 9:21</a>, "made havoc of those who called upon this Name." The verb properly denotes "devastate," "harry;" and in classical Greek is used with reference to towns, countries, and the like, being applied to persons only in the poetical style (Liddell and Scott). In the New Testament it is used only in relation to Soul's persecution, apparently marking its deadly effectiveness as well as Saul's determination if possible to <span class="accented">extirpate</span> the faith and its adherents. The <span class="accented">expugnabam</span> of the Vulgate would seem a fair equivalent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-14 In preaching the gospel, the apostle sought to bring persons to the obedience, not of men, but of God. But Paul would not attempt to alter the doctrine of Christ, either to gain their favour, or to avoid their fury. In so important a matter we must not fear the frowns of men, nor seek their favour, by using words of men's wisdom. Concerning the manner wherein he received the gospel, he had it by revelation from Heaven. He was not led to Christianity, as many are, merely by education.</body></html>
