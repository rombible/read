He does this by means of an historical retrospect of his career, proving by an exhaustive process the thesis with which he starts that the doctrine taught by him comes from a divine source, and possesses the divine sanction.

On the one hand, the fact that the gospel which the apostle had delivered to the Galatians came to him by a direct revelation from Christ, would be properly viewed as a reason for regarding it as sacred and inviolable. Viewed thus, the reading, "now I make known to you," appears justified as introducing a plea warranting the anathema of vers. 8, 9. On the other hand, there is a difference of tone perceptible between the previous context, which is strongly marked, as we have seen, by intense excitement of feeling, and the passage which commences with this verse. The relaxation in the latter of the stern, indignant severity of the former is indicated <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the phrase, "I make known unto you," which, as well as the equivalent phrase, "I would not have you ignorant (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>)," is with the apostle a customary prelude to a context of deliberate and measured statement; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the introduction of the word "brethren," even though, perhaps, holding the position in the sentence which it does here, this compellation has not the same pathetic affectionateness as marks it when heading a sentence; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the strain of quiet narration which the apostle now enters upon. This change in the tone is somewhat adverse to the supposition that the two passages were, as originally written, linked together by the closely connective "for." It suggests to the careful reader the feeling that, after the apostle had somewhat relieved his spirit of the indignant excitement with which he at first addressed himself to the writing of the letter, he laid down his pen at the end of the tenth verse, which had introduced a topic of thought that threatened to lead him aside from his present business; and, after pausing to re fleet how he had best proceed, resumed his work with the purpose of calmly showing, from the very circumstances of his personal history, that the gospel which the Galatians had received from him had solely a Divine origin. This view of the passage likewise favours the reading, "Now I make known to you." For the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> has here that simply <span class="accented">metabatic</span> or transitionary sense which it often bears when the writer is passing on to a fresh section of discourse. Thus, in par-titular, the conjunction is found with "I make known (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>)," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-7.htm">1 Corinthians 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1</a>; and with "I would not have you ignorant," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>. In fact, the direct purpose of the succeeding exposition would seem to be, not precisely so much to make good the particular point that the gospel which the apostle taught was sacred and inviolable, as to show that it was certainly true, and on that ground not to be departed from. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> cannot mean "draw attention to" or "<span class="accented">remind</span> you." Its only sense is "make known." Its employment here appears to indicate a feeling on the apostle's part that the point referred to had, perhaps, not as yet been made definitely clear to those, or at least to some of those, whom he was addressing. <span class="cmt_word">That the gospel which was preached of me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">touching the gospel which was preached by me</span>, <span class="accented">that it.</span> In the Greek, the noun "the gospel" is the accusative governed by "make known;" while in fact the <span class="accented">object</span> contemplated by the verb is, not the gospel itself in general, but certain circumstances relating to it expressed and implied in the following clause: "that it is not after man's fashion." This kind of construction is of frequent occurrence in Greek authors. Analogous examples are found in ver. 13 of this chapter, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-20.htm">1 Corinthians 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>. The aorist tense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> points to the same time as was referred to in "called you" (ver. 6) and "we preached" (ver. 8), which are both in the same tense. <span class="cmt_word">Is</span> <span class="cmt_word">not after man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">is not after the fashion of man</span>; that is, "is not to be estimated as a merely human thing." The clause does not immediately describe the origin of the gospel, which point is distinctly brought out in the next sentence; but rather the character which attaches to it <span class="accented">in consequence</span> of its origin. The sense of the phrase, "according to man," is illustrated by its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-8.htm">1 Corinthians 9:8</a>," Do I speak these things after the manner of men (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "accord-lug to merely human principles of action." <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>, "Walk after the manner of men." On the other band, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>, "godly sorrow," literally, "the grief which is according to God," is a grief such as God inspires and approves; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>, "The new man, which after God [literally, 'according to God'] hath been created," is "created in conformity with God's model or approval" The present tense "is" marks the permanent character attaching to Paul's gospel; it was "the faith once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>) delivered to the saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-14 In preaching the gospel, the apostle sought to bring persons to the obedience, not of men, but of God. But Paul would not attempt to alter the doctrine of Christ, either to gain their favour, or to avoid their fury. In so important a matter we must not fear the frowns of men, nor seek their favour, by using words of men's wisdom. Concerning the manner wherein he received the gospel, he had it by revelation from Heaven. He was not led to Christianity, as many are, merely by education.</body></html>
