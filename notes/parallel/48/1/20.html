The particular things meant are those which are affirmed in vers. 15-19 and to the end of the chapter; points which the Galatians would hardly have become apprised of except upon the apostle's own testimony. What preceded in vers. 13, 14 they <span class="accented">had</span> become acquainted with before, on the testimony of others ("Ye have heard," ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">Behold, before God, I lie not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">behold</span>, <span class="accented">before God</span>, <span class="accented">verily I lie not.</span> The use here of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which in "verily" is paraphrased rather than translated, in this as well as in several other passages of solemn asseveration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-18.htm">2 Corinthians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-10.htm">2 Corinthians 11:10</a>; possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-2.htm">Romans 9:2</a>), savours strongly of Hebraism, being very probably identical with its use for <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, the Hebrew "that," in the Septuagint, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>. So in St. Paul's inexact citation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>. On this use of the Hebrew conjunction, see Gesenius, 'Thes.,' p. 678, B, 1, n, who observes that in such cases there is an evident ellipsis of some such verb as "I protest," "I swear." The apostle was frequently led by the gainsaying of adversaries vitally affecting his official or personal character, to have recourse to forms of the most solemn asseveration. In addition to the passages cited above, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>. If, as Alford in effect observes, a report had been spread among the Galatians that, after his conversion, he had spent years at Jerusalem, receiving instruction in the faith at the hands of the apostles, the facts which he has now stated would have seemed to his readers so astoundingly in contradiction to the impression which they had received, as to require a strong confirmatory asseveration." In the present case," as Professor Jowett remarks, "it is a matter of life and death to the apostle to prove his independence of the twelve." And his independence of them is strongly evinced by the fact that, for several years of his Christian life, during all which he was preaching the same gospel as he now preached, he had not even seen any of them except Peter and James the Lord's brother (if James could be reckoned as an apostle), and these only during a short visit of a fortnight at Jerusalem some three years after his conversion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 St. Paul was wonderfully brought to the knowledge and faith of Christ. All who are savingly converted, are called by the grace of God; their conversion is wrought by his power and grace working in them. It will but little avail us to have Christ revealed to us, if he is not also revealed in us. He instantly prepared to obey, without hesitating as to his worldly interest, credit, ease, or life itself. And what matter of thanksgiving and joy is it to the churches of Christ, when they hear of such instances to the praise of the glory of his grace, whether they have ever seen them or not! They glorify God for his power and mercy in saving such persons, and for all the service to his people and cause that is done, and may be further expected from them.</body></html>
