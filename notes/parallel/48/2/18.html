The thought is not to be tolerated. For, on the contrary, the sin is seen, not in leaving the Law for Christ, but in going back from Christ to the Law. The sin is seen doubly: for on one theory--the theory that the Law is valid--it was wrong to give it up; while on the other theory, that Christianity has taken its place, it is still more wrong to restore the fabric that has once been broken down.<p><span class= "bld">For.</span>--The connection is with the words immediately preceding: "God forbid that Christ should be the minister of sin." The idea is absurd as well as profane. <span class= "ital">For,</span> instead of the Pauline Christian (who follows Christianity to its logical results) being the sinner, it is really the Judaising Christian who stands self-condemned--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in returning to what he has forsaken.<p><span class= "bld">If I build again.</span>--The first person is used out of delicate consideration for his opponents. The Apostle is going to put a supposed case, which really represents what they were doing; but in order to soften the directness of the reference he takes it, as it were, upon himself.<p>St. Paul is fond of metaphors taken from building. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm" title="Yes, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation:">Romans 15:20</a> (building upon another man's foundation), <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10-14</a> (Christ the foundation), <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20-22</a> (the Church built on the foundation of Apostles and prophets), and the words "edify" and "edification" wherever they occur. The idea of "pulling down" or "destroying" is also frequently met with. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-20.htm" title="For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.">Romans 14:20</a> ("for meat destroy not the work of God," the same word as here used, in opposition to "edify," immediately before); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2Corinthians 5:1</a> ("if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved"--pulled down or destroyed); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)">2Corinthians 10:4</a> ("mighty to the pulling down of strongholds")--a different word in the Greek, but similar in meaning.<p>We may compare with the whole verse the well-known saying, "Burn what you have adored, and adore what you have burned."<p><span class= "bld">The things which I destroyed</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Mosaic law, the binding obligation of which had been done away in Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Make myself.</span>--<span class= "ital">Show,</span> or <span class= "ital">prove myself to be:</span> the same word as that translated "commend" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)">Romans 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-8.htm" title="But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.">Romans 5:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">A transgressor.</span>--Hitherto the Apostle had kept up a sort of studied ambiguity in his use of the words "sin," "sinner." The Jews called the Gentiles "sinners," simply from the fact of their being Gentiles. The Pauline Christian placed himself on the same footing with the Gentiles, so far as the Law was concerned, and therefore he, too, in the same phraseology, was a sinner. But now the Apostle uses a word that could not be mistaken. A sinner the Christian might be, in the Judaising sense of the word, but the Judaiser himself was the real sinner: it was he who offended against the immutable principles of right and wrong.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if I build again the things which I destroyed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;</span>); <span class="accented">for if I am building up again the things which I pulled down. <span class="cmt_word"></span>I make myself a transgressor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> [or, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> another form of the same verb]); <span class="accented">a transgressor is what I am showing my own self to be.</span> I must be wrong one way or the other; if I am right now, was wrong then; and from the very nature of the case now in hand, wrong exceedingly; no less than an absolute transgressor. This word "transgressor" denotes, not one who merely happens to break, perchance inadverdently, some precept of the Law, but one who, perhaps in consequence of even one act of wilful transgression, is to be regarded as trampling upon the authority of the Law altogether (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-9.htm">James 2:9, 11</a>, which are the only places of the New Testament in which the word occurs; it is therefore a full equivalent to the word "sinner" of ver. 17). The Greek verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, "to put forward in a clear light," is used similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>. It is much debated, and is certainly nowise clear, how far down in the chapter the rebuke addressed to St. Peter extends. If it does not reach to the end of the chapter, as some think it does, the break may be very well placed at the end of this verse. For this verse clearly relates to St. Peter, whether actually addressed to him or not; notwithstanding that the verbs are in the hypothetical first person singular, they cannot be taken as referred to St. Paul, not being at all applicable to his case. On the other hand, with the nineteenth verse the first person is plainly used by St. Paul with reference to his own self, which is indeed marked by the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> with which it opens. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-19 Paul, having thus shown he was not inferior to any apostle, not to Peter himself, speaks of the great foundation doctrine of the gospel. For what did we believe in Christ? Was it not that we might be justified by the faith of Christ? If so, is it not foolish to go back to the law, and to expect to be justified by the merit of moral works, or sacrifices, or ceremonies? The occasion of this declaration doubtless arose from the ceremonial law; but the argument is quite as strong against all dependence upon the works of the moral law, as respects justification. To give the greater weight to this, it is added, But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ the minister of sin? This would be very dishonourable to Christ, and also very hurtful to them. By considering the law itself, he saw that justification was not to be expected by the works of it, and that there was now no further need of the sacrifices and cleansings of it, since they were done away in Christ, by his offering up himself a sacrifice for us. He did not hope or fear any thing from it; any more than a dead man from enemies. But the effect was not a careless, lawless life. It was necessary, that he might live to God, and be devoted to him through the motives and grace of the gospel. It is no new prejudice, though a most unjust one, that the doctrine of justification by faith alone, tends to encourage people in sin. Not so, for to take occasion from free grace, or the doctrine of it, to live in sin, is to try to make Christ the minister of sin, at any thought of which all Christian hearts would shudder.</body></html>
