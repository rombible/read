The three named in the next verse are to be conceived of as acting as they did in order to give expression to this newly awakened feeling of the general body, and not merely to their own individual judgment. <span class="cmt_word">That the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">that I had been put in trust of the gospel</span>... <span class="accented">as Peter of that of</span>, etc. The perfect present <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, viewed from the time of their seeing it. So the present <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 14, and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40</a>. The perfect is used and not the aorist (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>), as marking the then still continuing holding of the trust, and also perhaps, as implying the con-tinning identity of the doctrine preached. (For the construction of the accusative <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11</a>.) <span class="accented">Gospel of the uncircumcision.</span> The word "gospel" <span class="accented">is</span> frequently used by St. Paul to denote, not so much the substance of its doctrine as the business of proclaiming it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-14.htm">1 Corinthians 9:14, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>); and thus <span class="accented">the gospel of the uncircumcision</span> does not indicate any diversity in the doctrine communicated to the uncircumcision from that communicatcd to the Jews, but simply a diversity in the sphere of its proclamation. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> denotes the class of the uncircumcised in contrast to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, that of the circumcised, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-30.htm">Romans 3:30</a>. <span class="accented">As Peter of that of the circumcision.</span> This distinction between the spheres of work entrusted severally to the two apostles held good of them only as viewed in the main in either case; for as St. Peter was, in fact, the first who opened the gospel to the Gentiles, and afterwards, towards the close of his work, cared for the welfare of Gentile Christians by writing his two Epistles to them, so also St. Paul everywhere in his ministerial work addressed himself in the first instance to the Jews. Nevertheless, in the main, Peter was the head of the Church of the circumcised, Paul of that of the uncircumcised. But how completely the substance of Peter's doctrine was one with that of Paul's is strikingly evinced by his two Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). It is difficult to feel that St. Paul could have written as he here does, if he was aware that St. Peter had been constituted by the Lord Jesus to be his own vicar upon earth, supreme over the whole Church and all its ministers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of the doctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved to preach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.</body></html>
