The verb occurs nowhere else except in later writers, who, it is thought, borrowed it from this passage. Etymologically, according to the ambiguous meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> - "straight," either vertically or horizontally - it may be either "walk up- rightly," that is, "sincerely," which, however, is an unusual application of the notion of <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>; or, "walk straight onward," that is, "rightly." As the apostle is more concerned on behalf of the truth which he was contending for than on behalf of their sincerity or consistency, the latter seems the preferable view. Compare the force of the same adjective in <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, etc<span class="cmt_word">.

This distinctive shade of meaning is not always discernible. <span class="cmt_word">Livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">livest as do the Gentiles and not as the Jews.</span> In what sense, and to what extent, were these words true of St. Peter? When, in the vision at Joppa, unclean animals together with clean were offered to him for food, he had answered, "Not so, Lord; for! have never eaten anything that is common and unclean." This shows that, up to that time, the personal teachings of Christ when he was upon earth had not relieved his mind of the sense that to use certain kinds of meat was for him an unlawful thing. The heavenly rejoinder, "What God hath cleansed, make not thou common," appears to have been understood by him with reference, at least in the first instance, to human beings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>). There seems to be no doubt that the habit of mind generated by long subjection to the Levitical Law. producing repugnance to Gentiles as habitually using unclean meats, he brought with him when crossing Cornelius's threshold; and that it is quite supposable that, in "eating with Gentiles" while his visit to Cornelius continued, he had had no occasion to break through those barriers of restriction which the Law of itself imposed. But, on the other hand, it is also quite supposable that the answer made to him in the vision had, if not at once, at least later, led him on to the further conviction that God had now made all kinds of meat lawful for a Christian's use, although, when consorting, as in the main he had to do, with Jews, he would still bow to the Levitical restrictions. The Petrine Gospel of St. Mark appears, according to the now by many accepted reading of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the text of Mark 7:19, to have stated that Christ in teaching, "Whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him," had said this, "making all meats clean." There is no question that in St. Paul's own view at that epoch of his ministry when he wrote this Epistle, "nothing," to use his own words, "is unclean of itself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23, 25</a>); and we have no reason to doubt that he had "been in the Lord Jesus persuaded" of this long before, - at the very outset probably of his ministry. It is, therefore, not unlikely that this same persuasion of the real indifferency of all kinds of meat had been by Christ instilled into St. Peter's mind as well. But if it were thus in respect to the use of meats, it would be thus also in reference to all other kinds of purely ceremonial restriction. Very shortly before these occurrences at Antioch, St. Peter had at Jerusalem openly and strongly expressed the feeling which he experienced, how intolerably galling were the restraints imposed by the Levitical, not to say by the rabbinical, ceremonialism; "a yoke," he said, "which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear " - language which seems to betoken a mind which had spiritually been set at liberty from the yoke. On the whole, the inference naturally suggested by St. Paul's words, "Thou livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews," commends itself as the true one; namely this - that St. Peter, not on that occasion only, but also on others, when thrown into contact with masses of Gentile converts, was wont to assert his Christian liberty; that, like as St. Paul did, so did he: while, on the one hand, to the Jews he became as a Jew, to them under the Law as under the Law, that he might gain the Jews, gain them that were under the Law, so also, on the other, to them that were without Law he became as without Law, that he might gain also them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x27;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>;). In place of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>, why, recent editions read, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, how, which is a more emphatic interrogatory with a tinge of wonderment; as if it were, "How is it possible that?' (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>). The verb "Judaize" occurs in the Septuagint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>, "And many of the Gentiles had themselves circumcised and Judaized (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) by reason of their fear of the Jews." It is plainly equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;</span>. Compellest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> settest thyself to compel. The "compulsion" applied by Cephas was a moral compulsion; he was, in effect, withholding front them Christian fellowship, unless they Judaized. Put into words, his conduct said this: "If you will Judaize, I will hold fellowship with you; if you will not, you are not qualified for full fraternal recognition from me." The withholding of Christian fraternization, short of formal Church excommunication such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3-5</a>, is a powerful engine of Christian influence, the use of which is distinctly authorized and even commanded in Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10</a> 2John 10), and may on occasion be employed by private Christians on their own responsibility. But its use, when not clearly justified, is not only a cruelty to our brethren, but an outrage upon what St. Paul here calls the truth of the gospel. It is at our peril that we grieve, by a cold or unbrotherly bearing towards him, one whom we have reason to believe God has "received" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>). If God in Christ owns and loves him as a son, we ought to frankly own and love him as a brother. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:11-14 Notwithstanding Peter's character, yet, when Paul saw him acting so as to hurt the truth of the gospel and the peace of the church, he was not afraid to reprove him. When he saw that Peter and the others did not live up to that principle which the gospel taught, and which they professed, namely, That by the death of Christ the partition wall between Jew and Gentile was taken down, and the observance of the law of Moses was no longer in force; as Peter's offence was public, he publicly reproved him. There is a very great difference between the prudence of St. Paul, who bore with, and used for a time, the ceremonies of the law as not sinful, and the timid conduct of St. Peter, who, by withdrawing from the Gentiles, led others to think that these ceremonies were necessary.</body></html>
