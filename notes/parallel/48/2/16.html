This condition could not be produced by works done in obedience to the Law.<p><span class= "bld">But.</span>--The sense of the Greek is not clearly brought out by the Authorised version. A more strict translation would be <span class= "ital">except,</span> which is made to refer only to the word "justified," and not to the previous negation of works, as the cause of justification. "A man is not justified by works (nor is he justified at all), <span class= "ital">except</span> by faith in Christ."<p><span class= "bld">By the faith of Jesus Christ.</span>--The preposition "by" occurs five times in this verse. In every case except the present it is represented by the same word in Greek. There is, however, no substantial difference of meaning; the only difference is that in the other cases stress is laid rather upon the <span class= "ital">cause,</span> here rather upon the <span class= "ital">means.</span> "Faith <span class= "ital">of</span> Jesus Christ" means, as we are more accustomed to say, "faith <span class= "ital">in</span> Jesus Christ."<p><span class= "bld">Even we.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">we too.</span> Jews as we are, in spite of all our privileges.<p><span class= "bld">Have believed.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">believed.</span> This was the great motive of our conversion. We found that the Law could not justify us and that Christ could.<p><span class= "bld">By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</span>--This is a quotation for which no exact equivalent is to be found in the Old Testament. The nearest appears to be <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-2.htm" title="And enter not into judgment with your servant: for in your sight shall no man living be justified.">Psalm 143:2</a> : "In thy sight shall no man living be justified." This, as written under the dispensation of the Law, naturally applied to that dispensation, so that the Apostle was justified in adding "by the works of the Law." The same quotation, in the same words, is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>.<p>The inability of the Law to justify comes out in two ways. (1) The only way in which the Law could justify was through a complete obedience to its provisions. But it was impossible to render a <span class= "ital">complete</span> obedience to it: and to offend in one point was "to be guilty of all;" so that practically, as a matter of fact, no one was justified by it. (2) Nor did it <span class= "ital">help</span> men to justify themselves. It was something dead and lifeless--a mere written letter, possessing none of those "means of grace" which are offered by Christianity. Christ Himself, through faith in Him, is the great means.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>: see note on ver. 15); <span class="accented">yet knowing. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That a man is not justified by the works of the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); or, <span class="accented">by works of Law</span>; or, <span class="accented">by works of the Law.</span> That is, works prescribed by the Law of Moses.

The sentence, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, if regard be had to the exact sense of the proposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, may be supposed to mean "does not <span class="accented">derive</span> righteousness <span class="accented">from</span> works of the Law;" does not get to be justly regarded as holy, pure from guilt approvable, <span class="accented">in consequence of</span> any things done in obedience to God's positive Law. The precise meaning and bearing of the aphorism will appear presently. <span class="cmt_word">But by the faith of Jesus Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">but only through faith of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, properly means "except," "save;" but St. Paul would have betrayed his own position if he had allowed that "works of the Law" could ever have any <span class="accented">part whatever</span> in procuring justification. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> must, therefore, be understood here in that <span class="accented">partially exceptive</span> sense remarked upon in the note on Galatians 1:7 as frequently attaching to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, that is, it means "but only." The apostle plainly intends to make the categorical affirmation that no man gains justification save through faith in Christ; <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. The variation of the proposition, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> in this clause for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> in the preceding clause, we find again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>, "Not having a righteousness which is mine own, that which is (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) of the Law [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> derived from the Law], but that which is (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) through faith of Christ." That no real difference is here intended in the sense is shown by the use immediately after of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> in the clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. For the apostle's present argument it is immaterial whether we are said to gain righteousness <span class="accented">through</span> faith or <span class="accented">from</span> it. As Bishop Lightfoot, however, observes, "Faith is, strictly speaking, only the means, not the <span class="accented">source</span> of justification. The one proposition (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>) excludes this latter notion, while the other (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) might imply it.

Compare the careful language in the Latin of our Article XI., <span class="accented">per</span> fidem, non <span class="accented">propter</span> opera.'" The genitive <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> is paralleled by <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>, and by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>. Possibly the genitive was preferred here to saying <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, as verbally presenting the sharper antithesis to <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Even we</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); just as any sinful outcast of a Gentile would have to do. <span class="cmt_word">Have believed in Jesus Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">did in Christ Jesus believe.</span> The aorist of the verb points to the time of first making Christ the object of trust. The changed order, in which our Lord's <span class="accented">proper</span> name and his official designation appear in this clause compared with the preceding, and which, somewhat strangely, is ignored in our Authorized Version, does not seem to have any real significance; such variation frequently occurs in St. Paul, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1, 2</a>. In the present instance it may have been dictated by the reversal of the order of the ideas, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That we might be justified by the faith of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). Renouncing all thought of gaining righteous<span class="accented">ness</span> by (or from) doing works of the Law, we fixed our faith upon Christ, in order to gain righteousness by (or from) believing in him. The form of expression does not determine the time when they expected to become righteous; but the whole complexion of the argument points to their justification following immediately upon their believing in Christ. That full recognition of fellow-believers, which is the hinge on which the discussion turns, presupposes their being already righteous through their faith. <span class="cmt_word">And not by the works of the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This is added <span class="accented">ex abundanti</span>, to clench more strongly the affirmation that works of the Law have no effect in making men righteous. <span class="cmt_word">For by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> [or rather, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>). This simply repeats the affirmation in the first clause of the verse, with only an intensified positiveness; the future tense, "shall be justified," expressing, not the time at which the act of justification takes place, but the absoluteness of the rule that no human being is to expect ever to be justified by works of the Law. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> we have identically the same sentence with the addition of "in his sight." Instead, however, of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, found in that passage, many recent editors here give <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, there being no more difference between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, than between "because that" and "because." In both passages it looks as if the apostle meant to be understood as citing <span class="accented">a locus probativus</span>; and the addition of the words, "in his sight," in Romans indicates that the authoritative passage referred to is <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>, which in the Septuagint reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, added in both, is a comment of the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> own, founded as it should seem upon the case of the people of Israel, whom the psalmist manifestly included in his universal statement; those who had the Law yet lacked justification before God, every one; those even of them who more or less were doing its works. This verse, viewed as a statement of the individual experience of the two apostles Peter and Paul themselves, is verified with respect to the latter by the accounts given in the Acts of his conversion. With respect to St. Peter, its verification is supplied to the reflective student of the Gospels by his realizing the process of feeling through which that apostle's mind passed in the several situations thus indicated: "This day thou shalt deny me thrice;" "He went out and wept bitterly;" "Go and tell his disciples and Peter, he goeth before you into Galilee;" "The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon;" "Simon, son of John, lovest thou me?" "They worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy." Further, the highly animated language with which, in their writings, each of these apostles - St. Paul, for instance, in the Romans (5. and 8.) and Ephesians, and St. Peter in several passages of his First Epistle - portrays the peace and exulting joy which Christ's disciples experience through faith in him, is evidently drawn from their own mental history. And this happy experience of theirs was, most palpably, in no degree whatever derived from works of the Law, but solely from the grace of Christ As St. Peter had recently intimated at Jerusalem, their hearts, as truly as the hearts of their fellow-believers of the Gentiles, "God had cleansed" from the sense of guilt and pollutedness before him "by faith" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-9.htm">Acts 15:9</a>). It is necessary here to be quite clear as to the nature of those "works of the Law" which the apostle has now in his view. This is determined by the preceding context. The works of the Law now in question were those, the observance of which characterized a man's "living as do the Jews" and their non-observance a man's "living as do the Gentiles." It was the disregard of these works on the part of the Gentile believers which the Jewish Christians, whom St. Peter would fain stand well with, considered as disqualifying them from free association with themselves. So, again, when St. Peter was "living as do the Gentiles," he was viewed as setting at nought, not the moral precepts of the Law, but its positive ceremonial precepts only. It is the making that distinction between believers living as do the Gentiles and believers living as do the Jews, which Peter and the brethren from James were in effect making, that the apostle here sets himself so sternly to reprobate. It is with this view that he here asserts the principle that through faith in Christ a man is made righteous, and that through faith in Christ only can he be, these works having nothing whatever to do with it. "You Cephas," he says, "and I were living as do the Jews; no unclean sinners of Gentiles were we! And both you and I have been made righteous. And how? Not through those works of the Law, but through believing in Christ Jesus. And these Gentile brethren, from whom you are now shrinking back as if they were not good enough for us to associate with, - they believe in Christ as truly as we do; they are therefore as truly righteous as we are. It is absurd for you to try to thrust upon them those works of the Law; by the works of the Law can neither they be made righteous nor yet we. So neither, on the other hand, by disregarding the works of the Law can either they or we be made sinners." This last position, that the neglect of the works of the Law does not disqualify a fellow-Christian for brotherly recognition, is plainly essential to his present argument. But this is true only of the neglect of the positive Levitical precepts of the Law; the neglect of its moral precepts does disqualify him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>). Does it not seem a just inference from this course of argument, that no man whom we have reason to believe to be justified by faith in Christ is to be refused either Christian association or Church fellowship? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-19 Paul, having thus shown he was not inferior to any apostle, not to Peter himself, speaks of the great foundation doctrine of the gospel. For what did we believe in Christ? Was it not that we might be justified by the faith of Christ? If so, is it not foolish to go back to the law, and to expect to be justified by the merit of moral works, or sacrifices, or ceremonies? The occasion of this declaration doubtless arose from the ceremonial law; but the argument is quite as strong against all dependence upon the works of the moral law, as respects justification. To give the greater weight to this, it is added, But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ the minister of sin? This would be very dishonourable to Christ, and also very hurtful to them. By considering the law itself, he saw that justification was not to be expected by the works of it, and that there was now no further need of the sacrifices and cleansings of it, since they were done away in Christ, by his offering up himself a sacrifice for us. He did not hope or fear any thing from it; any more than a dead man from enemies. But the effect was not a careless, lawless life. It was necessary, that he might live to God, and be devoted to him through the motives and grace of the gospel. It is no new prejudice, though a most unjust one, that the doctrine of justification by faith alone, tends to encourage people in sin. Not so, for to take occasion from free grace, or the doctrine of it, to live in sin, is to try to make Christ the minister of sin, at any thought of which all Christian hearts would shudder.</body></html>
