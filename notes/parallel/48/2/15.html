We are thus led, without any real break, from the historical and personal to the doctrinal portion of the Epistle. It is impossible to say exactly where the speech at Antioch ends and where the comment upon it begins; the Apostle glides from one to the other without any conscious division in his own mind. A similar mingling of narrative and comment is found in St. John's Gospel: compare, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31-36</a>, the first of which sections formally belongs to the discourse with Nicodemus, and the second to the reply of John the Baptist, though it is clear that much after comment of the Evangelist's is interwoven with them. If we are to draw a dividing line at all in the section before us, it might be said that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15-16</a> were still most nearly a paraphrase of the words actually addressed to St. Peter; while from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-17.htm" title="But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.">Galatians 2:17</a> onwards the Apostle is giving the rein more freely to his own reflections. The sequence of the thought seems to be somewhat as follows:--<p>We belong by our birth to a privileged people. We are not of Gentile descent, and therefore abandoned to our sins. And yet, with all our privileges, we found that we could get no justification whatever from the Law; and this sent us to Christ. We thus abdicated our privileged position; we put ourselves on the same level as the Gentiles, and became (in the eye of the Law) sinners like them. Sinners? Must we then admit that all Christ has done for us is to make us <span class= "ital">sinners?</span> Far be so irreverent a thought. Our sin consists not in quitting the Law, but in returning to that which has once been abandoned. The function of the Law was preparatory and transitional. The Law itself taught me to expect its own abrogation. It was a stage on the way to Christ. To Him have I given in a complete adhesion. In His death I am severed from ancient ties. In His death I ceased to have any life of my own. All the life I have, man as I am, I owe to Christ, my Saviour. Thus I accept and do not reject and frustrate the gift so freely offered me: whereas, by going back to the Law for justification, I should be practically declaring the death of Christ useless and unprofitable.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Who are.</span>--It will be seen that these words are in italics, and have to be supplied in the Greek. The Received text, which is followed in our version, also I omits a connecting particle, found in the best MSS., at the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>. Restoring this, a better way of taking the whole passage appears to be to supply only the word "are" in the present verse, and make the next mark a certain opposition to it: "We are (indeed) by birth Jews . . . but" (or, <span class= "ital">and yet</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> "knowing as we did that the Law cannot justify any one, we believed on Christ." The first clause is concessive: "We grant you that we were born Jews, and not Gentiles: members of the chosen race, and not sinners." The next clause explains why it was that, with all these privileges, the Christian, though thus born a Jew, transferred his allegiance from the Law to Christ. The reason was that the Law failed in the one great object--to justify us or obtain our acquittal in the sight of God.<p><span class= "bld">By nature</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by birth. The privileges of the Jew belonged to all Jews alike, simply by the more fact that they were Jews.<p><span class= "bld">Sinners.</span>--The word was almost a synonym for "heathen" in the mouth of a strict Jew. Hence there is a slight irony in its use by St. Paul. "I grant you that from our lofty position we can look down upon those poor Gentiles, sinners by virtue of mere descent."<p><span class= "bld">Of the Gentiles.</span>--"Of" in the sense of natural descent: "Of Gentile parentage (and therefore) sinners."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We who are Jews by nature</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">we being Jews by nature</span>; or, <span class="accented">we are Jews by nature.</span> In point of construction, it may be observed that, after <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in the next verse, recent editors concur in inserting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. With this correction of the text, we may either make this fifteenth verse a separate sentence, by supplying <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, "we are Jews by nature," etc., and begin the next verse with the words, "but yet, knowing that... even we believed," etc.; or we may supply in this verse" being," and, conjoining it with "knowing," take the two verses as forming one sentence; thus: "We being Jews... yet knowing that... even we believed," etc. For the general sense, it is quite immaterial which mode of construing we adopt. The Revisers have preferred the latter. The former makes the passage run more smoothly; but this, in construing St. Paul's writings, is by no means a consideration of weight. "We," that is, "I Paul, and thou Cephas," rather than "I Paul, and thou Cephas, with those who are acting with thee;" for we read before, "I said unto Cephas," not" unto Cephas and the rest of the Jews." "By nature;" because we were Jews by birth. But the two expressions, "by nature" and "by birth," are not convertible terms, as is evident from ch. 4:8 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14</a>; the former covers wider ground than the latter. The prerogatives attaching to the natural position of a born Jew were higher than those which appertained to a circumcised proselyte. This is why he adds," by nature." "Jews;" a term of honourable distinction, closely by its etymology connected in the mind of a Hebrew with the notion of "praise" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-8.htm">Genesis 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>); a term, therefore, of theocratic vaunting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And not sinners of the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); <span class="accented">and not of the Gentiles sinners.</span> The word "sinners" must be here taken, not in that purely moral acceptation in which all are "sinners," but in that mixed sense in which moral disapproval was largely tinged with the bigoted disdain which the theocratic Israelite felt for "the uncircumcised;" the Levitically purist Jew for them who, having no" Law "(<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), wallowed in every kind of ceremonial pollution, "unclean," "dogs" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm">Matthew 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). As a notion correlative to that of "Jews," the word is used by our Lord himself when he spoke of his being delivered into the hands of "sinners" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>). As correlative to that of persons fit for the society of the righteous and Levitically holy, it is used by Christ and the evangelists in the phrase, "publicans and sinners," in which it is nearly equivalent to "outcasts." So the apostle uses it here. With an ironical <span class="accented">mimesis</span> of the tone of language which a self-righteous legalist loved to employ, he means in effect, "not come from among Gentiles, sinful outcasts." May not the apostle be imagined to have quite lately heard such phrases from the lips of some of those Pharisee-minded Christians to whom Cephas was unhappily now truckling? For the right appreciation of the train of thought which the apostle is now pursuing, it is important to observe that both Cephas and Paul had reason to regard themselves as having been, before they were justified, <span class="accented">sinners</span> in another sense of the deepest dye. St. Paul felt to the very end of his days that he had once been, and that therefore in himself he still was, a chief of sinners (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>); and surely the wickedness into which Cephas precipitated himself on the morning of his Lord's passion must have left ever alter in <span class="accented">his</span> mind too a similar consciousness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:15-19 Paul, having thus shown he was not inferior to any apostle, not to Peter himself, speaks of the great foundation doctrine of the gospel. For what did we believe in Christ? Was it not that we might be justified by the faith of Christ? If so, is it not foolish to go back to the law, and to expect to be justified by the merit of moral works, or sacrifices, or ceremonies? The occasion of this declaration doubtless arose from the ceremonial law; but the argument is quite as strong against all dependence upon the works of the moral law, as respects justification. To give the greater weight to this, it is added, But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ the minister of sin? This would be very dishonourable to Christ, and also very hurtful to them. By considering the law itself, he saw that justification was not to be expected by the works of it, and that there was now no further need of the sacrifices and cleansings of it, since they were done away in Christ, by his offering up himself a sacrifice for us. He did not hope or fear any thing from it; any more than a dead man from enemies. But the effect was not a careless, lawless life. It was necessary, that he might live to God, and be devoted to him through the motives and grace of the gospel. It is no new prejudice, though a most unjust one, that the doctrine of justification by faith alone, tends to encourage people in sin.
