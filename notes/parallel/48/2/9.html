The way in which St. Paul speaks respectively of St. Peter and St. James is in strict accordance with the historical situation. When he is speaking of the general work of the Church (as in the last two verses) St. Peter is mentioned prominently; when the reference is to a public act of the Church of Jerusalem the precedence is given to St. James.<p><span class= "bld">Who seemed to be pillars.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">who are held</span> (same word as <span class= "ital">reputed</span> above) <span class= "ital">to be pillars.</span> The metaphor is a natural one, and is found not unfrequently in classical writers.

This is the order in which the words stand in the Greek, in which the participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("perceiving of a certainty") stands co-ordinate with the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("when they saw") of ver. 7, so that this latter participle has "James, Cephas, and John" for its subject equally with the former, and vers. 7 and 9 appear as forming one sentence. The expression, "the grace that was given unto me," occurs also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>; in which passages, as well as here, it is used with a definite reference to the office of apostle having been conferred upon him together with the qualification and aid for its efficient discharge. This definite reference to a heavenly gift connected with his official character is prominent in the apostle's use of the word "grace," also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>. The "grace that was given unto him," therefore, sums up the facts of his having been put in trust of the gospel of the uncircumcision, and of God's having wrought on his behalf in his discharge of that trust, which are presented in the two preceding verses. There is not much difference in the meaning of the participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in this verse as compared with the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 7; for as we find the verb "seeing" used with reference to objects not discernible by the bodily sense but perceived only through the medium of evidencing facts, as in ver. 14 of this chapter, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-47.htm">Luke 9:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; so also the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is sometimes used of perceiving, becoming apprised of, some fact, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-38.htm">Mark 6:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-11.htm">Luke 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-9.htm">John 12:9</a>, when there is no clear intention of emphasizing the idea of certain knowledge. Sometimes, however, it seems as if the writer had such intention, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-45.htm">Mark 15:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-46.htm">Luke 8:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>; and probably it was in this more emphatic sense that the apostle here substituted "knowing" for the foregoing "seeing." "James, and Cephas, and John." This James is, no doubt, the same James as appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. holding so prominent and apparently presidential a position in the great meeting of vers. 6-21. The "James" of the old triumvirate of the Gospels, "Peter, James, and John," was now no more. This James, whose personality has been discussed above in note on Galatians 1:19, is named first, before even Cephas and John, though not an apostle, as being the leading "elder" (<span class="accented">bishop</span>, as such a functionary soon got to be designated) of the Church of Jerusalem; for in the classification of the component members of that meeting in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-6.htm">Acts 15:6</a>, "the apostles and the elders," James must be assigned to the latter category. The twelve had no distinctive official connection with this particular Church more than with other Churches; and, therefore, in meetings held at Jerusalem, the presidential position would naturally be conceded, not to any one of the apostles, but to the man who was statedly recognized as the superior "elder" of this particular community. St. John's name is not mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>; but in other places in St. Luke's history "Peter and John" are found acting in conjunction, and this in such a manner as to betoken their holding a very prominent place among the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14</a>). The reason why these three are named, and none but these, is probably that on the occasion referred to these three alone - James as on behalf of the Church of Jerusalem, and Peter and John as on behalf of the twelve - stepped forward at the general request before the meeting, and formally all three clasped hands with Paul and Barnabas in token of their recognizing and ratifying their doctrine and ministry. In reference to the name "Cephas,' it may be observed that St. Paul finds occasion to name this apostle nine times; in seven of these he writes, according to the best manuscripts, "Cephas' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9, 14</a>); in two, "Peter" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7, 8</a>). The Judaizers in the Church, whether at Corinth or in Galatia, in their morbid hankering after whatever was distinctively Jewish, were sure to affect the use of the Hebraic form; on which account, probably, St. Paul, in dealing with these men, is seen so frequently using this form himself. <span class="accented">Those reputed to be pillars.</span> The apostle's object in adding this clause is apparently, to indicate why these three, rather than any others, represented the rest in this act of formal proceeding, and at the same time to intimate to his Galatian readers the supreme character of the attestation thus afforded, both to that gospel of his which certain among the Galatians were now tampering with, and to his official character which those same persons were beginning to disparage. "Pillars." The apostle, years after, in writing to Timothy, speaks of its being the proper function of "the Church of the living God" that she should be "a pillar and settled basis (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the truth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> upholding the truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>). This suggests to us his meaning in using the same figure here. Those three men were by general consent looked up to as especially steadfast upholders of the truth of the gospel or of the Christian cause. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> the "pillar" seems thought of, not so much as upholding a superstructure as of something itself stationary, and also, perhaps, beautiful and glorious. Clement of Rome, in his Epistle to the Corinthians (&sect; 5), borrows the phrase with a more extensive application. The idea couched in the word "Cephas," <span class="accented">rock</span>, is so nearly identical with that of "settled basis," that the like affinity of ideas as led the apostle to connect "pillar" with the latter term in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a> may be supposed to have led him now to connect "pillar" with "Cephas" and his two illustrious brethren. <span class="cmt_word">They gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); they each of them clasped each of us by the right hand, in token that they both did then, and would thereafter continue to, regard us, and we also them, as partners with one another in a common work. We meet with the phrases, "give right hands," "receive right hands," in 1 Macc. 11:50, 52 1 Macc. 13:50, with reference, apparently, to the victor conceding, and the vanquished accepting, terms of peace to be ratified by the mutual clasp of right hands. This, however, is not precisely what is meant in the present case; there is no room here for the notion of reconciliation. Neither seems there intended a signification of love, such as the "kiss of love" would have afforded. This hand-clasp simply ratified by a palpable gesture the formal assurance between the two parties that they regarded each other as friendly partners in a common undertaking. That the use of this gesture in ratifying compact has been very common in all ages, is shown by the instances in Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon' (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), and in Facciolati ("Dextra"), as well as by Bishop Light feet's note on the present passage. Its use among the Jews is attested, not only by the very phrase employed here and in the Maccabees, but by the phrases, "strike hands" and "give one's hand," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>. Josephus's remark in 'Ant.,' 18. 9:3, on the unique inviolability which the Persians, Parthians, and other Oriental nations felt to attach to engagements thus ratified, by no means precludes the supposition that Jews used this gesture of guarantee, but only shows that it was not with them the most sacred of all forms of covenanting: they would, of course, regard an oath by the Name of God as affording a higher sanction. In the case now under consideration there was no "strife" between James, Cephas, and John, and Paul and Barnabas, which needed to be "ended" by "an oath:" the solemn and cordial mutual pressure of the right hand seems just the kind and measure of form appropriate to the circumstances<span class="cmt_word">. That we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">that we unto</span> (or, <span class="accented">for</span>) <span class="accented">the Gentiles</span>, <span class="accented">and themselves unto</span> (or, <span class="accented">for</span>) <span class="accented">the circumcision</span>, without any verb. We have a very similar ellipsis of the verb in a carefully balanced antithesis, and before the same preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm">Romans 5:16</a> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14</a>). We may read it either thus, "should go unto," as in both the Authorized and the Revised Versions; or, "should be ministers for," taking the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> with the like shade of meaning, as in ver. 8. This distribution of the several provinces of work is shown by the subsequent practice on both sides (see note on ver. 7, <span class="accented">subfin.</span>) to have been intended to be geographical rather than national; which understanding is also indicated by the mention in the next verse of "the poor" whom Paul and Barnabas were, notwithstanding this distribution, to bear in mind; they were the poor <span class="accented">in Judaea</span>, the province of James, Cephas, and John. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of the doctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved to preach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.</body></html>
