These last used advice and persuasion; the false brethren demanded with clamour (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>). The phrase rendered <span class="accented">for an hour</span> occurs also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-15.htm">Philemon 1:15</a>. There seems to be an underlying allusion to those occasions on which the apostle did, as he says, "to the Jews become as a Jew, to the weak, weak" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20, 22</a>); but this he would not do when dealing with false brethren, whose aim was in effect to turn gospel freedom into legal slavery. <span class="accented">We</span>; I, Barnabas, Titus. The words <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> most certainly belong to the original text. Not merely does only one uncial manuscript omit them, but their omission would leave behind a sentence self-convicted of absurdity. For it would run thus: "But because of the false brethren without warrant brought in, a set of men who without warrant came in to spy out our liberty, that they might degrade us into slavery, we yielded for a season with subjection, that the truth of the gospel might lastingly abide with you;" - yielded, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by circumcising Titus; for this is what this reading most probably supposes St. Paul to have done. In this sentence the vituperative description of the false brethren, so extended and so intensely emphatic, instead of being an implied argument in favour of the course of action which the apostle states he adopted, namely, concession to those men, both lacks all motive for its introduction here, and works wholly in favour of the opposite course, of resistance to their wishes. The only suitable and logical description of those for whose sake the concession would have been made would have been that they were brethren meaning well, but weak in the faith, who should, by concession for a season, be won over to more perfect accord with the gospel. (On this reading, see Alford, and the fuller discussion of it in Bishop Lightfoot, pp. 121-123.) <span class="accented">By subjection</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>): <span class="accented">in the way of subjection.</span> As <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> In the other passages in which it occurs means the habit or spirit of subjection, and never an act of submission (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>), it probably denotes here subjection of spirit to those who were so authoritatively laying upon us their injunctions, he might give way in a point of this kind in a spirit of brotherly concession; but he would bow to no man's imperative injunction. The article before <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span> is the article before an abstract noun, as in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That the truth of the gospel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The truth, the sure unadulterated doctrine, which is embodied in the gospel, and is its very hinge and substance. The same phrase is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>. The "truth" is that enunciated in ver. 16, and that it is the very essence of the gospel is declared <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. The refusal of Church fellowship to a believer of this gospel except he were circumcised, by just inference vitiated and, indeed, nullified the truth that faith in Christ is the sole and sufficient ground of justification. <span class="cmt_word">Might continue with you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>). Might never cease to have its home with you, to be believingly entertained by you. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is an intensified form of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>, where see note. It is possible that, as Alford observes, the Galatians may not specially have been in St. Paul's mind at that time, but only the Gentile Churches in general; and that for greater impressiveness he applies to the particular what was only shared by it in the general. It is, however, supposable that the cases of the several Churches which he had then lately founded with Barnabas were much in his thoughts at that time; for, as is shown by his numerous references to his specific intercessory prayer, his spirit was incessantly conversant with "all the Churches" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>); and he was anxiously cognizant of efforts made from the very first by legalizing Christians to pervert their faith. It is not certain that <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a> records the first occasion of his visiting the "Galatic country;" he may have been there and founded "the Churches of Galatia" before the occurrences described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>; and the opinion is even held by many that Iconium and Derbe, belonging to the Roman province of Galatia, were two of "the Churches of Galatia" (see Introduction, p. 2). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of the doctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved to preach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.</body></html>
