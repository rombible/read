"I did indeed hold conference with them privately; but with all their advantages, real or assumed, I learnt nothing from them that I did not already know, and they ended by recognising the independence and validity of my mission."<p><span class= "bld">But of these who seemed to be somewhat.</span>--Translate rather, <span class= "ital">But from those who are reputed to be somewhat.</span> The phrase corresponds to "them which are of reputation" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>; and here, as there, it is important to keep the present tense. It is not only "those who <span class= "ital">were</span> of authority at the Council," but "those who <span class= "ital">are</span> the great authorities with you Galatians now." The Apostle speaks with a certain amount of irony. "From these very great authorities, these persons of such especial reputation [I got nothing]."<p><span class= "bld">Whatsoever they were.</span>--We shall, perhaps, not be wrong in keeping to the Authorised version, though some of the best commentators translate rather, <span class= "ital">What they</span> (once) <span class= "ital">were,</span> with a stress on "were," and referring to the advantage which they possessed over St. Paul in having "known Christ after the flesh" through their early call to the Apostleship.<p><span class= "bld">God accepteth no man's person.</span>--This phrase is a curious instance of a Greek expression framed after the analogy of the Hebrew, and yet in the process contracting a different signification, through the influence of the idiomatic use of one of the Greek expressions involved. "To accept the face" in the Old Testament is used in a good sense of "showing favour" to any one, but without any imputation of partiality. "To accept the face" (or <span class= "ital">person</span>) in the New Testament always carries with it the idea of partiality; the word for "face" being idiomatically used for "a mask," and hence coming to mean "the outward, assumed, accidental characteristics of a man" as opposed to his real and inward character. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm" title="And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.">Matthew 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-21.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:">Luke 20:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm" title="And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-25.htm" title=" But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons.">Colossians 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-9.htm" title="But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.">James 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm" title="These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.">Jude 1:16</a>.) The meaning here is that even if the elder Apostles had "seen with their eyes," and "looked upon and handled the Word of Life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>), God would not regard the advantages implied in this more than any other external advantage of birth, position, natural gifts, &c.<p><span class= "bld">For they who seemed to be somewhat.</span>--The same phrase as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a> : <span class= "ital">they who were of reputation.</span> There is here another break in the regular construction of the sentence. The Apostle begins as if he were going to finish differently: "From those who are reputed to be somewhat . . . I received nothing in the conference which I had with them;" but he suddenly changes his point of view: "From those who are reputed to be somewhat" (sentence left unfinished) "to me, I say, these reputable persons added nothing."<p><span class= "bld">In conference added nothing.</span>--"Added in conference" is all one word in the Greek, and corresponds to "communicated" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>. The idea of "adding" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> imparting fresh knowledge) seems, however, to be derived rather from the context than from the form of the Greek compound, as our translators apparently supposed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But of these who seemed to be somewhat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">now from those who were reputed to be somewhat.</span> The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> does not seem to be adversative here, but simply introductory of a new particular. The writer is about to introduce, which he does in the next five verses (6-10), a fresh illustration of the independent position, which in point both of doctrine and of ministerial footing he held in relation to the first apostles and to the heads of the Jerusalemite Church, and at the same time of the full recognition which in both respects these had accorded to him. The construction of this sentence, as it proceeds, is interrupted and changed. When St. Paul wrote, <span class="accented">from those who were reputed to be somewhat</span>, he would seem to have meant to add, "I received nothing fresh either in knowledge of the gospel or in authority as Christ's minister," or some-tiring to that effect; but in his indignant parenthesis asserting his independence with respect to those whom his gainsayers in Galatia would seem to have pronounced his superiors, both in knowledge and in office, he loses sight of the beginning of the sentence, and begins it afresh in another form with the words (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented">for they who were of repute</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Reputed to be somewhat</span>; that is, thought highly cf. The phrase is of frequent occurrence, both in Greek and in Latin authors. It is obvious that he refers to the twelve and the leaders of the mother Church of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">of what sort they at any time were maketh no matter to me.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (of what sort) is suggested by the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (somewhat), and the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (they were) by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (reputed); from those reputed to be somewhat whatever they really were. The comparison of the usage of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in other passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-29.htm">Acts 26:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-24.htm">James 1:24</a>) hardly favours the specific interpretation, "how great." In respect to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>, in a classical author, as Bishop Light foot observes, we should have no hesitation in taking it as equivalent to <span class="accented">cunque.</span> But the word occurs in the New Testament in thirty-one ether places, and in not one is it <span class="accented">eunque</span>, but always the adverb of time, either "sometime," "in time past," as above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-13.htm">John 9:13</a>; or "any time," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>. The latter shade of meaning seems the more appropriate here. The <span class="accented">any time</span>, though not to be limited to, would, however, cover the time when the twelve were in personal attendance upon our Lord - a circumstance which St. Paul's detractors were no doubt wont to hold up as a mark of distinction not possessed by him. It seems best to take of <span class="accented">what sort</span> as dependent upon the following words, <span class="accented">maketh no matter to me.</span> This last clause is not exactly equivalent to "I care not," as if it were an almost supercilious waving aside of the consideration; it is rather a grave assertion of a matter of fact. Whatever were the gifts of knowledge and spiritual insight which the twelve or other heads of the Jerusalemite Church possessed, or whatever their ministerial privileges or authority, whether derived from personal intercourse with the Lord Jesus when upon earth or in any other way, Paul's knowledge of the gospel and Paul's apostolic authority were neither of them at all affected by them. Now, at the time that he is writing this Epistle, he was just the same in respect to the possession of the essential truth of the gospel and to his apostolic authority as if he had had no intercourse with the spiritual rulers of the Jewish Church. <span class="cmt_word">God accepteth no man's person</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The order of the words in the Greek throws especial emphasis upon "person:" <span class="accented">person of man God accepteth not</span>; that is, it is never on account of his person that God accepteth a man. This phrase, "accept a man's person," is of frequent occurrence in the Bible. In the New Testament it is always used in a bad sense, which in the Old is by no means the case. This difference is due, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, to the secondary sense of <span class="accented">actor's mask</span> attaching to the Greek noun, the actor on the Greek stage, as also on the Roman, being wont to wear a mask suited to the character in which he appeared; whence also <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> got to signify this character itself. The corresponding technical term among the Romans was <span class="accented">persona</span>, a word never used of the natural face, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was. This explains the adoption of this last term in its Anglicized form by our English translators in the phrase now before us. With the like metaphorical application of the idea as that which was so common among the Romans, the word "<span class="accented">per</span>son" seemed well fitted to denote the part, or certain accessories of the part, which a man plays on the stage, so to speak, of human life, in contradistinction to his more interior and essential character. The phrase denotes accepting a man, for example, for his worldly rank or position, for his office, for his nationality, even for his Church status (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-17.htm">1 Peter 1:17</a>). The special adjuncts of a man's <span class="accented">person</span> referred to in the present passage are those of the outward call aforetime to be apostles and personal attendants upon the Lord Jesus while upon earth, and, in the case of St. James the Lord's brother, personal relationship to him. And St. Paul means to intimate that <span class="accented">his</span> knowledge of Divine truth and <span class="accented">his</span> ministerial fidelity and efficiency might be as real and as great, if God's will were so, as the knowledge and ministerial fidelity and efficiency of the twelve and St. James, whom his gainsayers were honouring so far above him merely for their <span class="accented">person's</span> sake. God made no such difference between him and them, but wrought with him just as much. <span class="cmt_word">For they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <span class="accented">for to me they who were of repute in conference added nothing.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, as it stands here, appears related to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 2. I laid before them my gospel; they imparted to me nothing fresh (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Thus Chrysostom and Theodoret. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>, where the same verb occurs (see note), there is nothing to accentuate the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as there is here. The "for" appears related to the foregoing clause. That God does not respect man for his person was evidenced by the fact that Paul's knowledge of the gospel was already so complete and his work was so honoured by God, that those whose <span class="accented">person</span> seemed to many so markedly superior to his, found that all they had to do was to frankly recognize his teaching as already adequate and complete, and his work as standing on a perfectly equal footing with their own. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of the doctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved to preach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.</body></html>
