By what particular form of revelation he was guided in this instance does not appear. It would seem that this inward spiritual guidance granted privately to the Apostle coincided with a formal commission from the Church at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-2.htm" title="When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.">Acts 15:2</a>), which, as the external and apparent side of the transaction, is naturally related by the historian, while it is just as naturally omitted by the Apostle, whose thoughts are directed rather to his own personal conduct and motives.<p><span class= "bld">Communicated unto them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Church at Jerusalem. A distinction appears to be drawn between what the Apostle said in his public intercourse with the Church and the more detailed conference or conferences into which he entered privately with the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">Which I preach.</span>--The present tense is noticeable. The gospel which the Apostle had been preaching up to the time of the Council of Jerusalem was the same as that which he still preached at the time of his writing to the Galatians. It had undergone no change in its essential features, especially in the one doctrine which he was most anxious to impress upon the Galatians--the doctrine of justification by faith.<p><span class= "bld">Privately to them which were of reputation.</span>--Better, more simply, <span class= "ital">to them of repute.</span> The present tense is again used, the Apostle hinting, not only at the position which the Judaic Apostles held at the time of the Council, but also at the way in which their authority was appealed to by the Judaising partisans in Galatia. There is a slight shade of irony in the expression. It is not so much "those which <span class= "ital">were</span> of reputation" in the gathering at Jerusalem as "those who <span class= "ital">are still</span> held to be the only authorities <span class= "ital">now."</span><p>Who are meant by "them of repute" appears more distinctly from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>, where James, Peter, and John are mentioned by name.<p><span class= "bld">Lest by</span> <span class= "bld">any means.</span>--The Apostle did not really want confidence in his own teaching. And yet he was aware that it rested solely upon his own individual conviction, and upon the interpretation that he had put upon the intimation to him of the divine will. There was, therefore, still a certain element of uncertainty and room for confirmation, which the Apostle desired to receive. His character hits the happy mean between confidence in his cause (self-confidence, or self-reliance, as it would be called if dealing with a lower sphere), without which no great mission can be accomplished, and opinionatedness or obstinacy. He, therefore, wished to "make assurance doubly sure," and it is this confirmed and ratified certainty which animates his whole language in writing to the Galatians. Something of it, perhaps, is reflected back upon his account of the earlier stages in the process through which his opinions had gone, given in the last chapter.<p><span class= "bld">I should run, or had run.</span>--St. Paul here introduces his favourite metaphor from the foot-races, such as he might see in the Isthmian games at Corinth.

The form of sentence in the Greek is similar to that(<span class="accented">e.g.</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>: a word of the preceding context is taken up afresh for the purpose of being qualified or explained. Revelations were frequently made to the apostle, both to communicate important truths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>) and to direct or encourage his proceedings. They appear to have been made in different ways: as, through dreams or visions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>); through prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>); often, no doubt, through a strong impulse borne in upon his spirit, prompting him to, or debarring him from, some particular line of conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6, 7</a>). The journey now in question being that recorded by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, <span class="accented">init.</span>), we have to observe that St. Luke ascribes his going to a decision come to by the brethren at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a>). But there is no discrepancy here. It is an obvious supposition, that the apostle, taking into consideration, perhaps, the prejudice entertained against him at Jerusalem, not only, as Christ had himself intimated to him, by the unbelieving Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a>), but, as James later on confessed, by even the members of the Church itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>; comp. on both points, Romans 16:31), felt at first some hesitation in accepting the commission; was he by going likely to forward their views? - but that his hesitation was overruled by Christ himself, who in some way revealed to him that it was his will that he should go. Similarly, when visiting Jerusalem for the first time after his conversion, his hasty departure from the city is attributed by St. Luke to the care of the disciples for his safety (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>); whereas St. Paul, in his speech from the stairs, ascribes it to a" trance," in which the Lord appearing to him bade him to depart thence without delay (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17, 21</a>) The two accounts in each instance are mutually supplementary, the one viewing the case historically from the outside, the other as an autobiographical reminiscence from within. The apostle's reason for thus pointedly mentioning the especial direction under which he took this journey, had evidently reference to its being the design of Christ, that thereby, together with other objects to be subserved by it, the doctrine and ministerial work of Paul should be sealed with the recognition of his first apostles and of his earliest Church - a result of prime necessity for the prosperous development of the whole Church; more important, perhaps, than even its more ostensible result as described by St. Luke. <span class="cmt_word">And communicated unto them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and I laid before them.</span> The verb occurs in the New Testament besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-14.htm">Acts 25:14</a>, where it means simply giving the king an account of Paul's case with the view apparently of getting his opinion upon it. In the present case St. Paul stated his doctrine to the persons referred to, with the view likewise of seeing what they would say; but certainly not with any intention of having it modified by their suggestions (cf. the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in 2 Macc. 3:9, which presents a curiously similar conjunction of particulars). By <span class="accented">them</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">those there</span>, are obviously meant, not the inhabitants in general, but the Christians of the place, though not immediately before mentioned. We have the like use of the pronoun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That gospel which I preach</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>). The present tense of the verb points to the whole period of his ministry up to the time at which he was writing. It is implied that his teaching had been the same all along. Elsewhere he styles it "my gospel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Among the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); alluding to the complexion of his doctrine as bearing upon the acceptance of Gentiles before God simply upon their faith in Christ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But privately</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, occurs sixteen times besides in the New Testament, always in the sense of <span class="accented">privately</span>, <span class="accented">apart</span> (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them which were of reputation</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">them who were of repute</span>; men eminent in repute and position. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, was used in this sense both in classical Greek and in the later "common dialect" (Eurip., 'Hec.,' 294; 'Heracl.,' 897; 'Tread.,' 617; 'Herodian,' 6:1). There is no reason to suppose that there is any tone of disparagement in the phrase, as if the persons spoken of "<span class="accented">seemed"</span> to be more than they really were. The apostle repeats this participle thrice in the following context - once (ver. 6), as here, absolutely; and twice (vers. 6, 9) with an infinitive. This harping upon <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> suggests a surmise that St. Paul's gainsayers in Galatia had been fond of using the expression to designate the persons referred to in disparagement of himself as a man comparatively of no mark. Compare the almost mocking reiteration of "superlatively chief apostles," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a> and 12. l 1, referring to "pseudo-apostles." In order to determine who were the persons the apostle thus distinguishes, we naturally refer to St. Luke's account of the circumstances. St. Luke, then, seems to speak of three several meetings held on this occasion. The first (in ver. 4) when Paul and Barnabas with their fellow-deputies, were "received by the Church and the apostles and the elders;" when "they [Paul and Barnabas] declared what great things God had done in co-operation with them." It cannot have been then that St. Paul gave this exposition of his gospel. But certain of the Pharisees who had joined the Church began loudly to insist upon the necessity of Gentile converts being circumcised and conforming to the Law. Whether it was at this first meeting itself that this took place, or subsequently, at all events "the apostles and the elders" judged it to be undesirable that the matter should be further discussed in so large an assemblage of the circumcision, before, in the calmer atmosphere of a private conference, they had themselves considered what course it would be best to adopt. Accordingly, St. Luke tells us (ver. 6), "the apostles and the elders came together to see about this matter." "After much discussion had taken place," which upon a question so closely touching the Jew's national sensibilities must even in this more select body have been fraught with no ordinary excitement, the rising passions of controversy were stilled by Peter; he recalled the story of Cornelius, and founding thereupon, he warned his hearers, that by imposing, as many perhaps even of those then present were wishful to do, the intolerable yoke of Mosaism upon the neck of the Gentile disciples, they ran the risk of contravening and provoking God; for after all (he significantly reminded them), their own hope of salvation, as well as the hope of Gentile believers, was that they would be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus. Thereupon the "whole company" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in ver. 12, is used by St. Luke in the same way as in his Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-1.htm">Luke 23:1</a>) when speaking of the Sanhedrin; the eldership of the very large Church of Jerusalem must of itself, without the doubtful addition of elders from Judaean towns, have formed a considerable body) listened with hushed and respectful attention to Paul and Barnabas, while they gave a detailed account of what great signs and wonders God had wrought amongst the Gentiles through them. After this, upon James's proposition, "the apostles and the elders" came to the resolution that, in conjunction with the whole Church, they would choose and depute certain members of their community to convey to the Gentile brethren a certain letter, which very probably (cf. as to diction, vers. 17, 23, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>) James himself, as presiding in their meeting, with the concurrence of the apostles and the elders, drew up. The words," with the whole Church," coming in here for the first time since ver. 4, indicate a third meeting, in which the general body of believers was prevailed upon to concur in the measures before agreed upon in the second more private meeting. According to the more approved reading of ver. 23 (omitting the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>), the letter issues from "the apostles and the elder brethren" alone, as these also were the persons with whom (ver. 2) the deputation from Antioch had been sent to confer. Now, upon the review of all the circumstances as now stated, the second of these three meetings would seem to have presented just such an opportunity as would suit the design which St. Paul had frowned, of expounding his teaching to the leading spirits in Jerusalem. When he and Barnabas were relating those signs and wonders by which the seal of Divine sanction had been put upon their ministry among the Gentiles, it was natural that Paul, here no doubt, as generally "the chief speaker," should tell their hearers with the utmost distinctness what that teaching was which Heaven had thus ratified; most especially that part of it which was so directly relevant to the practical question which was then in debate, and which is so emphatically set forth in the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans - to wit, that all who believe in Christ are justified and have full peace and sonship with God without any works of Mosaical ceremonialism. This was precisely "the gospel" which here (ver. 2) he speaks of as "preached by him among the Gentiles" "The apostles and the elders" answer perfectly to the description of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. For there is no reason for supposing that the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of vers. 2 and 6, or the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 6, represent exactly the same persons as the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 9. These last are to be conceived of rather as representative of those larger bodies of men recited in the former three references - "James" representing the elders (for the present writer makes no question but that this James "the Lord's brother" was the presiding officer or Bishop of the Church of Jerusalem, and not one of the twelve apostles), and "Cephas and John" representing the twelve, who may be believed to have been all of them at Jerusalem at this time, though these two, certainly the leading ones, are the only ones whose names there happened to be occasion for specifying. <span class="cmt_word">Lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).

The present tense, <span class="accented">lest I should be running</span>, points to the time of which he is writing and the time onward therefrom. In classical Greek it would have been <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, "run," "rush on," a favourite word with the apostle, well characterizes the zealous forward, speeding manner of his activity. "In vain;" to an empty result; for no good. He intimates that there had been a danger lest the fruits of his earnest work among the Gentiles, might through some cause get wrecked. That this is what he means is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a> just cited; and not that there had been any fear lest he might himself have been somehow mistaking his way; most especially, not lest he had been at all mistaken in the doctrine which he taught, a thing which he does not for one moment imagine. His work <span class="accented">would</span> have been in danger of being spoilt if the Gentile Churches as planted by himself had been disowned or discountenanced by the mother Church, or if they had got split up into factious parties by the intervention, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of persons coming "from James," telling them that they were not in a state of salvation. To guard against this danger, he was led by Christ himself to seek a formal recognition of his doctrine by the apostles and the elders of the Jerusalemite Church, and through them by that Church itself. As the rank-and-file of the Jewish believers at Jerusalem were even bigotedly attached to the Mosaic Law, and also regarded St. Paul himself with great suspicion, he might very easily have failed of gaining the recognition he required, if he had at once brought the matter before the general body. If their spiritual leaders had not first come forward in the cause of truth, it was but too probable that some fanatical Mosaists would have gained the ear of the multitude, and hurried them away in a course of headlong opposition to Paul and his teaching, from which it might have been very difficult afterwards to recall them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of the doctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved to preach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.</body></html>
