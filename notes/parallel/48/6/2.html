Our Lord Himself was said to "bear" the physical infirmities of those whom He healed. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a> : "He bare our sicknesses.")<p><span class= "bld">So fulfil.</span>--The reading here is somewhat doubtful, and the balance of authorities interesting. On the one hand, for the Received text adopted in our version is a large majority of the MSS.; on the other hand, the reading, <span class= "ital">ye shall fulfil,</span> is found in the Vatican and two good Graeco-Latin<span class= "note">[62]</span> MSS., but has besides <span class= "ital">an almost unanimous support</span> from the versions. As several of these were composed at a very early date, and as they necessarily represent a wide geographical dispersion; as, further, the MS. authority for the reading--though small in quantity is good in quality--also representing the evidence of widely separated regions; and as, finally, the internal evidence or probabilities of corruption are also in favour of the same reading, it would seem, on the whole, to have the greater claim to acceptance. The meaning is that by showing sympathy to others in their distress, of whatever kind that distress may be--whether physical, mental, or moral--the Christian will best fulfil that "new commandment" bequeathed to him by his Master, the "law of love." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1John 3:23</a>.)<p><span class= "note">[62] Practically, these two MSS. can only count as one as both seem to have been copied from the same original.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bear ye one another's burdens</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">carry ye</span>, or, <span class="accented">be ready to carry</span>, <span class="accented">the heavy loads of one another.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> gives it especial prominence; as it stands here it seems pregnant with the exhortation, look not every man only at his own griefs, but at the griefs also of others" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, weight, points to an excessive weight, such as it is a toil to carry. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-12.htm">Matthew 20:12</a>, "who have borne the burden (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) and heat of the day." So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, "weight of glory," the phrase, suggested by the double sense of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">kabhod</span>, indicates the enormous greatness of the future glory. The supposition that the apostle was glancing at the burden of Mosaical observances, superseded as a matter for care on our part by the burdens of our brethren, seems far-fetched. These "heavy loads" are those which a man brings upon himself by acts of transgression: such as an uneasy conscience; difficulties in his domestic, social, or Church relations; pecuniary embarrassments; or other. But the precept seems to go beyond the requirements of the particular case of a peccant brother which has suggested it, and to take in all the needs, spiritual or secular, which we are subject to. (For <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of carrying a toilsome burden, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And so fulfil the law of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> [or, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">and so fulfil</span> (or, <span class="accented">ye shall fulfil</span>) <span class="accented">the law of Christ.</span> The sense comes to much the same, whether in the Greek we read the future indicative or the aorist imperative. If the imperative be retained, it yet adds no new element of precept to the foregoing; the clause so read <span class="accented">prescribes</span> the fulfilment of Christ's law in the particular form of bearing one another's burdens. If we read the future, the clause <span class="accented">affirms</span> that in so doing we shall fulfil his law; which in the other case is implied. Many have supposed the word "law" to be here used for a specific commandment; as for example Christ's new commandment that we should love one another, So St. James (it. 8) writes of the "royal law." St. Paul, however, never uses the term in this sense in his own writing, though in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 8:10; 10:16), the plural "laws" occurs in citation from Jeremiah. It seems better to take it of the whole moral institution of Christ, whether conveyed in distinct precept or in his example and spirit of action. Compare with the present passage the advice which St. Paul gives the "strong" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1-4</a>), that they should bear (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as here, "carry") the infirmities of the weak, and not wish to please themselves; after Christ's pattern set forth in prophetical Scripture, of old time written in order to instruct us how we should act. It has been often observed that the phrase, "the law of Christ," was selected with allusion to the stir now being made among the Galatians respecting the Law of Moses. "Satisfy ye the requirements of the Law - not of Moses which some are prating about, but the law of Christ, a more perfect law than that other, and more our proper con-corn." Possibly the words <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> were added as a pointed surprise of style - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, as the scholiasts on Aristophanes are wont to express it - "and thus fulfil the law - of Christ!" <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 We are to bear one another's burdens. So we shall fulfil the law of Christ. This obliges to mutual forbearance and compassion towards each other, agreeably to his example. It becomes us to bear one another's burdens, as fellow-travellers. It is very common for a man to look upon himself as wiser and better than other men, and as fit to dictate to them. Such a one deceives himself; by pretending to what he has not, he puts a cheat upon himself, and sooner or later will find the sad effects. This will never gain esteem, either with God or men. Every one is advised to prove his own work. The better we know our own hearts and ways, the less shall we despise others, and the more be disposed to help them under infirmities and afflictions. How light soever men's sins seem to them when committed, yet they will be found a heavy burden, when they come to reckon with God about them. No man can pay a ransom for his brother; and sin is a burden to the soul. It is a spiritual burden; and the less a man feels it to be such, the more cause has he to suspect himself. Most men are dead in their sins, and therefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin. Feeling the weight and burden of our sins, we must seek to be eased thereof by the Saviour, and be warned against every sin.</body></html>
