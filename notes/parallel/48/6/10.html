The Church is represented as a household in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1Peter 4:17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As we have therefore</span> <span class="cmt_word">opportunity</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">so then</span>, <span class="accented">while</span> (or, <span class="accented">as</span>) <span class="accented">we have a season for so doing.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>: this combination of particles is frequently found in St. Paul's writings, being so far as appears (cf. Winer, 'Gram. N.T.,' &sect; 53, 8<span class="accented">a</span>) peculiar to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-18.htm">Romans 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-12.htm">Romans 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>). In every instance it marks a certain pause after a statement of premisses; in several, following a citation from the Old Testament; the writer, after waiting, so to speak, for the reader duly to Lake into his mind what has been already said, proceeds to draw his inference. The <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> seems to point backward to the premisses; the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> to introduce the inference. "Well, then," or "so, then," appears a fairly equivalent rendering. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> introduces a cohortative verb, as here; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>, an imperative. The words Which follow seem to be commonly understood as meaning "whenever opportunity offers." But this fails short of recognizing the solemn consideration of the proprieties of the present sowing-time, which the previous context prepares us to expect to find here; the term "season," as Meyer remarks, having its proper reference already fixed by the antithetical season of reaping referred to in ver. 9. Moreover, instead of for, would not the apostle, if he had meant "whenever," have used the intensified form <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>? Chrysostom gives the sense well thus: "As it is not always in our power to sow, so neither is it to show mercy; when we have been borne hence, though we may desire it a thousand times, we shall be able to effect nothing." Indeed it is questionable whether the sense now pleaded for is not that which was intended by the rendering in the Authorized Version. The particle <span class="greek">&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> probably means "while," as it does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35, 36</a>, where it should replace the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of the Textus Receptus; but this needs not to be insisted upon. Anyway, we are reminded of the uncertain tenure by which we hold the season for doing that which, if done, will have so blessed a consequence. <span class="cmt_word">Let us do good unto all men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">let us be workers of that which is good towards all men.</span> The verbs <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span> appear used inter-changeably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-5.htm">3 John 1:5</a>; but the former seems to suggest, more vividly than the other, either the concrete action, the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which is wrought; or else the part enacted by the agent as being a worker of such or such a description - as if, here, it were "let us be benefactors." The adjective "good" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is often, perhaps most commonly, used to designate what is morally excellent in general; thus, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-10.htm">Romans 2:10</a>, "the worker of that which is go,d" is contrasted with "the worker-out of that which is evil," as a description of a man's moral character in general. But on the other hand, this adjective frequently takes the sense of "benevolent," "beneficent;" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>, "Is thine eye evil, because I am good?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>, "masters, not only the good and gentle, but also the froward;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-18.htm">1 Timothy 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>. In the remarkable contrast between the righteous man and the good man in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-7.htm">Romans 5:7</a> (see Dr. Gifford's note on the passage, 'Speaker's Commentary,' p. 123), the latter term appears distinctly intended in the conception of virtuousness to make especially prominent the idea of beneficence. Naturally, this sense attaches to it, when it describes an action <span class="accented">done to another</span>, as the opposite to the "working ill to one's neighbour," mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>; "good" in such a relation, denoting what is beneficent in effect, denotes what is also benevolent in intention (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>). Indeed, that the present clause points to works of beneficence" is made certain by that which is added, "and especially," etc.; for our behaviour should be in no greater degree marked by general moral excellence in dealing with one class of men than in dealing with any others; though <span class="accented">one particular branch</span> of virtuous action may be called into varying degrees of activity in different relations of human intercourse. "Towards all men;" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, towards, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>. The spirit of universal philanthropy which the apostle inculcates here as in other passages, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>, is one which flows naturally from the proper influence upon the mind of the great facts stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-3.htm">1 Timothy 2:3-7</a>, as also it was a spirit which in a most eminent degree animated the apostle's own life. Witness that noble outburst of universal benevolence which we read of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-29.htm">Acts 26:29</a>. Such an escape from bigotry and <span class="accented">particularism</span> was quite novel to the Gentile world, and scarcely heard of in the Jewish, though beautifully pointed forward to in the teaching of the Book of Jonah (see Introduction to the Book of Jonah, in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 6. p. 576). <span class="cmt_word">Espescially</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto them who are of the household of faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but especially towards them that are of the household of faith.</span> The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in the New Testament only in St. Paul's Epistles - twice besides here, namely, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>, "fellow-citizens with the saints, and <span class="accented">of the household</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)of God;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, "if any provideth not for his own, and specially <span class="accented">his own household</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." In the last-cited passage, the adjective, denoting as it plainly is meant to do, a closer relation than "his own (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" must mean members of his household or family; and we can hardly err in supposing that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a> likewise the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> denotes those whom God has admitted into his family as children. So the word also signifies in the Septuagint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6, 12, 13</a>. It is, therefore, an unnecessary dilution of its force here to render it, "those who belong to the faith," though such a rendering of it might be justified if found in an ordinary Greek author. The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> is illustrated by the strong personification used before by the apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23, 25</a>, "before faith came;" "shut up for the faith which was yet to be revealed;" "now that faith is come." The apostle surely here is not thinking of "the Christian doctrine," but of that principle of believing acceptance of God's promises which he has been insisting upon all through the Epistle. This principle, again personified, is here the patron or guardian of God's people afore-time under a <span class="accented">pedagogue</span>: "of the household of faith," not "of the faith." The apostle is thinking of those who sympathized with the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ without legal observances; and very possibly is glancing in particular at the teachers under whose care the apostle had left the Galatian Churches. At first, we may believe, the Galatian Churchmen, in the fervour of their affection to the apostle himself, had been willing enough to help those teachers in every way. But when relaxing their hold upon the fundamental principles of the gospel, they had also declined in their affectionate maintenance of the teachers who upheld those doctrines. He now commends these, belonging to faith's own household, to their especial regard (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>). "Especially;" this qualification in an intensified form of the precept of universal beneficence, is the outcome of no cold calculation of relative duties, but of fervent love towards those who are truly brethren in Christ. That to these an especial affection is due above all others is a sentiment commended and inculcated in almost all St. Paul's Epistles; as it is also by St. Peter, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>, etc.; and again by St. John. With all, "love of brethren (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)" is a different sentiment from that sentiment of charity which is due to all fellow-men; that is, it is an intensified form of this latter, exalted into a peculiar tenderness of regard by the admixture of higher relations than those which antecedently connect true Christians with all members of the human family. Christ has himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>) taught his disciples that he deems a peculiar regard to be due from them to those "his brethren" who at that day shall be on his right hand; meaning, evidently, by "these my brethren," not suffering men, women, or children as such, but sufferers peculiarly belonging to himself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-5.htm">Matthew 18:5, 6</a>). Thus we see that, after all, there is a <span class="accented">particularism</span> properly characteristic of Christian sentiment; only, not such a particularism as a Gentile, and too often a Jew likewise, would have formulated thus: "Thou shalt love thine own people and hate the alien;" but one which may be formulated thus: "Thou shalt love every man, but especially thy fellow-believer in Christ." The reader will, perhaps, scarcely need to be reminded of Keble's exquisite piece on the Second Sunday after Trinity in the 'Christian Year.' <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Many excuse themselves from the work of religion, though they may make a show, and profess it. They may impose upon others, yet they deceive themselves if they think to impose upon God, who knows their hearts as well as actions; and as he cannot be deceived, so he will not be mocked. Our present time is seed time; in the other world we shall reap as we sow now. As there are two sorts of sowing, one to the flesh, and the other to the Spirit, so will the reckoning be hereafter. Those who live a carnal, sensual life, must expect no other fruit from such a course than misery and ruin. But those who, under the guidance and influences of the Holy Spirit, live a life of faith in Christ, and abound in Christian graces, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. We are all very apt to tire in duty, particularly in doing good. This we should carefully watch and guard against. Only to perseverance in well-doing is the reward promised. Here is an exhortation to all to do good in their places. We should take care to do good in our life-time, and make this the business of our lives. Especially when fresh occasions offer, and as far as our power reaches.</body></html>
