The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, is well illustrated by the passage cited by critics from Plato's 'Apologia,' p. 41, E: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,... <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> "Something" is, by a common meiosis, put for "something considerable" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>). The especial form of eminence, the claim to which is here referred to, is eminence in spirituality and consistency as a servant of Christ. Possibly the apostle has in his eye certain individuals among the Galatians that he had heard of, who, professing much, were, however, self-complacently bitter and contemptuous towards brethren who had gone wrong in moral conduct or who differed from themselves in the disputes then rife in those Churches. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, "being nothing," is a part of the hypothesis relative to the individual case spoken of, not a statement putting forth the aphorism that no one is really anything. The passage quoted above from Plato shows, that in the latter case we should have had <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>. Some men, by the grace of God, <span class="accented">are</span> "something;" but these persons only fancy themselves to be so. Whether any man is really "something" or not is determined by his practical conduct - his "work" as the apostle expresses it in the next verse. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in the New Testament only here, though we have the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, deceivers, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-10.htm">Titus 1:10</a>. St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>) speaks of a man "deceiving his heart ' in seemingly just the same sense. In both passages it appears to be meant that a man palms off upon his own mind fancies as if they were just apprehensions of real facts; in both also these fancies are but illusive notions of one's own religious character - here, as being "spiritual;" in James, as being "religious" or "devout" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">- the</span> activity of practical benevolence being in both cases wanting; for "<span class="accented">the</span> bridling not his tongue" in ver. 26 is proved by the contrasted behaviour spoken of in the next verse to refer to those <span class="accented">sins</span> of the tongue which are implicitly condemned in vers. 19-21. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 We are to bear one another's burdens. So we shall fulfil the law of Christ. This obliges to mutual forbearance and compassion towards each other, agreeably to his example. It becomes us to bear one another's burdens, as fellow-travellers. It is very common for a man to look upon himself as wiser and better than other men, and as fit to dictate to them. Such a one deceives himself; by pretending to what he has not, he puts a cheat upon himself, and sooner or later will find the sad effects. This will never gain esteem, either with God or men. Every one is advised to prove his own work. The better we know our own hearts and ways, the less shall we despise others, and the more be disposed to help them under infirmities and afflictions. How light soever men's sins seem to them when committed, yet they will be found a heavy burden, when they come to reckon with God about them. No man can pay a ransom for his brother; and sin is a burden to the soul. It is a spiritual burden; and the less a man feels it to be such, the more cause has he to suspect himself. Most men are dead in their sins, and therefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin. Feeling the weight and burden of our sins, we must seek to be eased thereof by the Saviour, and be warned against every sin.</body></html>
