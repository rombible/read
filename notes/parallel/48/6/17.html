He will not dally with these vexatious attacks upon himself and his authority any more. He dismisses them with an appeal which ought to be final. He points to the scars of wounds which he had received in his Master's service. The branding-irons of Christ, he says, have imprinted these upon me. They show that I, like the slaves of a heathen temple, am devoted and consecrated to His service. They are my credentials, and I shall produce no others. My assailants must leave me in peace.<p><span class= "bld">The marks.</span>--The <span class= "ital">stigmata,</span> or marks inflicted with branding-irons, such as those which show that a slave is attached to a particular temple or to the service of some particular deity. Branding was applied in some other cases, but especially to temple slaves. Those with which the Galatians were most familiar would be engaged in the worship of Cybele.<p>There does not seem to be evidence to connect this passage directly with the incident of the "stigmata" in the life of St. Francis of Assisi, but it would seem very probable that the use of the word, which was left untranslated in the Latin versions, suggested, whether by a more or by a less distant association, the idea which took so strong a hold upon his mind that in a moment of extreme spiritual tension the actual marks of the Passion seemed to imprint themselves upon his body.<p><span class= "bld">Of the Lord Jesus.</span>--The true text is simply, "of Jesus."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From henceforth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). This genitive form is found, in the New Testament, only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>, where the Textus Receptus reads <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. As being less ambiguous, it is chosen in preference to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, because this latter word is also used in the sense "finally," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, as well as for "henceforth," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-13.htm">Hebrews 10:13</a>. The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is illustrated by Aristophanes, 'Pax.,' 1050, "You shall never dine henceforth (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) any more in the Prytaneum;" and Herod., 3:15. <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">no man trouble me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "cause trouble, or annoyance," occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-10.htm">Matthew 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-7.htm">Luke 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-5.htm">Luke 18:5</a>. Obviously the apostle refers to such trouble as was now accruing to him from the endeavours of the Judaizing party to pervert his Galatian disciples. On him fell the "anxiety of all the Churches" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>). In any of his Gentile Churches, the defeat of the work of the gospel by Judaizing perversion was a "worry" which touched him to the very quick. There is nothing to warrant the supposition that he alludes to assaults made in particular upon his apostolical authority, such as he had often occasion to deal with, <span class="accented">as</span>, for example, at Corinth. None such have been referred to in this Epistle, though he has found occasion to complain of the alienated affections of his converts. <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">I am one who bear branded on my body the flesh-marks of Jesus.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is inserted with emphasis. Being such as he here describes himself, he had a claim upon his brethren to be spared unnecessary annoyance. The Greek word <span class="accented">stigma</span> here employed denotes a mark on the flesh, either by <span class="accented">puncture</span>, its proper sense, with a hot, sharp instrument, very often with hot needles (see Prudentius's lines quoted by Grotius in his note on the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, mark, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>), or more summarily by simply branding without puncture. It served sometimes as a mark of permanent ownership, as upon horses or cattle (Liddell and Scott, <span class="accented">sub verb.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>). In respect to slaves, it was not considered humane to brand them, except for punishment, or as security in particular cases against running away. Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, brandling, designated a scoundrel or a runaway slave; as Aristophanes, 'Lys.,' 331; 'Av.,' 760. Others besides slaves were sometimes branded in ignominious punishment: Aristophanes, 'Ran.,' 1507; Herod., 7:233. Thus we have in &AElig;schines (38, 26), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a branded deserter." Vegetius (quoted by Facciolati, <span class="accented">sub verb. stigma</span>), writing three hundred years later, states ('Do Re Milit.,' 1:8; 2:5) that, in the Roman army, raw recruits had to be proved fit for service before they were allowed to have the tattoo put upon them. After due trial, they were "punc-turis in cute punctis milites scripti et matriculis inserti." But this testimony does not establish the fact of such usage prevailing in the Roman army in St. Paul's time; though it is quite supposable that then, as now, soldiers might sometimes tattoo on their arm or hand the name of a favourite general. Instances are cited of consecration to a particular god being signalized by <span class="accented">stigma.</span> Herodotus, writing five hundred years before, says of a certain temple of Heracles, on the Egyptian coast, that if a servant, belonging to any man whatever, took sanctuary in it, and put upon himself sacred <span class="accented">stigmata</span>, giving himself to the god, no one could touch him (2:113). In 3Macc. 2:29 mention is made of a "mark of Dionysus" ivy leaf being, by means of fire, put upon the body of Jews in Egypt in the time of Ptolemy Philopator; but this would seem to have been intended rather as a barbarous indignity, because especially abhorrent to their religious feelings, than as an actual consecration of them to Dionysus as his "<span class="accented">slaves."</span> But that it was in some cases employed to signalize a "sacred slave" is attested by Philo, 'De Mon.,' 2. p. 221, M; and Lucian, 'De Dea Syr.,' &sect; 59, as cited by Bishop Lightfoot, who remarks that "<span class="accented">such</span> a practice could not have been unknown in a country which was the home of the worship of Cybele." An example more familiar to the apostle's mind might, perhaps, be cited from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a> (Septuagint), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;</span>, "shall write upon his hand, I am God's," which rendering Gesenius ('Thes.,' in <span class="accented">verb. kathabh</span>) consents to accept. But if this rendering be the right one, it may yet be doubted whether it means writing by puncture; for <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> appear in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a> to be forbidden; unless, indeed, the prohibition be taken to refer to idolatrous tattoos only. But even thus the use of such in idol-worships has a further confirmation. It appears, however, to be a strong objection to our supposing the apostle to be here alluding to either the <span class="accented">stigmata</span> of consecration or those of other ownership, that such would infer no more <span class="accented">suffering</span> than would attend simple tattooing; whereas it is plain that the apostle alludes to marks which evidenced the undergoing of inflictions of extraordinary severity. The word <span class="accented">stigma</span> had passed into Roman usage, being employed both in a literal sense and also in a figurative one of a "stigma," as we also speak, cast upon a person's character as by a poet's lampoon. Thus Martial ('Epigr.,' 12:62) writes, "Frons haec stigmate non meo notanda," "This forehead to be marked with a stigma not of my affixing," where the word <span class="accented">frons</span> indicates a close adherence to the original notion of a slave's forehead branded. Suetonius ('Caes.,' 73), "Catullum, a quo sibi versiculis de Mamurra perpetua stigmata imposita non dissimulaverat, satisfacientem eodem die adhibnit coenae." Reviewing the evidence now adduced as to the manner in which the term was used, we observe that the words "brandling" and "branded" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) were used to describe a person made infamous to open view by brand-marks put upon his person. It was natural that the word <span class="accented">stigma</span> would thus acquire the sense of a mark of patent infamy left upon a man's person by some corporal abuse which he had been subjected to, without any other qualifying idea. Now, it appears most probable that it is in this sense that the apostle here uses the word. The term points to those scars, seams, perhaps long-continuing sores, which the long course of ever-recurring hardships and ill usage, through which he had passed, must have left upon him - patent evidence to all who looked upon him of the manner in which his fellow-men regarded and treated him; this only, apart from any qualifying idea, whether of ownership, or of military allegiance, or of religious consecration. It is in this general sense that Chrysostom appears to have read the clause; and this general sense satisfies all the requirements of the context. A strong light is thrown upon this matter by what the apostle, near about this same time, wrote to the Corinthians, in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_corinthians/11-22.htm">2 Corinthians 11:22-27</a>. The passage, as indeed does the whole Epistle, with much also of the frmer Epistle addressed to the same Church, betokens a strong feeling at this particular time resting on his mind, of the grievous, countless, hardships which marked his career - a feeling, very supposably, just then freshened by some very painful experiences recently gone through, from the effects of which his bodily form was still suffering. "In stripes above measure,... in deaths oft. Of the Jews, five times received I forty stripes save one; thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep." Such are some particulars which he specifies; and the enumeration is very suggestive with reference to our present point. Could he have undergone that "stoning" at Lystra, after which he was dragged out of the city as dead to be left to lie without burial, and have carried away no enduring disfigurement? Whether any marks would be likely to remain upon him from the five Jewish whippings, we cannot tell; but we may be assured that the three floggings inflicted with the cruel <span class="accented">vitis</span> of the Roman soldiery must have scarred his flesh with seams of permanent disfigurement. Perhaps while he wrote, sores remaining from some one of those eight punishments were making themselves painfully felt. These judicial inflictions, however, severe as some of them may have been, were nevertheless regulated by law and custom. There were m all probability other, much more barbarous and altogether unregulated, violences, which came often upon him from the brutality of mobs, from the assaults of "robbers," from accidents in shipwreck. It could not fail but that his person presented, wherever he went, conspicuously to view, tokens that he was one wont to be both regarded and dealt with as if he were, no doubt deservedly, a wretched outcast; in his own forcible, most deeply pathetic phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> "as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-13.htm">1 Corinthians 4:13</a>). The apostle's enemies taunted him with the contrast which subsisted between the solemnity and power - would-be power they meant - of his letters, and the meanness and feebleness of his personal appearance and his personal address (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1, 10</a>). His personal presence may, originally and by natural make, not have been calculated to bespeak respect. But whatever disadvantages he lay under originally, must, beyond all question, have been vastly aggravated by the bodily hard ships to which he had been subjected. These must have left effects (this, perhaps, being the "stake in the flesh" which be groaned under - "Satan's messenger to buffet him," the fruits, certainly, of Satan's working in the hearts of godless men) which he felt to be not only fraught with personal humiliation in whatever intercourse he held with his fellow-men, but also likely greatly to mar his efficiency in his ministerial work. The only consolation remaining to him was that, in the utter extinction of all self-love, he rejoiced to know that Christ's grace had, in this enhanced feebleness of his instrument, the clearer field wherein to manifest its own Divine potency (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>). "The flesh-marks of Jesus." This may be understood as meaning that they were incurred in Jesus' service. In part it may be so taken; but the relation expressed by this genitive appears to go deeper than that. The apostle means, the marks which disfigured the body of Jesus as now reproduced in <span class="accented">his</span> body. The genitive is used in just the same way as it is in the strikingly similar clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>, "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), where ' <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> means apparently "the deadness <span class="accented">or</span> corpse-condition of Jesus" (compare the use of the Greek noun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a>); the state of Jesus' <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, while yet hanging a corpse on the cross. By s strong hyperbole, prompted by the intense feeling then on his mind of his own bodily sufferings and the almost ever-present imminency of death (comp. vers. 7-12 of the same chapter), the apostle, in those words, refers to "Jesus' corpse-condition" as reproduced in his own bodily condition, adding the expression of his assured conviction that all was to this end - that "the life also of Jesus," that is, the life which Jesus himself lives, should be all the more clearly manifested by what he was working in the world, in and through a body apparently so death-bound as the apostle's was. The use of the phrase, thus interpreted, coheres well with the feeling which, in the writing of this Epistle, was very near to his soul, of his being "crucified along with Christ." The phrase, then, glances at those swollen, livid, blood-flecked, wales and bruises (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>:) which the Roman scourging that immediately preceded his being handed over for crucifixion must have left on his sacred flesh - no part spared - the entire frame pervaded alike with disfigurement and with torture. To the body of his adorable Lord at that hour - to the human consciousness of every thoughtful spectator, defaced, shorn by the dis-honouring whip of the dignity properly connate with a human body, and made utterly vile (for this should seem to have been the symbolical meaning and intent of that customary preliminary of crucifixion) - and, at length on the cross, presenting to open view those brand-marks of degradedness, the apostle feels his own body to be, in the treatment it had received and the condition to which it had been reduced, in no small measure assimilated. Not only was he in spirit joined unto his Lord and one spirit with him; but in body likewise was he (so to speak) joined unto his Lord, and one body with him; being deeply "taught" in the lesson of what was meant by being "a sharer of his sufferings, while day by day becoming more conformed to the fashion of <span class="accented">his</span> death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>); clothed with Christ in this sense also; clothed with the Crucified One. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, as here introduced, may be distinguished from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>, by presenting the notion of one's carrying something in thought separable from one's self, instead of being (so to speak) commingled with one's own being. "<span class="accented">I</span> am carrying, and can offer to your view, the brand-marks of Jesus." Chrysostom catches this view, perhaps carrying it out somewhat far, in his animated comment, "He saith not, 'I have,' but I carry;' like a man priding himself on a trophy and ensigns of a king." The use of the same verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, "to bear my Name before the Gentiles and kings," clearly illustrates its import here. This closing verse is withal no piteous appeal for commiserating sympathy. The tone of "from henceforth," betokening the feeling of one who has made up his mind not to be trifled with, precludes the notion of his mood being one of mere self-pity and tenderness. Far more does the apostle hereby make claim to share with his Lord in that mingled sentiment of reverence and deferential, sympathetic compliance, which the disciple of Christ might be expected to entertain towards his Lord, crucified for him; such a sentiment as would prompt him to lighten, if he might, <span class="accented">his</span> burden and pain, to take part in <span class="accented">his</span> enterprise, to help forward <span class="accented">his</span> designs. Those brand-marks would cry out in loud protest against a <span class="accented">fellow-disciple's</span> antipathy, tergiversation, or disesteem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:16-18 A new creation to the image of Christ, as showing faith in him, is the greatest distinction between one man and another, and a blessing is declared on all who walk according to this rule. The blessings are, peace and mercy. Peace with God and our conscience, and all the comforts of this life, as far as they are needful. And mercy, an interest in the free love and favour of God in Christ, the spring and fountain of all other blessings. The written word of God is the rule we are to go by, both in its doctrines and precepts. May his grace ever be with our spirit, to sanctify, quicken, and cheer us, and may we always be ready to maintain the honour of that which is indeed our life. The apostle had in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus, the scars of wounds from persecuting enemies, for his cleaving to Christ, and the doctrine of the gospel. The apostle calls the Galatians his brethren, therein he shows his humility and his tender affection for them; and he takes his leave with a very serious prayer, that they might enjoy the favour of Christ Jesus, both in its effects and in its evidences. We need desire no more to make us happy than the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. The apostle does not pray that the law of Moses, or the righteousness of works, but that the grace of Christ, might be with them; that it might be in their hearts and with their spirits, quickening, comforting, and strengthening them: to all which he sets his Amen; signifying his desire that so it might be, and his faith that so it would be.</body></html>
