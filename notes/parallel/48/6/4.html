Let a man judge his own work, not by comparison with others, but by the ideal standard, then he will see what it is worth and how much he has to boast of. His boasting will be at least real, and not based upon any delusive comparisons. He must stand or fall by himself. He must bear the weight of his own virtues and his own sins. By them he will be judged, and not by any fancied superiority or inferiority to others. For the thought, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.">2Corinthians 10:12-14</a>.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Prove.</span>--<span class= "ital">Test,</span> or <span class= "ital">examine,</span> by reference to an objective standard.

This notion of practical self-improving attaches to the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> ("prove" or" examine") also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone</span> <span class="cmt_word">(</span><span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">and then in regard to himself alone shall he have whereof to glory.</span> The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; "What didst thou look at that thou didst doubt?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-25.htm">Acts 2:25</a>, "concerning him;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-19.htm">Romans 16:19</a>. It depends upon the whole phrase, "shall have his ground of glorying," and not upon the word rendered "ground of glorying" alone. The distinction which ordinarily obtains between verbals of the form of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and those of the form of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> appears to hold good also in respect to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Compare the use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-16.htm">James 4:16</a>, with that of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-2.htm">Romans 4:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "hath whereof to glory;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "I have nothing to glory of." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the substantive seems to mean "boast," that is, what is said in boasting, as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the action of uttering a beast. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, with its derivatives - a favourite term with St. Paul - often appears to mean "rejoicing" rather than" boasting" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>); but it seems desirable as a rule to render it by "glorying," with the understanding that the writer has frequently the joyous state of feeling more prominently in his view than the utterance of self-gratulation. What the apostle meant by "having one's ground of glorying in regard to one's own self alone," is well illustrated by what he says respecting himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>, "Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward." he had been himself in the habit of testing his conduct and spirit by the standard of Christ's law; and this was the fruit. <span class="cmt_word">And not in another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">and not in regard to that neighbour of his.</span> The article probably points to that neighbour with whom he has been comparing himself; and so, perhaps, also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a>. But it may be simply "his neighbour;" "the man who is other than himself;" as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1</a> and 1 Cor 10:24, in neither of which passages has any particular "other person" been before referred to. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 We are to bear one another's burdens. So we shall fulfil the law of Christ. This obliges to mutual forbearance and compassion towards each other, agreeably to his example. It becomes us to bear one another's burdens, as fellow-travellers. It is very common for a man to look upon himself as wiser and better than other men, and as fit to dictate to them. Such a one deceives himself; by pretending to what he has not, he puts a cheat upon himself, and sooner or later will find the sad effects. This will never gain esteem, either with God or men. Every one is advised to prove his own work. The better we know our own hearts and ways, the less shall we despise others, and the more be disposed to help them under infirmities and afflictions. How light soever men's sins seem to them when committed, yet they will be found a heavy burden, when they come to reckon with God about them. No man can pay a ransom for his brother; and sin is a burden to the soul. It is a spiritual burden; and the less a man feels it to be such, the more cause has he to suspect himself. Most men are dead in their sins, and therefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin. Feeling the weight and burden of our sins, we must seek to be eased thereof by the Saviour, and be warned against every sin.</body></html>
