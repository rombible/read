The distinction would be sufficiently represented if we were to translate in the one case <span class= "ital">burden,</span> in the other <span class= "ital">load.</span> The context, however, is quite different. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm" title="Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.">Galatians 6:2</a> the Christian is bidden to "bear the burdens" of others, in the sense of sympathising with them in their troubles. Here he is told that he must "bear his own load," in the sense that he must answer directly to God for his own actions. His responsibility cannot be shifted on to others. It will make him no better that there are others worse than himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For every man shall bear his</span> <span class="cmt_word">own burden</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">for each man shall carry his own pack.</span> A man's business is with his own pack; and all depends upon his carrying <span class="accented">that</span>, not putting it down. This "pack" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is the whole of the duties for the discharge of which each man is responsible. It is thus that the image is employed by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>), "My yoke is easy, and my pack is light." So also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>, "For they tie up packs heavy and hard to carry, and lay them upon men's shoulders." The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "the pack which is individually his own," implies that men's responsibilities vary, each one having such as are peculiar to himself. This "pack" is to be carefully distinguished from the "heavy loads" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>) of ver. 2, Our Christian obligations Christ makes, to them who serve him well, <span class="accented">light</span>; but our burdens of remorse, shame, grief, loss, which are of our own wilful procuring, these may be, must needs be, <span class="accented">heavy.</span> One part of our "pack" of obligation is to help each other in bearing these "heavy loads;" and we shall find our joy and crown of glorying in doing so; not only in the approval of our own consciences and in the consciousness of Christ's approval, but also in the manifold refreshments of mutual Christian sympathy. On the other hand, our Christian responsibilities, including these of mutual sympathy and succour, we must not attempt to evade. One man is able to do more for others than another man can; the truly "spiritual" man, for example, can do that which others may not even attempt to touch: each one has his own part and duty. And Christ's <span class="accented">mot d'ordre</span> to all his workmen, or possibly the apostle means to all his soldiers, is this: "Every man carry his own pack!" The future tense of the verb "shall carry" does not point to some future time, but to the absoluteness of the law for all time; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a> (see Winer, 'Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 40, p. 251, 6th edit.). The varying turn given to the same general image of carrying burdens in ver. 2 and here is quite in St. Paul's manner. Compare, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>. the varying turn given to the images of "epistle" and "veil." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 We are to bear one another's burdens. So we shall fulfil the law of Christ. This obliges to mutual forbearance and compassion towards each other, agreeably to his example. It becomes us to bear one another's burdens, as fellow-travellers. It is very common for a man to look upon himself as wiser and better than other men, and as fit to dictate to them. Such a one deceives himself; by pretending to what he has not, he puts a cheat upon himself, and sooner or later will find the sad effects. This will never gain esteem, either with God or men. Every one is advised to prove his own work. The better we know our own hearts and ways, the less shall we despise others, and the more be disposed to help them under infirmities and afflictions. How light soever men's sins seem to them when committed, yet they will be found a heavy burden, when they come to reckon with God about them. No man can pay a ransom for his brother; and sin is a burden to the soul. It is a spiritual burden; and the less a man feels it to be such, the more cause has he to suspect himself. Most men are dead in their sins, and therefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin. Feeling the weight and burden of our sins, we must seek to be eased thereof by the Saviour, and be warned against every sin.</body></html>
