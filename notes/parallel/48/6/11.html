These Judaising teachers only wish to have you circumcised as a matter of outside show, in order to disguise their own professed Christianity from their fellow Jews, and so escape persecution. They show that they really care nothing for circumcision, for they freely break the rest of the Law to which they affect to give in their adhesion. Their true object is to make capital out of their influence over you, to boast publicly of your submission to the rite. I, too, will boast, but of something very different. My boast is in the cross of Christ. When I attached myself to the crucified Messiah, from that moment the world became nothing to me. Circumcision and uncircumcision matter not. The essential point is that total change which such a relation implies. On all who take this for their rule I can invoke a blessing, for they are the true Israel. Enough. I have a right to claim exemption from these attacks. The scars that I bear upon me are marks of the place I hold in my Master's service.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Ye</span> <span class= "bld">see.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">See.</span> The Apostle calls the attention of his readers to the handwriting of these concluding paragraphs.<p><span class= "bld">How large a letter.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in what large letters: i.e.,</span> characters. The exact significance of these words is somewhat enigmatic, and can only be matter of conjecture. Two points, however, are clear:--(1) The latter part of the Greek phrase means "in" or "with" letters--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> characters of hand-writing--and not "a letter," "an epistle," as it is taken in the Authorised version; (2) The former half of the phrase means "how large," strictly in respect of size. The Apostle, for some reason or other, points out that the characters in which he is writing are larger than usual. What is his reason? It is hard to say. Some have thought that the reference was to the "shapelessness" of the letters, whether as due to the fact that the Apostle himself was not accustomed to the manual work of writing, or possibly to physical weakness from the hardships that he had undergone. The idea of "shapelessness," however, is not necessarily included in that of size. It seems, on the whole, most probable that the size of the characters express the emphasis and authority with which the Apostle is writing. He adds to the Epistle--which had so far been written by an amanuensis--a few bold incisive strokes in his own hand, trenchantly exposing the motives of the Judaising faction, and re-asserting his own position.<p><span class= "bld">I have written.</span>--Must this be so taken: <span class= "ital">I have written?</span> or may it be idiomatically translated: <span class= "ital">I write?</span> In other words, does it refer to the whole previous portion of the Epistle, or only to these concluding paragraphs? The question turns upon a nice point of Greek scholarship, on which such authorities as Bishop Ellicott and Dr. Lightfoot take different sides. It will only be possible in a Commentary like this to express a general conclusion, without going into the arguments on which it is based. That conclusion would be that the Greek may, quite fairly and tenably, be translated: <span class= "ital">I write;</span> and that being so, considerations of exegesis would seem to tell somewhat decidedly in the same direction. The whole character of this concluding section is very much what we should expect if St. Paul followed his usual custom of taking the pen from the amanuensis to write it, and its brief weighty summarising style would correspond well with the "largo letters" in which he says that it was written. If this description is to be applied to the whole Epistle, it must remain a riddle to which there is no clue.<p><span class= "bld">With mine own hand.</span>--It was the Apostle's custom to make use of an amanuensis, and only to add a few final words in proof of the genuineness of the writing.

Each one of the four next Greek words, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>, has been subjected to a variety of interprerations. What appears to the present writer the most probable view he must explain as briefly as he is able. The interrogative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means "how great," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-2.htm">Zechariah 2:2</a> (Septuagint); <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-4.htm">Hebrews 7:4</a>. Accordingly, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> in Polyb., 1:2, 8 (cited in Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon') means "how many and how large." Many, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Chrysostom, have supposed that the word includes a reference to clumsiness, ungainliness, as attaching to the apostle's handwriting ("with what big letters!'). But no example of the word being used in this sense of "ungainliness" has been adduced; and it seems safer not to import into its rendering this additional shade of meaning. The dative <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> Bishop Lightfoot proposes to connect closely with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> are often used in familiar style, with the sense <span class="accented">mark you</span>! But there is no instance of this use of the dative pronoun in the Greek Testament (see Winer, 'Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 22, 7, Anna. 2, p. 140); and here surely it more naturally connects itself with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span>. It is not uncommon with St. Paul to insert some word or words between a substantive and its adjective or dependent genitive, as here between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15</a>, etc.). In the instances now cited there appears no more logical occasion for such a seeming disarrangement of the words than there does here. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> is used with no objective accusative following, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>; the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> being in the dative, because the apostle is referring merely to the <span class="accented">form</span> of the medium of communication, and not to the substance of the communication itself. The rendering of the Authorized Version, "how large a letter I have written," cannot be defended as a literal translation, though it may be allowed on one view of the passage to give the sense rightly. But though the plural noun <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, in ordinary Greek, like <span class="accented">literae</span> in Latin, sometimes occurs in the sense of a single epistle or letter, it is never so used by St. Paul, who always employs the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> to express this notion, which he does no less than seventeen times. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-21.htm">Acts 28:21</a> it is rendered "letters," in the plural number; being properly "communications in writing." The noun <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> was the word ordinarily employed in Greek to designate a letter of the alphabet. It also denotes "a writing," as when in the plural we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>, "if ye believe not his writings," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>," the sacred writings," or Scriptures. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-6.htm">Luke 16:6, 7</a> "take thy bill" is literally, "take thy writings" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> being the now accepted reading in the Greek text). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>, "the ministration of death in writings," the word probably refers to the ten commandments, each forming one writing; though it <span class="accented">may</span> mean "in characters of writing." In ordinary Greek it sometimes denotes a passage of a treatise or book (Liddell and Scott, under the word, 2:4). Next <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> ("I have written") may be understood, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>, "I have written the more boldly unto you," etc., with reference to the entire letter, now nearly complete, as it lies before him. In that case the apostle's words may be rendered, "See, with what long writings [or, 'pieces of writing'] I have written unto you with mine own hand." Through some cause or other, we know not what the cause was, writing with his own hand was not a welcome employment to him; so far unwelcome that he generally devolved the actual penning of his letters upon an amanuensis, merely authenticating each letter as his own by a postscript added in his own hand (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3</a>. <span class="accented">fin</span>.). Perhaps Philemon forms the only' exception (see ver. 19), apart from this letter to the Galatians. We may, therefore, imagine the apostle as painfully and laboriously penning one portion after another of the Epistle; often pausing weariedly in the work as he came to the end of each <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, that is, to the end of each section of his argument, each seeming to him a long and toilsome effort. And now at last he exclaims," Look, what long, laborious performances of handwriting I have achieved in writing to you! And from that learn how deeply I am concerned on your behalf, and how grave your present spiritual peril appears to me to be!" Ordinarily it was only a brief "piece of writing" that he wrote with his own hand; here, long pieces, added one after another with painful effort. Or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the verb "I have written" may be referred to what the apostle is now beginning to pen, not merely because the epistolary style of the ancients, Greek and Roman, was wont to place the writer of a letter in the temporal standing-point of its recipient, as when Cicero dates his letters <span class="accented">scribebam Id</span>., etc., but because under some circumstances it is natural that the writer should thus refer himself to the view of his correspondent. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a>, "I Paul have written it (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>) with mine own hand, I will repay it." It would be quite obvious to ourselves to express our meaning in the same manner. So far, then, as such considerations reach, it appears quite supposable that the apostle, having employed an amanuensis as usual as far as the end of ver. 10, then himself took up the pen for the customary addition of an authenticating postscript; and that, for the purpose of adding especial emphasis to the postscript which he here thought advisable to add, he made his handwriting most unusually large, and that it is to this emphatic style of penmanship that he here draws attention. Many modern critics have acquiesced in this explanation; and if <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "<span class="accented">letters</span>," that is, characters of the writing, it seems the most probable; for it does not seem likely that the whole Epistle was written in letters of an extraordinary size; while, if the characters were those of his ordinary style of penmanship, the remark would be too trivial to come from him. The present writer inclines to the former method of interpretation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Many excuse themselves from the work of religion, though they may make a show, and profess it. They may impose upon others, yet they deceive themselves if they think to impose upon God, who knows their hearts as well as actions; and as he cannot be deceived, so he will not be mocked. Our present time is seed time; in the other world we shall reap as we sow now. As there are two sorts of sowing, one to the flesh, and the other to the Spirit, so will the reckoning be hereafter. Those who live a carnal, sensual life, must expect no other fruit from such a course than misery and ruin. But those who, under the guidance and influences of the Holy Spirit, live a life of faith in Christ, and abound in Christian graces, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. We are all very apt to tire in duty, particularly in doing good. This we should carefully watch and guard against. Only to perseverance in well-doing is the reward promised. Here is an exhortation to all to do good in their places. We should take care to do good in our life-time, and make this the business of our lives. Especially when fresh occasions offer, and as far as our power reaches.</body></html>
