The reading of the Textus Receptus, followed in our Authorized Version, is this: <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. But by almost all recent editors this reading is replaced by the one given above. That <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the true reading, and not <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, all are agreed in thinking; <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> being regarded as a correction imported from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>. The evidence for the rejection of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which is found in all the uncial manuscripts except the Vatican, is by no means equally decisive. The presence of those words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>, where they are very suitable to the context, has with great probability been supposed to explain their being also found here, being introduced, like <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> from the former passage, by the copyists; but here the qualification made by them is not so certainly required. The apostle felt it to be not merely true <span class="accented">relatively</span>, that is, for those "in Christ Jesus," but, since Christ died on a cross, true <span class="accented">absolutely</span>, that for salvation neither circumcision was aught, nor uncircumcision, but only a new creature. For the discussion of the terms of the aphorism as here stated, as compared with its form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm">1 Corinthians 7:19</a>, the reader is referred to the notes on Galatians 5:6. The words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> may mean either "a new creature," or "a new act of creation making a man a new creature." It is hardly admissible to take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> as "creation" in a collective sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>; though this <span class="accented">may</span>, perhaps, be its meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, "If any man is in Christ, there is a new creation," that is (perhaps), he finds himself, as it were, in a new heaven and a new earth. Christians as such are elsewhere described by the apostle as the product of God's creative hand; thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, "For we are his workmanship (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), created (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) in Christ Jesus for good works." As "begotten again" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), or "born anew" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), subjects of a "regeneration" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>), they must, of course, be the products of a new act of creation. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-18</a> the sentence, "If any man is in Christ, there is a new creation," or "he is a new creature," lies embedded in a passage which describes in language of remarkable intenseness the transforming influence of Christ's death, wherever by faith it has been fully grasped. That passage, occurring as it does in an Epistle written nearly at the same time as the Epistle to the Galatians, leaves no doubt as to the ideas which in the apostle's mind cluster round the term" new creation," mentioned, here too as in effect there, in close connection with the cross of Christ, his sole supreme glory. It points to the state of a sinner consciously reconciled to God by the death of Christ, and finding himself thus translated into the midst of new perceptions, new joys, new habits of life. new expectations. "The old things are passed away" - guilt, the overmastering power of sin, laborious effort after goodness frustrated after all and ineffectual, the servile routine of a dead unquickening ceremonialism: "behold, all things are become new, and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself through Christ." The phrase, "a new creature," appears to have been used by the Jews to describe the change resulting in the case of a heathen becoming a proselyte. <span class="accented">That</span> was no doubt a great change; but far greater seemed to the apostle to be the transformation in the case of one translated from the bondage and darkness of the "letter" into the "newness of the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>). lie had himself experienced how marvellously great as well as how blessed the transition was; and he has described it in glowing terms also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-2:10</a>. In the present passage the particle "for" seems to point back, not exclusively to ver. 14, but to the general tenor of the whole passage in vers. 12-14, as rebuking that great ado about circumcision which the innovators referred to were making in the Galatian Churches, thereby diverting the minds of those that listened to them from the Christian's true business. This sense of the particle may seem somewhat loose; but it suits well the rapid, decisive, summarizing strain with which the apostle is now closing up his letter. The supreme concern, he means, for every one who wishes to be a member of God's kingdom is that he shall realize in his own experience the "new creation;" alike in the freedom and joy of adoption which appertains thereto (ch. 4.), and also in that walking of the Spirit which includes the crucifixion of the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>). On this point we may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23, 21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:12-15 Proud, vain, and carnal hearts, are content with just so much religion as will help to keep up a fair show. But the apostle professes his own faith, hope, and joy; and that his principal glory was in the cross of Christ. By which is here meant, his sufferings and death on the cross, the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Redeemer. By Christ, or by the cross of Christ, the world is crucified to the believer, and he to the world. The more we consider the sufferings of the Redeemer from the world, the less likely shall we be to love the world. The apostle was as little affected by its charms, as a beholder would be by any thing which had been graceful in the face of a crucified person, when he beholds it blackened in the agonies of death. He was no more affected by the objects around him, than one who is expiring would be struck with any of the prospects his dying eyes might view from the cross on which he hung. And as to those who have truly believed in Christ Jesus, all things are counted as utterly worthless compared with him. There is a new creation; old things are passed away, and new views and dispositions are brought in under the regenerating influences of God the Holy Spirit. Believers are brought into a new world, and being created in Christ Jesus unto good works, are formed to a life of holiness. It is a change of mind and heart, whereby we are enabled to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to live to God; and where this inward, practical religion is wanting, outward professions, or names, will never stand in any stead.</body></html>
