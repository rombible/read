Such seems to be the swaying of thought in the sentence; hence the position of the participial phrase before the verb: the participle is not a mere qualification of the verb, as it is in the rendering, "Let us not be weary in well-doing," and as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; but, with an implied exhortation that such should be the case, it supposes that we are of the better class, and founds upon the supposition the exhortation not to flag. "That which is commendable (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" recites, not works of beneficence only, but every species of moral excellence, comprising in brief the enumeration given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, all of which is included in "sowing unto the Spirit," The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in five other places of the New Testament - <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm">Ephesians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a>. In every one of these six passages some of the manuscripts present the variant reading of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which in all is adopted in the Textus Receptus, but is in all replaced with the general consent of recent editors by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. It is, indeed, questioned whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is ever used by any Greek author. The difference in meaning is material: <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is to be bad in doing a thing; while <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, would probably mean to be so bad at a course of action as to leave it <span class="accented">off</span> altogether. In the first four of the above-cited passages it is tendered in the Authorized Version by "faint;" whilst in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a> and here it is rendered "be weary," that is, "flag." In all the notion of flagging appears the most suitable, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1, 16</a> necessary. In the present passage the course of thought requires us to understand it as not so strong a word as <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Critics point attention to the play of phrase in connecting the expression, doing that which is <span class="accented">commendable</span> or good, with the verb denoting being <span class="accented">bad</span> at doing it. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. The epigrammatic combination would seem to have been a favourite one with St. Paul, occurring as it does in two letters written several years apart. Such playfulness is not foreign to his style. The use of the first person plural <span class="accented">may</span> be merely cohortative, as above in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>. But it may also he a real self-exhortation as well. In the long, long, weary, arduous conflict which St. Paul was waging throughout his Christian career, the flesh must often have felt weak, and have required the application of this goad. And this tone of personal feeling may, perhaps, be further discerned in the use of the phrase, "in due season;" the blessed reaping of joy may seem to us at times long in coming; but God's time for its coming will be the best time; let us, therefore, be resigned to wait for that. This seems to be the tone of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "in its own times," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For in due season we shall reap, if we faint</span> <span class="cmt_word">not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)<span class="accented">. for at its own season we shall reap</span>, <span class="accented">if we faint not.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the season assigned to an event in the counsels of God; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span>, "in his season," of the revelation of the "man of lawlessness." <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a> with reference, as here, to the day of judgment; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-3.htm">Titus 1:3</a>, of the manifestation of the gospel. In every case the phrase appears to intimate that the season appointed by God, though not what man might have anticipated or wished, was, however, to be acquiesced in as wisest and best (see last note). The reaping is the same as that referred to in the previous two verses. "If we faint not." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-2.htm">Mark 8:2</a> is to faint physically from exhaustion. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3, 5</a> it is used of succumbing, giving in, morally; not merely feeling weak, but in consequence of weakness giving up all further effort. In this latter sense it occurs in the Septuagint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-3.htm">Joshua 18:3</a> and in 1 Macc. 9:8. And this last is its meaning here. It expresses more than the flagging of spirit before mentioned; for that would not forfeit the reward of past achievement, unless it led to the actual relinquishment of further endeavour; this last would forfeit it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-8.htm">2 John 1:8</a>). Taking it thus, there is no occasion for understanding this phrase, "not fainting," as several of the Greek commentators do, including apparently Chrysostom, as if it meant thus: "We shall reap without any fear of fainting or becoming weary any more;" which surely, as Alford observes, gives a vapid turn to the sentence. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Many excuse themselves from the work of religion, though they may make a show, and profess it. They may impose upon others, yet they deceive themselves if they think to impose upon God, who knows their hearts as well as actions; and as he cannot be deceived, so he will not be mocked. Our present time is seed time; in the other world we shall reap as we sow now. As there are two sorts of sowing, one to the flesh, and the other to the Spirit, so will the reckoning be hereafter. Those who live a carnal, sensual life, must expect no other fruit from such a course than misery and ruin. But those who, under the guidance and influences of the Holy Spirit, live a life of faith in Christ, and abound in Christian graces, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. We are all very apt to tire in duty, particularly in doing good. This we should carefully watch and guard against. Only to perseverance in well-doing is the reward promised. Here is an exhortation to all to do good in their places. We should take care to do good in our life-time, and make this the business of our lives. Especially when fresh occasions offer, and as far as our power reaches.</body></html>
