The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, eat up, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-20.htm">2 Corinthians 11:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a> is applied to the eating up of a neighbour's goods, is here employed in its more literal sense, in order to furnish a figure describing that intense desire to vex and damage an antagonist, which but too often disgraces the so-called religious controversialist or partisan. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, utterly destroy, occurs besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, of destruction by fire or lightning; so the compound <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>. It points to another sphere of hurt than that referred to in the two foregoing verbs; for while these latter describe the eager endeavour to sting and "run down" a theological opponent, the former describes the utter laying waste of the inward life of piety. The orthodox opinion may survive, and perhaps be even made clearer and more accurate; but the kernel of filial love and joy in God, and of love towards our brethren, may by the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the bitter antagonism, of controversy have got to be altogether eaten out. A Christian disciple who has ceased to love, Christ teaches us, is salt which has lost its savour - utterly refuse and hopeless of recovery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-50.htm">Mark 9:50</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:13-15 The gospel is a doctrine according to godliness, 1Ti 6:3, and is so far from giving the least countenance to sin, that it lays us under the strongest obligation to avoid and subdue it. The apostle urges that all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. If Christians, who should help one another, and rejoice one another, quarrel, what can be expected but that the God of love should deny his grace, that the Spirit of love should depart, and the evil spirit, who seeks their destruction, should prevail? Happy would it be, if Christians, instead of biting and devouring one another on account of different opinions, would set themselves against sin in themselves, and in the places where they live.</body></html>
