These belong properly to the third group, and should have been placed in the same verse with them. We have the like alliterative combination of the Greek words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Judging from the evidence of manuscripts, the genuineness of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, is extremely doubtful. Regard being had to the particular circumstances of the Galatian Churches, which the apostle no doubt had in his eye in this enumeration, "murders' seems too strong a word to be appropriate; and this consideration seems to prove the word here not authentic. <span class="cmt_word">Drunkenness, revellings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">drunkennesses</span>, <span class="accented">revellings.</span> We have the same two plural nouns in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. This fourth group represents sins of excess. Here, too, the apostle touches a form of vice, to which abundant testimony shows the Galatians, as well as other branches of Celts, to have been especially prone. It was, perhaps, this marked feature of the Galatian nationality in particular that led St. Peter, in addressing the Churches of "Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia," to speak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-3.htm">1 Peter 4:3</a>) of their having formerly walked in "lasciviousness, lusts, wine-bibbings, revellings, carousings (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and abominable idolatries." <span class="cmt_word">And such like</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and those</span> (works) <span class="accented">which arc like to these. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">of the which I forewarn you</span>, <span class="accented">even as I did forewarn you.</span> The construction of the accusative <span class="greek">&#x1f05;</span> is precisely similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-54.htm">John 8:54</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>.

"As I did forewarn you;" this previous warning was probably given at his very first preaching of the gospel to them he would no doubt at once speak plainly to people, very commonly sunk in vice and excess, of the awards of the "judgment to come." <span class="cmt_word">That they which do such things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>): <span class="accented">that they which practise such things.</span> The present tense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is more suitable than the aorist, as being the language of warning with reference to future conduct (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-2.htm">Romans 2:2, 3, 7-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall not inherit the kingdom of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The apostle uses the same words in writing to the Corinthians with reference to the sins to which they were the most prone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>). So <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>, "No fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God." This "kingdom" is also referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>, "Walk worthily of God who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory" ("His own!" Astonishing prospect!); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a>, "That ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>, "will save me unto his heavenly kingdom." The like designation of the future felicity is given by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm">2 Peter 1:11</a>), "entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ," and by St. James (it. 5), "heirs of the kingdom which he [God] promised to them that love him." It is derived from our Lord's own teaching, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>, "Inherit the kingdom prepared for you;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>, "It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." It is the manifestation and consummation of "that kingdom of heaven," or "kingdom of God," heralded by Christ and his forerunner as "at hand," which the Prophet Daniel had pointed forward to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14, 18</a>). Bondage to "the flesh" in this life is constantly declared throughout the New Testament to form an insuperable bar to an entrance into that exalted state. And what is the alternative prospect? This the Apostle Paul does not here specify, though elsewhere he does so with awful emphasis; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:16-26 If it be our care to act under the guidance and power of the blessed Spirit, though we may not be freed from the stirrings and oppositions of the corrupt nature which remains in us, it shall not have dominion over us. Believers are engaged in a conflict, in which they earnestly desire that grace may obtain full and speedy victory. And those who desire thus to give themselves up to be led by the Holy Spirit, are not under the law as a covenant of works, nor exposed to its awful curse. Their hatred of sin, and desires after holiness, show that they have a part in the salvation of the gospel. The works of the flesh are many and manifest. And these sins will shut men out of heaven. Yet what numbers, calling themselves Christians, live in these, and say they hope for heaven! The fruits of the Spirit, or of the renewed nature, which we are to do, are named. And as the apostle had chiefly named works of the flesh, not only hurtful to men themselves, but tending to make them so to one another, so here he chiefly notices the fruits of the Spirit, which tend to make Christians agreeable one to another, as well as to make them happy. The fruits of the Spirit plainly show, that such are led by the Spirit. By describing the works of the flesh and fruits of the Spirit, we are told what to avoid and oppose, and what we are to cherish and cultivate; and this is the sincere care and endeavour of all real Christians. Sin does not now reign in their mortal bodies, so that they obey it, Ro 6:12, for they seek to destroy it. Christ never will own those who yield themselves up to be the servants of sin. And it is not enough that we cease to do evil, but we must learn to do well. Our conversation will always be answerable to the principle which guides and governs us, Ro 8:5. We must set ourselves in earnest to mortify the deeds of the body, and to walk in newness of life. Not being desirous of vain-glory, or unduly wishing for the esteem and applause of men, not provoking or envying one another, but seeking to bring forth more abundantly those good fruits, which are, through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God.</body></html>
