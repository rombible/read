We may group it with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, forgetfulness; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> (sparinguess), clemency; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, fulness, satiety; which are likewise verbal nouns formed from the perfect passive (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc.). And the comparison favours the conclusion that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> denotes the disposition, state, or habit of mind evinced in being persuaded in the way now thought cf. So the Greek commentators (Ecumenius and Theophylact understand it of their <span class="accented">having been persuaded</span> to Judaize. The explanation of the noun as an active verbal, as if it were the persuasion which was soliciting them from without, does not seem to be so well berne out by its etymological formation, but appears nevertheless to be that accepted by Chrysostom. This noun, seemingly not often used, appears to have been selected by the apostle to brand the belief in the truth of Judaizing views which the Galatians were imbibing as being in nature diverse from the positive faith, which realizes the truth of the gospel; it is the product of over-persuasion, of cozenage even, rather than an acceptance of the plain setting forth of the simple truth, while "faith" is "the gift of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5, 8</a>). <span class="accented">As</span> Chrysostom observes, ." It was not men's persuasion (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), but the power of God, which persuaded the souls of these who believe." By "him that calleth you" is plainly meant <span class="accented">God</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>). "The present participle is preferred here to the aorist, because the stress is laid on the <span class="accented">person</span> rather than the <span class="accented">act"</span> (Bishop Lightfoot). That persuasibleness of the Galatians was not from God; at the best it was from the world (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>); but was it not, rather, from Satan, whose emissaries those false teachers were (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>)? The apostle makes this assertion categorically, knowing it to be true. The gospel which he had brought to them had been sealed by the gifts of the Spirit accompanying its reception; while the doctrine they were now in danger of listening to was another thing altogether (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>) - a thing with an anathema upon it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-12 The life of a Christian is a race, wherein he must run, and hold on, if he would obtain the prize. It is not enough that we profess Christianity, but we must run well, by living up to that profession. Many who set out fairly in religion, are hindered in their progress, or turn out of the way. It concerns those who begin to turn out of the way, or to tire in it, seriously to inquire what hinders them. The opinion or persuasion, ver. 8, was, no doubt, that of mixing the works of the law with faith in Christ in justification. The apostle leaves them to judge whence it must arise, but sufficiently shows that it could be owing to none but Satan. It is dangerous for Christian churches to encourage those who follow, but especially who spread, destructive errors. And in reproving sin and error, we should always distinguish between the leaders and the led. The Jews were offended, because Christ was preached as the only salvation for sinners. If Paul and others would have admitted that the observance of the law of Moses was to be joined with faith in Christ, as necessary to salvation, then believers might have avoided many of the sufferings they underwent. The first beginnings of such leaven should be opposed. And assuredly those who persist in disturbing the church of Christ must bear their judgment.</body></html>
