If you accept the one you must give up the other. Circumcision is a pledge or engagement to live by the rule of the Law. That rule must be taken as a whole. You are committed to the practice of the whole Law, and in that way alone you must seek for justification. Our position is something quite different. We hope to be admitted into a state of righteousness through the action of the Spirit on God's side, and through faith on our own. The Christian owes the righteousness attributed to him, not to circumcision, but to a life of which faith is the motive and love the law.<p>The whole tenor of the Epistle shows that the Apostle viewed the attempts of the Judaising party with indignation; and at this point his language takes a more than usually stern and imperative tone. He speaks with the full weight of his apostolic authority, and warns the Galatians that no half-measures will avail, but that they must decide, once for all, either to give up Judaism or Christ.<p>This is one of the passages which have been insisted on as proving a direct antagonism between St. Paul and the other Apostles; but any one who enters into the thought of the Apostle, and follows the course of his impassioned reasoning, will see how unnecessary any such assumption is. Nothing is more in accordance with human nature than that the same man should at one time agree to the amicable compromise of Acts 15, and at another, some years later, with the field all to himself, and only his own converts to deal with, should allow freer scope to his own convictions. He is speaking with feelings highly roused, and with less regard to considerations of policy. Besides, the march of events had been rapid, and the principles of policy themselves would naturally change.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">Behold, I Paul.</span>--The strong personality of the Apostle asserts itself; instead of going into an elaborate proof, he speaks with dogmatic authority, as though his bare word were enough.<p><span class= "bld">Shall profit you nothing.</span>--"Profit," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the way of justification, as producing that state of righteousness in the sight of God by virtue of which the believer is released from wrath and received into the divine favour. The Apostle says that if this state of justification is sought through circumcision, it cannot be sought through Christ at the same time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I Paul say unto you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">lo</span>, <span class="accented">I Paul say unto you.</span> The adverbial exclamation <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, found in St. Paul's writings only here (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17</a> it should be <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>), seems to be more abrupt than <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span>, pointing to the immense importance and yet possibly unexpected character of what follows. The Galatians might be surprised to hear it; but that which they seemed disposed to take in hand was fraught with utter ruin. "I, Paul:" he thus puts forward his personality, as solemnly gaging his whole credit and responsibility upon the truth of that which he is about to affirm. The turn of thought is somewhat different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a> the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> of the Textus Receptus is replaced by recent editors by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which is better suited to the posture of mind of those Pharisee Christians who had in view the abhorrent uncleanness attaching, as they considered, to those described as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-3.htm">Acts 11:3</a>); upon whom themselves the Jews fastened the epithet of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not as a mere colourless <span class="accented">anti-theton</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, but as a selected term of reproach as objects of offence and disgust. The apostle, on the other hand, is here not thinking of outward corporeal condition; for he presently (ver. 6) affirms that in Christ Jesus it mattered nothing whether a man were in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> or in <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as indeed he proved to be his feeling by circumcising Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a>). It is the posture of mind that the apostle-is thinking of exclusively. What was this? The very warning of this verse shows, that, in wishing for circumcision, these Galatians did not <span class="accented">intend</span> to withdraw from Christ; and it appears from the next verse that they did not, either, contemplate the doing of the whole Law. But then, too, the fourth verse, in which apparently the apostle means to explain and justify the assertion of this second verse, indicates that they sought circumcision with the view of being justified by the Law; not, as has just been remarked, by obeying the whole Law, but by submitting themselves to the Law so far as undergoing this one rite prescribed by it. The conclusion to be drawn from these premisses is that what the apostle means is this: If ye have yourselves circumcised with the view of thereby obtaining righteousness before God, ye forfeit all hope of receiving benefit from Christ (see note on Galatians 4:10). In comparing the present passage with <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12, 13</a>, we observe that, while here he is dealing with those who sought circumcision with the view of assuring their righteousness before God, he is there referring to persons actuated by an altogether different set of motives. <span class="cmt_word">Christ shall profit you nothing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). "The future tense marks the certain result of their being circumcised: 'Christ (as you will find) will never profit you anything'" (Bishop Ellicott). The future time is not, in particular, for example, the time of Christ's second coming; but that which follows upon their receiving circumcision - the hour in which their distrust in Christ eventuated in the overt act of having themselves circumcised for the purpose of gaining righteousness thereby, would decisively cut them off from Christ. Their circumcision would be for them the sacrament of excision from Christ. We may compare with this the awful passage referring to the consequences accruing to Jewish Christians from their relapsing to Judaism, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-30</a>. It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this passage, in determining the relation between trust in Christ's atonement and participation in the benefits of that atonement. It is at his extreme peril that a Christian allows himself in misgivings as to whether Christ's mediation is all-sufficient for the securing of his peace with God and his part in God's kingdom. It is by <span class="accented">reliance</span> upon Christ's work that his salvation through Christ is secured; by <span class="accented">distrust</span> in it his salvation is brought into peril; by <span class="accented">definite unbelief</span> his salvation is forfeited. This is in perfect accordance with the apostolic doctrine in general; but rarely is it so strongly and incisively asserted as it is here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Christ will not be the Saviour of any who will not own and rely upon him as their only Saviour. Let us take heed to the warnings and persuasions of the apostle to stedfastness in the doctrine and liberty of the gospel. All true Christians, being taught by the Holy Spirit, wait for eternal life, the reward of righteousness, and the object of their hope, as the gift of God by faith in Christ; and not for the sake of their own works. The Jewish convert might observe the ceremonies or assert his liberty, the Gentile might disregard them or might attend to them, provided he did not depend upon them. No outward privileges or profession will avail to acceptance with God, without sincere faith in our Lord Jesus. True faith is a working grace; it works by love to God, and to our brethren. May we be of the number of those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. The danger of old was not in things of no consequence in themselves, as many forms and observances now are. But without faith working by love, all else is worthless, and compared with it other things are of small value.</body></html>
