On the other hand, dissensions will be fatal, not to one party only, but to all who take part in them.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">For.</span>--This connecting particle supplies the reason for the Apostle's severe treatment of the Judaisers.<p><span class= "bld">An occasion to the flesh.</span>--Do not, under the name "liberty," give way to sensual excesses. This was the especial danger of the Gentile churches, such as Corinth, from which, as we have seen, the Apostle may have been writing. Galatia, too, was a Gentile church; and though it was for the present subject rather to Judaising influences, the character of the people was fickle, and St. Paul may have thought it well to hint a caution in this direction.<p><span class= "bld">Serve.</span>--There is a stress upon this word. The Apostle had been dissuading the Galatians from submitting to other forms of servitude. This one he will permit them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For, brethren, ye have</span> <span class="cmt_word">been called unto liberty</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); <span class="accented">for ye</span>, <span class="accented">brethren</span>, <span class="accented">were called unto</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">for</span>) <span class="accented">freedom.</span> The "for" points back to the closing words of the preceding verse, which implied a settled state of well-being from which those troublers were driving his readers; that happy state (the apostle says) was the very glory and essence of their "calling." This, of course, was that condition of free men described at the end of the foregoing chapter, and summarized in the first verse of this chapter. This is again, even more briefly, recapitulated in the first clause of the present verse. As the summary in the first verse supplied a starting-point for the warnings against the Judaizers which have taken up the foregoing twelve verses, so this new summary furnishes the starting-point for exhortations designed to guard the evangelical doctrine against antinomian perversion, by insisting upon the moral behaviour required of those who enjoy the freedom which Christ gives. These exhortations occupy the remainder of this chapter and a part of the next. "Ye," being what ye are, believers baptized into Christ. The verb "were called" expresses a complete idea, meaning of itself without any adjunct, "called by God to be people of his own" (cf. "calleth," ver. 8, and the passages there cited). The words, "unto," or "for, freedom," supply an adjunct notion; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>, the clause, "in one hope of your calling," does to the same verb. So again <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>," For God called us, not unto [or, 'for' ] uncleanness, but in sanctification.' 'The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, both in the passage last cited and in the present verse, denotes the condition or understanding upon which God had called them: they were "called" upon the understanding that they should be in a state of liberty. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, "Created in Christ Jesus unto ['Greek,' for] good works." God calls us in Christ to be free in these three respects: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> free from condemnation and conscience of guiltiness; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> free from pupil-age to a ceremonial institute of positive, carnal ordinances, and from bondage to a letter-Law; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> free, as consciously his children, knit to him by his adopting Spirit, which makes us partakers of his nature. <span class="cmt_word">Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">only</span>, <span class="accented">no freedom which shall be an occasion to the flesh</span>! or, <span class="accented">only</span>, make <span class="accented">not your freedom into an occasion for the flesh.</span> The noun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, being in the accusative, cannot be taken as simply a resumption of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> immediately before. In his eagerness to at once bar the antinomian's abuse of the gospel, the apostle omits the verb which should account for this accusative; and the result is a sentence which may be taken as grouping with various passages in classical Greek authors, being in fact quite a natural way of speaking in any language; such as in Demosthenes, ' Philippians,' 1. p. 45, "No ten thousand mercenaries for me! (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" Sophocles, ' Ant.,' 573, "No more loiterings! but... (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>...); "<span class="accented">Aristo</span>phanes, ' <span class="accented">Ach.</span>,' 326, "No false pretences for me, but... (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span>)." In such cases it simply weakens the vivacity of the style, if we supply any verb. The alternative rendering supplies <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which is in fact found in two uncial manuscripts, F, G, or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, proposed by OEcumenius. In the former way of construing we have in thought to supply a second <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a>. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is need as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>, etc. The sense of the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, starting-point, is well illustrated by its use, in the military language of Greece, for a "basis of operations" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>). Reflection at once shows us that a "<span class="accented">freedom"</span> which allows a man to obey the behests of his lower nature is only by a false use of the term capable of being grouped with that freedom wherewith Christ makes us free. It adopts out of the latter the single element of emancipation from ceremonial law and letter-Law, and lets go altogether the concomitant notions of spiritual emancipation which are of its very essence. Such an emancipation hands its victim clean over to the thraldom of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18, 19</a>). St. Peter, in his First Epistle, addressed to a large group of Churches founded by St. Paul, including those of Galatia, has a number of passages which apparently take up sentiments and even expressions found in St. Paul's writings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>), as it were, ratifying them; and possibly he has an eye to the present verse when he writes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>), "as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of <span class="accented">wickedness</span>, but as bond-servants of God." "The flesh" is not to have its own way, but is to own the mastery of the Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">But by love serve one another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but through love be in bondage to one another</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let love make you bondservants to one another. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> also means "do acts of bond-service,' as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-7.htm">Ephesians 6:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>. This sense is included in the "being in bondage ' here spoken cf. In the present posture of affairs in these Churches, the apostle sees occasion for selecting just here one particular branch of Christian goodness to enforce upon their observance. Presently after (vers. 16-20 he enlarges the field of view; though even there still giving much prominence to the vices of malignity and to the benignant virtues. Just now he has his eye especially on the evils of contentiousness (ver. 15), and upon love as their corrective. We may suppose such evils were now especially rife amongst the Galatians, whose natural character, commonly described as quarrelsome, was apparently evincing itself in connection with the disputes which the teaching and yet more the outward action of the Judaizers were giving rise to. In fact, a loving temper of mind, along with other benefits, is recommended also by this, that it guards Churches from corrupting innovations in doctrine and Church practice; checking our self-will and our obtrusive vanity, it leads us to avoid giving uneasiness to others by thrusting upon them new notions or new modes of conduct, and makes it our ambition to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. The pattern set by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15</a>), both in washing his disciples' feet and indeed in his whole incarnate life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>), was grandly imitated by the apostle himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-22</a>), who in outward things habitually sacrificed the pride of independence and self-assertion, and the pride of apparent self-consistency, in his devotion to the spiritual welfare of men. He here preaches just what he himself practised. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:13-15 The gospel is a doctrine according to godliness, 1Ti 6:3, and is so far from giving the least countenance to sin, that it lays us under the strongest obligation to avoid and subdue it. The apostle urges that all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. If Christians, who should help one another, and rejoice one another, quarrel, what can be expected but that the God of love should deny his grace, that the Spirit of love should depart, and the evil spirit, who seeks their destruction, should prevail? Happy would it be, if Christians, instead of biting and devouring one another on account of different opinions, would set themselves against sin in themselves, and in the places where they live.</body></html>
