The effects which the flesh produces are plain and obvious enough. The catalogue which follows is not drawn up on any exact scientific principle, but divides itself roughly under four heads: (1) sins of sensuality; (2) sins of superstition; (3) sins of temper; (4) excesses.<p>It has been said that all our sinfulness may be resolved "into two elementary instincts: the instinct of self-preservation and the reproductive instinct." The third class of sins--sins of temper--would be referred to the first of the heads; sins of sensuality and excess--the one immediately, the other more remotely--to the second. The sins of superstition mentioned are of a more secondary character, and arise out of intellectual errors.<p><span class= "bld">Adultery.</span>--This word is omitted in the best MSS.<p><span class= "bld">Uncleanness, lasciviousness.</span>--The first of these words signifies any kind of impurity, secret or open; the second flagrant breaches of public decency.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the works of the flesh are manifest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). The apostle's purpose is here altogether one of practical exhortation. Having in ver. 13 emphatically warned the Galatians against making their emancipation from the Mosaic Law an occasion for the flesh, and in ver. 16 affirmed the incompatibility of a spiritual walk with the fulfilment of the desire of the flesh, he now specifies samples of the vices, whether in outward conduct or in inward feeling, in which the working of the flesh is apparent, as if cautioning them; adducing just those into which the Galatian converts would naturally be most in danger of falling. Both in the list which he gives them of .,ins, and in that of Christian graces, he is careful to note those relative to their Church life as well as those bearing upon their personal private life. Instances of enumeration of sins which may be compared with that here given, are found, with respect to the heathen world, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29-31</a>; with reference to Christians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3-5</a>, followed by a brief indication of fruits of the Spirit in ver. 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2-4</a>. "Manifest;" namely, to our moral sense; we at once feel that these are the outcome of an evil nature, and are incompatible with the influence of the Spirit of God. "Works of the flesh" means works in which the prompting of the flesh is recognizable. The phrase is equivalent to "the deeds or doings of the body," which we are called to "mortify, put to death, by the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-13.htm">Ephesians 5:13</a> they are styled "works of darkness," that is, works belonging properly to a state in which the moral sense has not been quickened by the Spirit, or in which the light of Christ's presence has not shone. Which are these (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">of which sort are.</span> Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>], <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). This is the first group, consisting of offences against <span class="accented">chastity - sins</span> against which the Church has to contend in all ages and in all countries; but which idolatry, especially such idolatry as that of Cybele in Galatia, has generally much fostered. The first in our English Bible, "<span class="accented">adultery</span>," <span class="accented">is</span> rejected from the Greek text by the general consent of editors. But in fact, "<span class="accented">fornication"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) may be taken as including it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>), though it may also stand at its side as a distinct species of unchastity. "<span class="accented">uncleanness"</span> covers a wider range of sensual sin ("all uncleanness," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>); solitary impurity, whether in thought or deed; unnatural lust (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>), though it can hardly be taken as meaning this lust alone. "Lasciviousness," or "<span class="accented">wantonness</span>," is scarcely an adequate rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in this connection; it appears to point to reckless <span class="accented">shamelessness</span> in unclean indulgences. In classical Greek the adjective <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> describes a man insolently and wantonly reckless in his treatment of others; but in the New Testament it generally appears to point more specifically to unabashed open indulgence in impurity. The noun is connected with "uncleanness" and "fornication' 'in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>; with "uncleanness' ' in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>; is used of the men of Sodom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a>; l Peter 4:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a> (cf. 7). Only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-22.htm">Mark 7:22</a> can it from the grouping be naturally taken in its classical sense. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:16-26 If it be our care to act under the guidance and power of the blessed Spirit, though we may not be freed from the stirrings and oppositions of the corrupt nature which remains in us, it shall not have dominion over us. Believers are engaged in a conflict, in which they earnestly desire that grace may obtain full and speedy victory. And those who desire thus to give themselves up to be led by the Holy Spirit, are not under the law as a covenant of works, nor exposed to its awful curse. Their hatred of sin, and desires after holiness, show that they have a part in the salvation of the gospel. The works of the flesh are many and manifest. And these sins will shut men out of heaven. Yet what numbers, calling themselves Christians, live in these, and say they hope for heaven! The fruits of the Spirit, or of the renewed nature, which we are to do, are named. And as the apostle had chiefly named works of the flesh, not only hurtful to men themselves, but tending to make them so to one another, so here he chiefly notices the fruits of the Spirit, which tend to make Christians agreeable one to another, as well as to make them happy. The fruits of the Spirit plainly show, that such are led by the Spirit. By describing the works of the flesh and fruits of the Spirit, we are told what to avoid and oppose, and what we are to cherish and cultivate; and this is the sincere care and endeavour of all real Christians. Sin does not now reign in their mortal bodies, so that they obey it, Ro 6:12, for they seek to destroy it. Christ never will own those who yield themselves up to be the servants of sin. And it is not enough that we cease to do evil, but we must learn to do well. Our conversation will always be answerable to the principle which guides and governs us, Ro 8:5. We must set ourselves in earnest to mortify the deeds of the body, and to walk in newness of life. Not being desirous of vain-glory, or unduly wishing for the esteem and applause of men, not provoking or envying one another, but seeking to bring forth more abundantly those good fruits, which are, through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God.</body></html>
