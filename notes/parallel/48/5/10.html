"Have confidence with respect to you." The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is used as in 2 Colossians 8:22, equivalently with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> in 2 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:4</a>; in which last passage ("We have confidence in the Lord touching you" ), as well as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-24.htm">Philippians 2:24</a> ("I have confidence in the Lord that I myself shall come shortly" ), the phrase, "in the Lord," expresses, not the object of trust, but the sphere of consciousness in which he is able to feel this confidence. So also here, in the realized presence of the Lord Jesus, the apostle feels that his care for his people, and his faithfulness towards these in whom "he has begun a good work" so conspicuously as in their case, warrant him in entertaining a strong assurance that, after all, they would not disappoint his hopes (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>). This expression of confidence implies, of course, a measure of underlying apprehension; while it is also in effect an admonition, couched in an affectionate form, designed to rally them back to their true allegiance. The phrase, "with respect to you," separates their case from that of any who were "troubling them;" kindly implying that, in the main, they were still unperverted. <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye will be none otherwise minded</span> (<span class="greek_word">o%ti ou)de\n</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); that is, that your sentiments will continue, or will be found to be, such as I have been setting forth as those inspired by the gospel, and such as you once manifestly entertained. The future tense of the verb seems to point forward to the time when his appeal should have reached them, and have led them to bethink themselves as to what, in spite of perhaps some momentary superficial wavering, their sentiments at bottom really were. (For the sense of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-15.htm">Philippians 3:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">But he that troubleth</span> <span class="cmt_word">you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but he that is troubling</span> you. "But;" indicating that, even if such a person's machinations proved abortive, through their steady adherence to the gospel, that man should receive his deserts none the less. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> we had "There are some that trouble you," Comparing the two expressions, the one in the singular number, the other in the plural, we may conclude, <span class="accented">either</span> that the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> designates any one who shall be found falling under the description of a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any one of those referred to in the plural number; <span class="accented">or</span> that it points to one particular individual on whom the apostle had his eye as the prime ringleader of the rest. If we adopt the first view, the clause, "whosoever he be," appears to mark the absoluteness of the resolve expressed by the apostle, while leaving in indefiniteness the individual to whom it would apply. With the second view, the same clause would affirm that no circumstances attaching to the offender, such as (suppose) a mission from leading Churchmen in Jerusalem, or official eminence in a Galatian Church, or any other, should shield him, as he or others might suppose that it would, from the effect of the sentence to be pronounced upon him. The second seems the more probable view; and, in unison with it, it appears supposable that the hypothetical case stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> ("if we or an angel from heaven" ) had an eye to the eminent position held by the person here alluded to. This individualization of the threatening would make it the more telling when the letter should arrive - a thunder-clap bursting forth upon the head of that arch-troubler. <span class="cmt_word">Shall bear his</span> <span class="cmt_word">judgment, whosoever he be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>). With the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, compare <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-47.htm">Luke 20:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-2.htm">Romans 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>. "Shall bear," as a heavy burden (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2, 5</a>). The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> a shall be laid upon him, and carry it he shall, whether he will or no. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> judgment, is the "sentence;" the decision of the judge upon his conduct, and the consequent punishment. The apostle threatens that he will bring into exercise the "power" which, as he says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>, the Lord had given him for the edification of his people, and the use of which would be accompanied by consequences proving that "Christ was speaking in him" (ibid., 2, 3). Instances of its exercise are seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-11.htm">Acts 13:11</a>. How grievous was this offender's guilt has been strongly declared by the "anathema" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7-9</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-12 The life of a Christian is a race, wherein he must run, and hold on, if he would obtain the prize. It is not enough that we profess Christianity, but we must run well, by living up to that profession. Many who set out fairly in religion, are hindered in their progress, or turn out of the way. It concerns those who begin to turn out of the way, or to tire in it, seriously to inquire what hinders them. The opinion or persuasion, ver. 8, was, no doubt, that of mixing the works of the law with faith in Christ in justification. The apostle leaves them to judge whence it must arise, but sufficiently shows that it could be owing to none but Satan. It is dangerous for Christian churches to encourage those who follow, but especially who spread, destructive errors. And in reproving sin and error, we should always distinguish between the leaders and the led. The Jews were offended, because Christ was preached as the only salvation for sinners. If Paul and others would have admitted that the observance of the law of Moses was to be joined with faith in Christ, as necessary to salvation, then believers might have avoided many of the sufferings they underwent. The first beginnings of such leaven should be opposed. And assuredly those who persist in disturbing the church of Christ must bear their judgment.</body></html>
