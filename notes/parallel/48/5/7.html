What sudden intruder has stopped your path and led you astray? Certainly it is not God, to whom you owe your calling, that has persuaded you to such a course. You tell me that not many have fallen away. But those few are enough to infect the whole. Not that I wish to implicate all in the sin of some. Most of you I can trust to be true to me. The author of your troubles, whoever he is, shall not escape. God shall judge him. Do you turn round on me and say that I, too, have preached circumcision? The persecutions that I have to undergo from the Jews are proof that I preach it no longer. If I do preach circumcision then the other stumbling-blocks in the way of my teaching are removed. I have no need to lay stress upon a crucified Messiah. The advocates of circumcision may carry their self-mutilation a step further if they please.<p>This section is very abrupt in style. The thought bounds from subject to subject, not stopping to insert links of connection. At the end of the passage there is a vein of severe irony.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Ye did run well.</span>--Again, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>, a metaphor from foot racing. The Galatians had made a good start, but suddenly changed their course.<p><span class= "bld">Who did hinder you</span>?--The metaphor here is not quite the same, but is somewhat akin to that just used. The original meaning of the word translated "hinder" is to "break up a road," as an army before the advance of hostile forces.<p><span class= "bld">The truth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the doctrine taught by St. Paul in opposition to the Judaising tenets which had been introduced into the Galatian Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-12.</span> - In these verses the language is remarkably curt and disjointed. Their style seems to betoken, <span class="accented">either</span> the mind of the writer musing in painful embarrassment, uncertain how best to grapple with the case before him through imperfect knowledge of the circumstances ("Who did hinder you?" ); <span class="accented">or</span>, possibly, the painful effort which it cost the apostle to "write with his own hand." In ver. 13 he at length takes up a line of thought which he is able to follow on with fulness and fluency. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye did run well</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">full well ye were running.</span> "To run" is a favourite figure with St. Paul, drawn from the foot-races of the Isthmian Games or other public games common throughout the Roman empire, and applied above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>) to his own course of apostolic service, but here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>, in a wider reference to the course of general Christian obedience. In vers. 5, 6 the apostle has indicated the proper character of a Christian believer's life, as one which is animated by a faith energizing through love, and by the anticipation of attaining hereafter the awards to be rendered to the justified. Compare the general strain of thought, strikingly similar to that in the present context, pursued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12-15</a>. Obviously, one Important element in the comparison is the Christian's forward advance in self-improvement, as well as his continuing prosecution of work for Christ's cause. These characteristics had, and not long before, marked the manner of life of the Galatian Christians. Upon the recurrence of this recollection, here again, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-16</a>, the apostle bewails the change that had taken place. They <span class="accented">had</span> been so full of joy and of love in believing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14, 15</a>). But now an incipient relinquishment of their hope in Christ had left them cheerless, and, in consequence, ready to look abroad in quest of other grounds of assured confidence; while also the thence ensuing conflicts of controversy and faction had marred their once happy mutual concord (ver. 15). The form of Christian life which the Galatian Churchmen had in those days presented to view was apparently similar to that which at an earlier date he had described as marking the Thessalonian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>), and at a later time applauds in the Colossian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4-6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who aid hinder you</span>; or, <span class="accented">who did drive you back</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span>]). The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> of the Textus Receptus would mean, as in the margin of our English Bibles, "Who has driven [or, beaten, struck] you back," and would be illustrated by the use of the verb in Wisd. 18:23, "Standing between, he beat back the wrath," as Aaron did. But <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> is the reading of all recent editors. The precise meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> does not seem to be, as some suppose, "to stop," but rather "to hamper, shackle, impede." It occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-4.htm">Acts 24:4</a>, "be tedious;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>, "Satan hindered;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-22.htm">Romans 15:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>, "hindered." So the substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>, "That we may cause no hindrance to [clog the success of] the gospel." Possibly this sense is derived from the hindrance caused to the traveller by the road being "cut into" or cut up before he goes over it. But it is more probably connected with the use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> in the sense of "worry," as in Demosthenes, 'Olynth.,' it. p. 22, "Worried from time to time by these expeditions up and down." So here, "Who was it that clogged your steps in running your race?" Not positively "arrested your steps:" this disastrous result, it was to be hoped, was not yet brought about; they were only as yet lagging in their course. This interrogation "who" does not so much demand that the evil worker shall be named and brought to light, as express the pity of it, that any one should have been able to work them so much mischief; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>. Nevertheless, the author of the mischief had cause to tremble (see ver. 12, and note). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should not obey the truth?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> [T. Tr., Lightfoot, omit the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>;); <span class="accented">that ye should not be hearkening unto the truth</span> (or, <span class="accented">unto truth</span>)? "The truth" directly cites the gospel; that is, the gospel which proclaims righteousness as theirs who believe in Christ apart from works of the ceremonial law; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>, "That the truth of the gospel might continue with you," the particular phase of the gospel there intended being clearly evinced from the circumstances referred to. "Truth," without the article, denoting "that which is true," cites the same by implication. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, frequently rendered in the Authorized Version by "obey," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>, properly means to lend a compliant ear to advice or persuasion; "to hearken," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-36.htm">Acts 5:36, 37, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-21.htm">Acts 23:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-11.htm">Acts 27:11</a>. The apostle means that they were turning their ears away from the truth to listen to pernicious counsels or teaching. The verb is in the present tense with reference to the continued attention which they ought to be now giving to the gospel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:7-12 The life of a Christian is a race, wherein he must run, and hold on, if he would obtain the prize. It is not enough that we profess Christianity, but we must run well, by living up to that profession. Many who set out fairly in religion, are hindered in their progress, or turn out of the way. It concerns those who begin to turn out of the way, or to tire in it, seriously to inquire what hinders them. The opinion or persuasion, ver. 8, was, no doubt, that of mixing the works of the law with faith in Christ in justification. The apostle leaves them to judge whence it must arise, but sufficiently shows that it could be owing to none but Satan. It is dangerous for Christian churches to encourage those who follow, but especially who spread, destructive errors. And in reproving sin and error, we should always distinguish between the leaders and the led. The Jews were offended, because Christ was preached as the only salvation for sinners. If Paul and others would have admitted that the observance of the law of Moses was to be joined with faith in Christ, as necessary to salvation, then believers might have avoided many of the sufferings they underwent. The first beginnings of such leaven should be opposed. And assuredly those who persist in disturbing the church of Christ must bear their judgment.</body></html>
