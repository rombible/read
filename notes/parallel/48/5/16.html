It is easy to tell which has the upper hand--the flesh or the Spirit. The flesh is known by a long catalogue of sins, the Spirit by a like catalogue of Christian graces, the mere mention of which is enough to show that the Law has no power over them. Those who belong to Christ have got rid of the flesh, with all its impulses, by their union with a crucified Saviour. All the Christian has to do is to act really by the rule of the Spirit, without self-parade or quarrelling.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">Walk.</span>--Conduct yourselves: a metaphor very common in the writings of St. Paul, but not peculiar to them.

It points back to the line of remark commenced in ver. 13 in the words, "No freedom to be an occasion to the flesh! but through love be in bondage one to another." The voluntary bondage of love is one most important part of the spiritual life; as indulgence in malignant passions is also a leading branch of the working of the flesh. The mention, therefore, of these two points in vers. 14, 15 naturally leads up to the more general exhortation of the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil</span> (or, <span class="accented">fulfil not</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the lust of the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">walk by the Spirit</span>, <span class="accented">and ye shall not fulfil the lust</span> (or, <span class="accented">desire</span>) <span class="accented">of the flesh.</span> The precise meaning of the several words and statements in this verse, as also in the two which follow it, have been much disputed. It must suffice here briefly to explain and justify what appears to the present writer the true view. The word "spirit," it seems most natural to understand in all three in the same sense. To take it in the first two verses as meaning that part of our composite being which has the nearest affinity to the higher moral and spiritual life (whether as in a state of nature or as informed by the Spirit of God), whilst in ver. 18 its import is determined by comparison with other passages to be the Divine Spirit, appears to be an arbitrary variation of its sense, which there is no necessity for adopting. The "Spirit" is mentioned alongside with "the flesh," not because it belongs to the like category of being a part of our nature, but because he has been graciously sent forth by God to contravene in us that evil principle which else we should be unable to overcome. This evil principle is termed "the flesh;" not as being merely <span class="accented">sensual</span> corruption, though vices of that class are mentioned in vers. 19 and 21 as leading instances of its working; for we see in vers. 20 and 21 vicious works of the flesh specified, which are to be referred to malignity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>), or to a perversion of the religious element, rather than to sensuality. It appears, therefore, to denote the principle of corruption which taints our moral nature in general - that which in the ninth of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England is deflated under the heading of "Original or Birth-Sin.' The word "flesh" may be supposed to have been selected to denote this, because the depravation of our sensuous beings into sensuality constituted the most prominent and noticeable form in which the general degradation of our state from its proper nobler life in God manifests itself. The dative case of <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, marks <span class="accented">- either</span> the sphere, element, path, in which we are to walk, which is intended by the rendering in our Authorized Version, "in the Spirit," as the dative is used with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (Authorized Version, "walk" ) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-31.htm">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-16.htm">Acts 14:16</a>, and with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, walk, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>; or the rule <span class="accented">according to</span> which, together with the enabling power <span class="accented">by</span> which, our daily behaviour is to be regulated, so as to be synonymous with the phrase, "walking after (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>) the Spirit," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>. The meaning at all events seems to be, Let the prompting of the Spirit be your guide, and the grace of the Spirit your strength, in the course of your life continually. This is afterwards expressed as being "led by the Spirit" (ver. 18), and as an "orderly walking by the Spirit' (ver. 25). The exhortation implies two things: first, that the Christians addressed, had had the gift of the Holy Spirit imparted to them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>, where" our hearts" includes the persons addressed; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>); and next, that this gift would not avail for the actual sanctification of their life without diligent endeavours after self-improvement on their own part. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>, "Work out your own salvation [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by your own endeavours work out your salvation] with fear and trembling; for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure." The generality of the form in which the exhortation is couched intimates that they were to endeavour to live in compliance with the Spirit's promptings in all the branches of spiritual activity proper to their Christian calling; not only in that of "love" already adverted to, but in those others also which the apostle presently after counts up in vers. 22, 23. It inculcates, therefore, the cultivation of a joyous spirit of filial love towards God, as well as a high strain of virtuous conduct towards their fellow-men and in relation to their own selves. In the next clause, the words, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye shall not fulfil." are by many (see margin of our Authorized Version)taken in an imperative sense; as if it were, walk by the Spirit, and by no means fulfil the desire of the flesh. It is, however, with much force objected to this view that, although the future with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> is often used for an imperative, as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., there is no instance adduced of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> being used in the New Testament in this sense. We are led, therefore, to adopt the other view, that the passage belongs to that form of sentence in which an imperative clause is followed by a clause denoting the result which will ensue in case the direction before given has been complied with; <span class="accented">as e.g.</span> "<span class="accented">Come</span> unto me... and I will give you rest." In place of the simple <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, we have the more emphatic form, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "Of a surety ye will not," etc. By writing thus the apostle strongly accentuates the statement that walking by the Spirit is absolutely incompatible with an indulgence in the inclinations prompted by the flesh. There is probably a twofold doctrinal inference couched under this emphatic statement; namely, Ye will of a surety not fall under the Law's condemnation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>); and, Ye will not need the Law's restraints (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>). But it is pregnant also with a hint of rebuke and of practical direction, not unneeded by the Galatians (ver. 15). The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, probably because it is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-50.htm">Luke 11:50</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>, etc.; so that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is put for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is selected in preference to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) to express the idea that it is impossible for one walking by the Spirit to <span class="accented">carry into full effect</span> any desire of the flesh. For this is the proper force of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, of which the ever-memorable <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "It is finished" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), is a typical illustration. This meaning obtains even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-8.htm">James 2:8</a>. The apostle seems to concede that the desire of the flesh may be felt by one who is walking by the Spirit; nay, even in at least an inchoate degree, given way to; but this much he affirms, that it will be impossible for such a one to ear,' y it out into full accomplishment. This qualified representation of the Christian's holiness is intimated in the next verse more explicitly. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:16-26 If it be our care to act under the guidance and power of the blessed Spirit, though we may not be freed from the stirrings and oppositions of the corrupt nature which remains in us, it shall not have dominion over us. Believers are engaged in a conflict, in which they earnestly desire that grace may obtain full and speedy victory. And those who desire thus to give themselves up to be led by the Holy Spirit, are not under the law as a covenant of works, nor exposed to its awful curse. Their hatred of sin, and desires after holiness, show that they have a part in the salvation of the gospel. The works of the flesh are many and manifest. And these sins will shut men out of heaven. Yet what numbers, calling themselves Christians, live in these, and say they hope for heaven! The fruits of the Spirit, or of the renewed nature, which we are to do, are named. And as the apostle had chiefly named works of the flesh, not only hurtful to men themselves, but tending to make them so to one another, so here he chiefly notices the fruits of the Spirit, which tend to make Christians agreeable one to another, as well as to make them happy. The fruits of the Spirit plainly show, that such are led by the Spirit. By describing the works of the flesh and fruits of the Spirit, we are told what to avoid and oppose, and what we are to cherish and cultivate; and this is the sincere care and endeavour of all real Christians. Sin does not now reign in their mortal bodies, so that they obey it, Ro 6:12, for they seek to destroy it. Christ never will own those who yield themselves up to be the servants of sin. And it is not enough that we cease to do evil, but we must learn to do well. Our conversation will always be answerable to the principle which guides and governs us, Ro 8:5. We must set ourselves in earnest to mortify the deeds of the body, and to walk in newness of life. Not being desirous of vain-glory, or unduly wishing for the esteem and applause of men, not provoking or envying one another, but seeking to bring forth more abundantly those good fruits, which are, through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God.</body></html>
