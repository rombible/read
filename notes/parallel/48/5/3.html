The original construction and force of the verb are shown in Judith 7:28, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>. The apostle is wont to use it with a distinct sense of its emphatic import (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). The word "again" points, not to the substance of the subsequent affirmation, as if it were a repetition of that mode in the preceding verse, which in fact it does not appear to be, but to the solemnity with which he makes this fresh affirmation. For the phrase, "I Paul say unto you," was one form of solemn affirmation which in effect gaged his personality as Christ's apostle and as acting in his name; and this "I protest" is another of equally solemn import. <span class="cmt_word">To every man that is circumcised</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>); <span class="accented">to every man that is having himself circumcised.</span> St. Paul's statements elsewhere, and his own proceeding in circumcising Timothy, as well as the present context, make it certain that, however absolute and universal his affirmation at first sight seems to be, it is nevertheless meant to be taken as made with reference to certain understood conditions. Thus: "I protest to any one of you Gentiles, who, being already baptized into Christ, has himself circumcised with the view of winning righteousness and favour with God, by obeying this one prescription of the Law - that," etc. The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> is most probably the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> of transition (metabatic), introducing a fresh particular merely; and in this instance, as often, it needs not to be represented in translation at all. Certainly s for" is not its meaning. Possibly, as De Wette supposes, it points back, as an adversative, to the words," Christ shall profit you nothing," as if it were "but on the contrary." <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">he is a debtor to do the whole Law</span> (<span class="greek_word">o%ti o)feile/th</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">that he is under obligation</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">is a debtor</span>) <span class="accented">to do the whole Law.</span> By having himself circumcised, he adopts the token of the Lord's covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11, 13</a>) made with those who were his people after the flesh; he enrolls himself with them to share with them their obligations. And to them the Lord had given the Law of Mount Sinai to be their appointed <span class="accented">pedagogue</span> till the Christ should come. "By being circumcised" (he means) "you of your own accord put yourself back afresh under this pedagogue, and just <span class="accented">his</span> bidding you must do. And for what? All the ordinances and ceremonies he puts you upon observing will leave you as far off as ever from remission of sins and justification with God! And this self-surrender to the pedagogue God has not asked for at <span class="accented">your</span> hands; while what he does require, that you withhold, even faith in him whom he hath sent: nay, not merely withhold your belief, but by open act and deed testify your <span class="accented">disbelief</span> in him." Under all that the apostle is here writing there appears to lie the principle, which, however, he has not distinctly stored, but which we see to be true, that circumcision was the peculiar badge of "Israel after the flesh," appertaining to them alone and not to be meddled with by any who did not mean to become naturalized as fellow-citizens with them. (For the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>.) The noun more commonly points to a debt incurred, or guiltiness; but here it simply denotes obligation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Christ will not be the Saviour of any who will not own and rely upon him as their only Saviour. Let us take heed to the warnings and persuasions of the apostle to stedfastness in the doctrine and liberty of the gospel. All true Christians, being taught by the Holy Spirit, wait for eternal life, the reward of righteousness, and the object of their hope, as the gift of God by faith in Christ; and not for the sake of their own works. The Jewish convert might observe the ceremonies or assert his liberty, the Gentile might disregard them or might attend to them, provided he did not depend upon them. No outward privileges or profession will avail to acceptance with God, without sincere faith in our Lord Jesus. True faith is a working grace; it works by love to God, and to our brethren. May we be of the number of those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. The danger of old was not in things of no consequence in themselves, as many forms and observances now are. But without faith working by love, all else is worthless, and compared with it other things are of small value.</body></html>
