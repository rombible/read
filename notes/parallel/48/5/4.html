The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is a favourite word with St. Paul, occurring twenty-seven times in his Epistles, including twice in the Hebrews, whilst in the rest of the New Testament it occurs only once, and that in the Pauline St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-7.htm">Luke 13:7</a>). Its proper meaning is "to make inoperative," "make of no effect," as above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>, etc., occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2</a>, "If the husband die (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>), she is discharged from the law of the husband;" it ceases to have any effect upon her; so ibid., ver. 6, "Now we have been discharged from the Law (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>);" it has ceased to have any operation towards us. The phrase combines the two ideas <span class="accented">- separation</span> suggested by the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>), and the <span class="accented">cessation of a work</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) or an <span class="accented">effect</span> till then wrought by one upon the other of the two parties: the two parties have nothing more to do with each other. The sense given in the Authorized Version is perfectly justifiable; only, perhaps, here the passive takes, as it sometimes does, the reflective sense of the middle verb; but it may be that the apostle means simply to express the result which has accrued. The aorist tense of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, as well as of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, expresses the certainty and promptness with which the result followed upon the (supposed) act. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever of you</span> <span class="cmt_word">are justified by the Law</span> (<span class="greek_word">oi%tine e)n no/mw""</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">such of you as go about to be justified by the Law.</span> "By the Law;" literally, <span class="accented">in the Law</span>; seek to find in the Law the means of justification (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>, and note). The present tense is the present of design or endeavour; the result in this case being, in fact, unattainable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye are fallen from grace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">ye have fallen from</span> the state of <span class="accented">grace.</span> "Grace" denotes the condition of acceptance with God into which faith in Christ brings us. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>: "Through whom we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> is used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a>, "Lest - <span class="accented">ye</span> <span class="accented">fall from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) your own steadfastness." So <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>, "Remember whence thou hast fallen [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>]." In classical Greek the verb was frequently used as a set term to describe those who, in the alternating success of adverse factions in the several independent cities of Greece, were compelled by a more powerful adverse party to submit to exile; its correlative verb being <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>. This fact leads Bishop Lightfoot, having an eye to the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-30.htm">Galatians 4:30</a>, to render <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> here, "<span class="accented">are driven forth and banished</span> with Hagar your mother." But this very idiomatic colour of meaning it seems very precarious to give to the word in the Greek of St. Paul. The more general signification of the term is amply sustained by its use in Plutarch as cited by Wetstein. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Christ will not be the Saviour of any who will not own and rely upon him as their only Saviour. Let us take heed to the warnings and persuasions of the apostle to stedfastness in the doctrine and liberty of the gospel. All true Christians, being taught by the Holy Spirit, wait for eternal life, the reward of righteousness, and the object of their hope, as the gift of God by faith in Christ; and not for the sake of their own works. The Jewish convert might observe the ceremonies or assert his liberty, the Gentile might disregard them or might attend to them, provided he did not depend upon them. No outward privileges or profession will avail to acceptance with God, without sincere faith in our Lord Jesus. True faith is a working grace; it works by love to God, and to our brethren. May we be of the number of those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. The danger of old was not in things of no consequence in themselves, as many forms and observances now are. But without faith working by love, all else is worthless, and compared with it other things are of small value.</body></html>
