More often the Apostle speaks of the state of righteousness as conferred upon the Christian at his baptism. This is, however, only a sort of ideal or potential righteousness; it is a state inherent in that kingdom of which the Christian then becomes a member, not a state inherent in the Christian himself. This ideal or potential righteousness becomes real and actual only at the end of the Christian's career, when it is finally confirmed to him. Looking forward to this point, it is an object of hope.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we through the Spirit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">for we</span> for our parts <span class="accented">by the Spirit.</span> "We" who abide in Christ, and continue steadfast in the grace into which Christ has brought us; that is, we believers in Christ, as such.

The presence of this Spirit has been a]ready described as the distinguishing blessing of believers in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2-5, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>); while presently after (ver. 18, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>: 22-25) the apostle dwells on the work of the same Divine Agent in regulating the Christian's habits of feeling and action (the dative as in vers. 16, 18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>). It is here referred to as evincing the Divine sanction which attaches to the particular action of faith and hope now to be described (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Wait</span> <span class="cmt_word">for the hope of righteousness by faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">from</span> the ground <span class="accented">of faith do wait for the hope of righteousness.</span> The term which has the principal accent in this clause is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "from the ground of faith." This appears, both from the preceding context, in which the opposed idea of "justification by the Law" holds the foremost place, requiring here the confronting mention of "faith," and also from the next verse, which substantiates the statement before us by affirming the all-importance of "faith." In point of construction, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> does not appear to qualify "righteousness," although, from the classical text <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a> (Septuagint), it is so often connected with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: but rather the whole clause, "wait for the hope of righteousness." What the apostle is now concerned to say is that it is by virtue of our faith that we look forward to hereafter receiving the hope of righteousness. This, of course, includes our being by faith justified. The word "hope" here designates the object hoped for, and not the sentiment itself. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>, "hope that is seen;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>, "the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, "looking for the blissful hope." The genitive, "of righteousness," may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the "genitive of apposition," the hope which is, or which consists of, righteousness, similar to the genitives in the phrases, "the earnest of the Spirit," "the sign of circumcision,' ' "the leaven of malice," "the recompense of the inheritance," "the peaceable fruit of righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-24.htm">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "the hope of righteousness" may mean the hope that appertains unto righteousness, which would be the "inheritance" spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-18.htm">Galatians 3:18, 22</a>, as accruing, not "from the Law," but to those who are justified by faith. The apostle is not wont to speak of justification as a blessing to be received at the day of final decision, to which he evidently here refers, but as a blessing received at once by those who believe in Christ as the fruit even here of their faith. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>, "Being justified (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) by faith, we have peace with God;" ibid., ver. 11, "We have now received the reconciliation." Thus also in this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24-27</a>) it is declared that, in consequence of being justified by faith, we are clothed with Christ and God's adopted sons (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>). There can surely be no question of the already received justification of those in whom the Spirit testifies that they are sons. Nor does <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a> ("That I may be found in him, having... the righteousness which is through faith in Christ" ) speak a different language: he aspires (he there says) to be in that final judgment found in possession of a righteousness which he had received in this life through the faith which he had in this life exercised. As Bengel here observes, "Paul, in mentioning things beyond, includes and confirms things present." Of Judaical legalism it was true that it did not think itself already possessed of righteousness, but with an ever-unappeased conscience was always still striving after it; whereas it is the privilege and glory of faith that it can enjoy the assurance of being even now justified and at peace with, "at one" with, God. Most certainly, what the apostle here calls "hope" is not the sentiment which we so often thus name when we intend thereby an imperfectly assured expectation of some probably coming good. In the apostle's vocabulary it denotes a confident anticipation unclouded by doubt (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>). In fine, this is what the apostle means: We Christians, as led by the Spirit of adoption, do rest in the confident anticipation of receiving the inheritance which is the future award of the righteous, on the ground of our faith in the Lord Jesus. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in all the six other passages in which it is found, is used with reference to objects or events pertaining to the close of the present dispensation: <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19, 23, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>. The proposition <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> in this compound verb is probably intensive, expressing thorough-goingness; an entirely assured, steadfast expectation, persistent to the end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Christ will not be the Saviour of any who will not own and rely upon him as their only Saviour. Let us take heed to the warnings and persuasions of the apostle to stedfastness in the doctrine and liberty of the gospel. All true Christians, being taught by the Holy Spirit, wait for eternal life, the reward of righteousness, and the object of their hope, as the gift of God by faith in Christ; and not for the sake of their own works. The Jewish convert might observe the ceremonies or assert his liberty, the Gentile might disregard them or might attend to them, provided he did not depend upon them. No outward privileges or profession will avail to acceptance with God, without sincere faith in our Lord Jesus. True faith is a working grace; it works by love to God, and to our brethren. May we be of the number of those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. The danger of old was not in things of no consequence in themselves, as many forms and observances now are. But without faith working by love, all else is worthless, and compared with it other things are of small value.</body></html>
