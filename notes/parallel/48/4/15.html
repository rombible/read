"that is, what was its value in respect to the depth of conviction on which it was founded? - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="accented">qualis</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-3.htm">Luke 19:3</a>, etc., which would bring us to much the same result as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: or, "How great, then, was that gratulation of yours!" But the "then" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) comes in lamely; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("at that time") would have been more in place; and, further, it is questionable whether the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> of admiration ever occurs without the wonder taking a tinge of inquiry, as, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-21.htm">Luke 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, which would be out of place here. With the more approved reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, the apostle asks, "What is, then, become of that gratulation of yourselves?" The "then" recites the fact, implied in the description given of their former behaviour, that they did once felicitate themselves on the apostle's having brought them the gospel. This is more directly brought into view in the words which follow. As the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "pronounce happy," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>, the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> denotes "pronouncing one to be happy;" as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-6.htm">Romans 4:6, 9</a>. So Clement of Rome ('Ad Cor.,' 50), who weaves the apostle's words into his own sentence with the same meaning. This felicitation must have been pronounced by the Galatians upon themselves, not upon the apostle; the apostle would have spoken of himself on the object of their <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not of their <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For I bear</span> <span class="cmt_word">you record</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">for I bear you witness</span>; testify on your behalf; the phrase always denoting commendation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>). Compare "Ye were running well," <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>. The verb denotes a deliberate, almost solemn, averment. <span class="cmt_word">That, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">have given them to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>,); <span class="accented">that</span>, <span class="accented">if possible</span>, <span class="accented">ye had spirted out your eyes to give them to me.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, occurs in the Septuagint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-2.htm">1 Samuel 11:2</a>, Hebrew, "bore out the eyes." The omission of the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>, which is rejected by recent editors, perhaps intimates the certainty and readiness with which they would have done it; but the particle occurs very sparingly in the New Testament as compared with classical Greek. There seems something strange in the specification of this particular form of evidencing zealous attachment. If there had otherwise appeared any question of making gifts, the apostle might have been construed to mean, "Ye were ready to give me anything, your very eyes even;" but this is not the case. Possibly the particular mention of "the Churches of Galatia" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> may have been occasioned by their having shown an especial readiness, even at the apostle's second sojourn among them, to take part in the collection referred to; or by their having been the first Churches he came to in that particular tour, the directions which he gave to them being given also to all the Churches he went on to visit; but on this point see Introd. p. 16. The tone of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6-10</a> does not betoken especial open-handedness on their part, unless, perhaps, the words, "let us not grow weary," hint at a liberality once displayed but now declined from. On the whole, this specification of "eyes" seems rather to point to there having been something amiss with the apostle's own eyes, either from ophthalmia or as the effect of personal outrage perpetrated upon him. It is especially deserving of notice how the apostle, in the two clauses of this verse, links together their joy in their newly found Christian blessedness with their grateful love to himself; the latter fact is adduced as proof of the former. Their gospel happiness, he feels, was indissolubly woven in with their attachment to him: if they let go their joy in Christ Jesus, as, apart from any qualification to be acquired by observances of the Law of Moses, their all-sufficient righteousness, they must also of necessity become estranged from him, who was nothing if not the exponent and herald to them of that happiness. This consideration is of great moment for the right understanding of the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-18 The apostle desires that they would be of one mind with him respecting the law of Moses, as well as united with him in love. In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zeal was better maintained.</body></html>
