It here marks the conclusion resulting from the statements of the preceding six verses, viz. of God having sent forth his Son to do away with the Law, subjection to which had marked the nonage of his people, and to raise them to their complete filial position, and of his then sending forth his Spirit into their hearts loudly protesting their sonship. "No longer art thou;" by this individualizing address the apostle strives to awaken each individual believer to the consciousness of the filial position belonging to him in particular. Believe it: in Christ Jesus, thou, thine own very self, art a son! The phrase, "no longer," marks the position of God's servant new, as compared with what it would have been before Christ had wrought his emancipating work and the Holy Spirit had been sent forth as the Spirit of adoption; <span class="accented">then</span> he would have still been a bond-servant; he is not that now. This abrupt singling out one individual as a sample of all the members of a class is an instance of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Paul's style (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>). The individual cited by the "thou" is neither a Gentile convert only nor a Jewish believer only; it is any member of God's kingdom.

The inheritance here meant is the possession of every blessing which the theocratic kingdom entitles its members to look forward to. And the point of this added clause is that no further qualification is needed for our having a vested right in that inheritance, than that which is supplied by faith in Christ, uniting us to him and making us sharers with him; no such qualification, for example, as the Mosaizing reactionaries insisted upon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>); no observance of ceremonial rites, whether of the Law or of such freaks of heretical" will-worship" as are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>. Thy faith in Christ (says in effect the apostle) gives thee now for good and all an assured place in whatever inheritance God designs to give his people. The manuscripts 'rod other authorities for the text present considerable variety in the reading of the last words of this clause. The reading adopted by L. T. Tr., Meyer, Alford, Lightfoot, and Hort and Westcott, namely, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, is that found in the three oldest uncials, and presents a form of expression which was likely so greatly to surprise the copyist as to set him naturally upon the work of revision; whereas that of the Received Text, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, would have seemed to him so perfectly natural and easy that he would never have thought of altering it. The words, "<span class="accented">heir</span> through <span class="accented">God</span>," taken in connection with the foregoing context, insist upon the especial appointment of the supreme God himself; his intervention displayed in the most conspicuous manner conceivable, through the incarnated Son and the sent-forth Spirit. The believer is here said to be a son and an heir "through God," in the same sense as St. Paul affirms himself to be an apostle "through Jesus Christ and God the Father," and "through the will of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>); for "of him and through him and unto him are all things," and most manifestedly so, the things composing the economy of grace which the gospel announces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>). The apostle has thus brought back his discourse to the same point which it had reached before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>. The reader will do well to carefully compare this section of the Epistle (vers. 3-7) with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25-8:4</a> and Romans 8:14-17. With great similarity in the forms of expression, the difference of the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> object in the two Epistles is clearly discerned. <span class="accented">There</span> he is discoursing the more prominently of the believer's emancipation <span class="accented">from the controlling power of a sinful nature</span>, which, under the Law, viewed under its moral aspect rather than its ceremonial, was rather fretted into yet more aggravated disobedience than quelled or overpowered. <span class="accented">Here</span> his subject is more prominently the believer's emancipation from the thraldom of the Law's cere-monialism, which in the present Epistle, relative to the troubles in the Galatian Churches, he has more occasion to deal with. Both the one deliverance, however, and the other was necessary for the believer's full consciousness of adoptive sonship; and each was, in fact, involved in the other. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The apostle deals plainly with those who urged the law of Moses together with the gospel of Christ, and endeavoured to bring believers under its bondage. They could not fully understand the meaning of the law as given by Moses. And as that was a dispensation of darkness, so of bondage; they were tied to many burdensome rites and observances, by which they were taught and kept subject like a child under tutors and governors. We learn the happier state of Christians under the gospel dispensation. From these verses see the wonders of Divine love and mercy; particularly of God the Father, in sending his Son into the world to redeem and save us; of the Son of God, in submitting so low, and suffering so much for us; and of the Holy Spirit, in condescending to dwell in the hearts of believers, for such gracious purposes. Also, the advantages Christians enjoy under the gospel. Although by nature children of wrath and disobedience, they become by grace children of love, and partake of the nature of the children of God; for he will have all his children resemble him. Among men the eldest son is heir; but all God's children shall have the inheritance of eldest sons. May the temper and conduct of sons ever show our adoption; and may the Holy Spirit witness with our spirits that we are children and heirs of God.</body></html>
