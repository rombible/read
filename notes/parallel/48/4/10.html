The "months," however, mean really "the first day of the month," the "new moon." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall you have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.">Leviticus 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm" title="And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;">Numbers 28:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-3.htm" title="Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.">Psalm 81:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Times.</span>--<span class= "ital">Seasons</span>: such as the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles.<p><span class= "bld">Years.</span>--Such as the sabbatical year and the year of jubilee. The Apostle is giving a list which is intended to be exhaustive of all Jewish observances, so that it would not necessarily follow that the Galatians had actually kept the year of jubilee, or even that it was kept literally by the Jews at this time.<p>As to the bearing of this passage on the general question of the observance of seasons, it is to be noticed that the reference is here to the adoption by the Galatians of the <span class= "ital">Jewish</span> seasons as a mark of the extent to which they were prepared to take on themselves the burden of the Mosaic law. It does not necessarily follow that the observance of Christian seasons is condemned. At the same time, it is quite clear that St. Paul places all such matters under the head of "elements" or "rudiments." They belong to the lowest section of Christian practice, and the more advanced a Christian is the less he needs to be bound by them. This, again, is qualified by the consideration that it is dangerous for any one individual to assume his own advanced condition, and to think himself able to dispense with the safeguards which his brother-Christians require. It is safest to follow the general rule of the Church, so long as it is done <span class= "ital">intelligently</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> with a consciousness of the reason and expediency of what is done, and not in a spirit of mere mechanical routine. The comparison between the literal and the spiritual observance of seasons, and the superiority of the latter as the more excellent way, is well brought out by Origen in some comments upon this passage: "If it be objected to us on this subject that we are accustomed to observe certain days--as, for example, the Lord's Day, the Preparation, the Passover, or Pentecost--I have to answer that, to the perfect Christian--who is ever in his thoughts, words, and deeds serving his natural Lord, God the Word--all his days are the Lord's, and he is always keeping the Lord's Day. He, also, who is unceasingly preparing himself for the true life, and abstaining from the pleasures of this life which lead astray so many, such a one is always keeping the Preparation Day. Again, he who considers that 'Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us,' and that it is his duty to keep the feast by eating of the flesh of the Word, never ceases to keep the Paschal Feast. And, finally, he who can truly say: 'We are risen with Christ,' and 'He hath exalted us, and made us sit with Him in heavenly places in Christ,' is always living in the season of Pentecost . . . But the majority of those who are accounted believers are not of this advanced class; but from being either unable or unwilling to keep every day in this manner, they require some sensible memorial to prevent spiritual things from passing away altogether from their minds" (<span class= "ital">Against Celsus,</span> viii. 22, 23).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye observe days, and months,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and times, and years</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">days ye are intent on observing</span>, <span class="accented">and months</span>, <span class="accented">and seasons</span>, <span class="accented">and years.</span> In the compound verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, the prepositional prefix, which often denotes "amiss," seems rather, from the sense of "at one's side," to give the verb the shade of close, intent observation. This may be shown by the circumstances to be of an insidious character; thus the active <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-2.htm">Mark 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-7.htm">Luke 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-1.htm">Luke 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a>, and the middle <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, with no apparent difference of sense, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20</a>. Josephus uses the verb of "keeping the sabbath days" ('Ant.,' 3:05, 8), and the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, for "observance of the things which are according to the laws" ('Ant.,' 8:03, 9). The accumulation of nouns with the reiterated "and," furnishing another example of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Paul's style, betokens a scornfully impatient mimesis. These reactionaries were full of festival-observing pedantry - "days," "new moons," "festivals," "holy years," being always on their lips. The meaning of the first three of the nouns is partially suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a>, "Let no man judge you... in respect of a feast day, or a new moon, or a sabbath day (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>);" in which passage, we may observe, there is a similar tone of half-mocking mimesis; where the same ideas are apparently presented, but in a reverse order. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-13.htm">2 Chronicles 8:13</a>, Offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles." The "days," then, in the present passage, we may suppose, are the sabbath days, together perhaps with the two fast days every week which the Jewish tradition prescribed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>). The "months" point to the new moons, the observance of which might occasion to these Gentiles considerable scope for discussion in adjusting themselves to the Jewish calendar, different no doubt from the calendar they had been hitherto used to. The "seasons" would be the annual festivals and fasts of the Jews, not only the three prescribed by the Levitical Law, but also certain others added by tradition, as the Feasts of Purim and of Dedication. So far we appear to be on tolerably sure ground. The fourth item, "years," may refer either to the sabbatical year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-2.htm">Leviticus 25:2-7</a>), which at any rate latterly the Jews had got to pay much attention to (1 Macc. 6:49, 53; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:10, 6; also 14:16, 2; Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 5:4); or possibly the jubilee years, one such fiftieth year, it might be, falling about this time due. Bengel ('Gnomon') supposes that a sabbatical year might be being held A.D. , to which date he assigns this Epistle; while Wieseler ('Chronicles Synops.,' p. 204, etc., referred to by Bishop Lightfoot) offers a similar conjecture for the year A.D. autumn to A.D. autumn. Very striking is the impatience which the apostle manifests in overhearing as it were the eager discussions occupying the attention of these foolish Galatian Judaizers. Their interest, he perceived, was absorbed by matters which were properly for them things of no concern at all, but which, with ostentatious zeal as such persons do, they were <span class="accented">making</span> their concern. The cause of their doing so lay, we may believe, in the feeling which was growing up in their minds that such like outward observances would of themselves make their life acceptable to God; this general sentiment habiting itself, in the choice of the particular form of outward ceremonies to be adopted, in the observance of the celebrations given by God to his people for the season of their nonage. The principle itself was no doubt repugnant to the apostle's mind, even apart from the Judaizing form which it was assuming, and which threatened a defection from Christ. Curious regard to such matters he evidently on its own account regards with scorn and impatience. But therewith also the old venerable religion, localized at Jerusalem as its chief seat, would under the impulse of such sentiments be sure to perilously attract their minds away from the "reformation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>) to which it had now been subjected; and they were in danger of losing, nay, had in great degree at least already lost, the zest which they once had fell in embracing the exceeding great and precious gifts which Christ had brought to them. What was there here but the "evil heart of unbelief" spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>, "in departing from the living God," now manifesting himself to his people in his Son? It is this animus characterizing the behaviour of the Galatian Churchmen which marks its essential difference as compared with that observance of "days" and "meats" which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. the apostle treats as a matter, relative to which Christians were to live in mutual tolerance. As long as a Christian continued to feel his relation to the Lord Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6-9</a>), it mattered not much if he thought it desirable to observe the Jewish sabbath or to abstain from eating animal food. He might, indeed, make himself thereby chargeable with spiritual unwisdom; the apostle clearly thought he would; but if he still held fast by Christ as the sole and all-sufficing Source to him of righteousness before God and of spiritual life, he was to be received and welcomed as a brother, without being vexed by interference with these foolish tenets of his. It became different when his care for such really indifferent externals took his heart away from a satisfied adherence to the Lord; then his ceremonialism or asceticism became rank and even fatal heresy. And this was what the apostle was fearing on behalf of his once so greatly cherished disciples in Galatia. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-11 The happy change whereby the Galatians were turned from idols to the living God, and through Christ had received the adoption of sons, was the effect of his free and rich grace; they were laid under the greater obligation to keep to the liberty wherewith he had made them free. All our knowledge of God begins on his part; we know him because we are known of him. Though our religion forbids idolatry, yet many practise spiritual idolatry in their hearts. For what a man loves most, and cares most for, that is his god: some have their riches for their god, some their pleasures, and some their lusts. And many ignorantly worship a god of their own making; a god made all of mercy and no justice. For they persuade themselves that there is mercy for them with God, though they repent not, but go on in their sins. It is possible for those who have made great professions of religion, to be afterwards drawn aside from purity and simplicity. And the more mercy God has shown, in bringing any to know the gospel, and the liberties and privileges of it, the greater their sin and folly in suffering themselves to be deprived of them. Hence all who are members of the outward church should learn to fear and to suspect themselves. We must not be content because we have some good things in ourselves. Paul fears lest his labour is in vain, yet he still labours; and thus to do, whatever follows, is true wisdom and the fear of God. This every man must remember in his place and calling.</body></html>
