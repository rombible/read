We miss the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, to express the idea of <span class="accented">immanence</span> which is evidently intended, and to express which <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is elsewhere found present; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:8</a>. The arrangement given in form <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is, in addition, greatly embarrassed by the "then" standing so far on in the sentence - this particle marking, as it does, an inference from the sentence in the preceding verse. The furthest place in the sentence adduced by Winer ('Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 61) is the fourth word, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>. The fourth form presents by far the easiest construction. It seems strange, however, if this was the original text, that it came to be changed into shapes so much more difficult to construe. In the second form, the clause, "with freedom did Christ set us free," seems somewhat strangely phrased; but this iteration of the idea of freedom, marking the apostle's anxious insistance upon it, may have led the copyists to suspect an error of transcription, and thus have set them upon the endeavour to improve, as they thought, the text before them. The same anxious insistance upon an idea leads the apostle to a somewhat similar introduction of a clause which is almost a parenthesis, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5</a>, "By grace have ye been saved." It will be noticed that the variations in the text above noted make not the smallest difference in the main contents of thought. The same factors of thought are present in all. The further remarks now to be made will assume for their basis the second form of the text. <span class="accented">Wherefore</span>, <span class="accented">brethren</span>, <span class="accented">we are not a handmaid's children</span>, <span class="accented">but</span> children <span class="accented">of the freewoman.</span> This, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;</span> (Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) gathers up the result of the whole foregoing allegorical exposition, not that of its concluding portion only, as a basis for practical remark. "We are not a handmaid's children;" that is, "It is not a slave-girl that is our mother." The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, not because the apostle is thinking, as some imagine, of there being other handmaids besides Mosaism, as, for example, heathen ceremonialism; for the context points to only one slave-girl that can possibly answer to Hagar; but because he wishes by contrast to fasten attention upon the character of her who is our mother. Hence also there is no <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, as in ver. 28. "<span class="accented">But children</span> of the <span class="accented">freewoman</span>," or "of her who is free;" not defining what individual is our mother, but, who our mother is being now assumed as known, marking what her condition is. <span class="accented">With freedom did Christ set us free</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). 'This clause both justifies and explains the word "freewoman." Our mother is a freewoman, because all her children have been emancipated by Christ; and the nature of her freedom is likewise defined by the nature of his work. This sense is more directly asserted in the fourth form of the Greek text - "children of the freewoman by the freedom with which Christ set us free;" but it is in reality contained in the second. Christ's emancipating work was twofold: he at once, by his atonement, effected our deliverance from guilt, and by the manner of his death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>) disconnected his people from the ceremonial Law. The former aspect of his work is essential to the beneficial effect of the latter. The clear realization of the fact that he has effected our perfect reconciliation with God cuts up from its roots all desire even, that we should ourselves strive, either to make or to keep ourselves acceptable with God by obedience to a Law of positive ordinances; while we also must see that, as connected with a Crucified One, it is impossible that we can be in harmony with the Mosaic ritual. A desire to Judaize cannot eoexist with true faith in our crucified Redeemer. By affirming that Christ hath set us free, the apostle points, not merely to our release from real or fancied obligation to obey the Law of Moses, but also to our "joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have received reconciliation "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-11.htm">Romans 5:11</a>). <span class="accented">Stand fast</span>, <span class="accented">therefore.</span> According to this reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> standing alone receives its colour of reference from the context. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>. Here it means the steadfast holding to a whole-hearted assurance that in Christ Jesus our freedom is complete. <span class="accented">And do not again get held in a yoke of bondage.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> used (Herod., 2:121) literally of being caught and held fast by a man-trap; also figuratively of being entangled with perplexities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, Herod., 1:190), with a curse, or with guilt, or with arbitrary dicta of a teacher (see Liddell and Scott). The condition of a slave is described by the word "yoke," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "As many as are bond-servants under the yoke." And it was probably with this particular shade of meaning that St. Peter used the term at the conference at Jerusalem respecting the ceremonial Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>) - "a yoke which neither we nor our fathers had strength enough to bear;" referring to it, we may suppose, as slavery, not merely because obedience to it was difficult, but as being observed from a legalistic anxiety to approve one's self thereby to the Divine acceptance or to escape the Divine displeasure. This view of the passage explains how the apostle was able to use the word "again" of these Galatian converts. They had been once under the yoke of an "evil conscience;" but Christ had come to them also, who were "afar off" in Gentile guiltiness, preaching peace, as he had come to them that were "nigh" in the Israelite covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>). But if they could not have "peace" and "access to the Father" save through conformity with Mosaic eeremonialism, then their "freedom" was forfeited; they sank back again into their former state of bondage. But see also the note on ver. 9. This exhortation to "stand fast" presupposes that they had not yet lapsed, but were only in danger of it (comp. the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:28-31 The history thus explained is applied. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free. If the privileges of all believers were so great, according to the new covenant, how absurd for the Gentile converts to be under that law, which could not deliver the unbelieving Jews from bondage or condemnation! We should not have found out this allegory in the history of Sarah and Hagar, if it had not been shown to us, yet we cannot doubt it was intended by the Holy Spirit. It is an explanation of the subject, not an argument in proof of it. The two covenants of works and grace, and legal and evangelical professors, are shadowed forth. Works and fruits brought forth in a man's own strength, are legal. But if arising from faith in Christ, they are evangelical. The first covenant spirit is of bondage unto sin and death. The second covenant spirit is of liberty and freedom; not liberty to sin, but in and unto duty. The first is a spirit of persecution; the second is a spirit of love. Let those professors look to it, who have a violent, harsh, imposing spirit, towards the people of God. Yet as Abraham turned aside to Hagar, so it is possible a believer may turn aside in some things to the covenant of works, when through unbelief and neglect of the promise he acts according to the law, in his own strength; or in a way of violence, not of love, towards the brethren. Yet it is not his way, not his spirit to do so; hence he is never at rest, till he returns to his dependence on Christ again. Let us rest our souls on the Scriptures, and by a gospel hope and cheerful obedience, show that our conversation and treasure are indeed in heaven.</body></html>
