It has reference, in the first instance, to the restoration of the exiled Jews to Jerusalem and to the coming greatness of the newly-settled city. Though at present it is desolate and in ruins, it shall become greater and more populous than ever it had been in its best days before. The revived theocracy under Zerubbabel is naturally taken as a type of the final theocratic reign of the Messiah. The representation of the theocracy under the figure of marriage is common, both in the prophetic writings and in St. Paul.<p><span class= "bld">Thou barren that bearest not.</span>--This was originally spoken of the revived condition of Jerusalem, in which for a long time no children had been born. Here it is applied to the despised and persecuted condition of the early Church.<p><span class= "bld">Break forth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> into singing. The phrase is expressed in full in the Authorised version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm" title="Sing, O barren, you that did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, said the LORD.">Isaiah 54:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The desolate. . . . she which hath an husband.</span>--In the original, Jerusalem after the exile, opposed to Jerusalem in the time of its prosperity under David and Solomon; in the typical application, Sarah, who had long been barren, as opposed to Hagar, whose marriage had been fruitful; in the anti-typical application, the new dispensation, Christianity, with its small beginnings, as opposed to the old dispensation, with its material possessions and privileges.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it is written</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>). The points indicated in the section of Isaiah (54.) referred to by the quotation which is made of the first verse, and which amply make good what the apostle has been stating and implying, are these: that a new economy was to appear; that by this economy a multitude of servants of God should be called into being; that this multitude should in numbers far surpass those called into being heretofore; that this economy, though newly manifested, had been in existence before, but comparatively unblest with offspring; that it was to be known as an economy of forgiving, adopting love, involving a principle of spiritual life and of spontaneous, no longer constrained and servile, obedience. We need not hesitate in asserting that the last-named features of the new economy were, in the apostle's view, included in the prediction he means to refer to, although not contained in those words of the prophet which he has expressly quoted. For it is one of the characteristics of a Jewish religious teacher's method of citing Scripture, noted by the learned Dr. Biesenthal, himself a Jew, in his 'Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews' ('Einleitung,' p. 54), that he is wont to omit in his express citation more or <span class="accented">less</span> of the passage referred to, leaving it to his hearer or reader to supply the omitted portions from his own knowledge, even when these are most material for the argument; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13, 14</a>, the" oath," fully recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>, is not itself contained in the citation made by the writer. The above-named, then, we may assume to have been points which the apostle regarded as contained in the passage he refers to, because they are contained in the section of which the cited words are an integral portion. Whatever may be thought of the applicability, <span class="accented">in a measure</span>, of the prophet's language in the section alluded to, to the case of Israel restored from the Babylonian captivity, yet that such an application furnishes no complete explanation of its import is clear from the circumstance that this jubilant prophesying follows immediately upon the delineation in the preceding chapter of the sufferings of Christ - a delineation which ended with the intimation of the results which should follow in the triumph over mighty powers opposing the Sufferer, and in the work of justification which he would accomplish upon "many" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10-12</a>). That the section was understood by our Lord to refer to the new economy which he was himself to introduce, is evidenced by his citing the words, "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord" (ver 13), as pointing to the spiritual illumination which should at the time referred to characterize the people of God universally, so universally that none would be numbered amongst God's true people, that is, amongst the disciples of his Son, who had not "heard from the Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>). We have, then, in this section of Isaiah a distinctly <span class="accented">predictive</span> description of a condition of spiritual well-being which was to result from Christ's mediation; that is, of the illumination, peace and joyful sense of God's love which then should be the "heritage of the servants of the Lord." This, construed in the apostle's imagery, connecting itself with that of the words which he expressly quotes, is the large multiplication of the children of the freewoman, bringing forth her offspring into a state of freedom and adoption in the great Father's family. The Greek rendering of the passage given by the apostle is identical with that of the Vatican text of the Septuagint. The Alexandrian text varies only in adding <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "and be glad," to the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "cry." apparently to explain what kind of crying out was intended<span class="cmt_word">. Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). The Authorized Version as well as the Revised thus renders the Greek here; but in the original passage in Isaiah the former renders, "that didst not bear." the Hebrew having the preterite indicative; and similarly, the "travailest not" in the next clause here is "didst not travail" there. The participles, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, may be classed with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-25.htm">John 9:25</a>, expressing the normal state <span class="accented">as hitherto known</span>, though just now subjected to a change. <span class="cmt_word">Break forth and cry, thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">that travailest not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">break forth and shout</span>, <span class="accented">thou that travailest not.</span> But the Hebrew has "break forth into singing" instead of "break forth and shout;" and so m <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-13.htm">Isaiah 49:13</a>; the word for "singing" denoting unarticulated cries of joy, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, and often.

It points in the present case to the solitary and unhappy condition of a woman "forsaken by her husband" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>). On the other hand, the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, render the one Hebrew word <span class="accented">be'ulah</span>, the passive participle of the verb <span class="accented">ba'al</span>, cohabit with. Compare the use of this verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24</a>. I ("married her," Authorized Version; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;</span>, Septuagint); <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-13.htm">Deuteronomy 21:13</a>, "and be her husband." The words, therefore, denote her that had her husband living with her as such; "hath," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-18.htm">John 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>. "The husband" is conceived of as belonging both to her and of right to the "desolate one." Perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> may be rendered "her husband." In the prophet's view, the "woman which had her husband" was the visible Israel, possessing the temple and the other tokens of the Lord's dwelling in her midst; the "desolate one" was the spiritual or the ideal Israel to be manifested in the future; for the present out of sight and seemingly in abeyance; but thereafter to he quickened into fertility by the inhabitation of the Lord (for he in the prophet's vision, ver. 5, is the Husband), revealed in his first suffering then glorified Servant as portrayed in the foregoing prophesying. So exactly do these two images correspond with "the Jerusalem that now is" and "the Jerusalem that is above," of the apostle's imagery, that his use of the prophet's words is plainly no mere accommodation to his purpose of language which was in reality alien to the subject, but is the citation of a passage regarded by him as strictly predictive, and therefore probative of the truth of his representation. The view of this prophecy of Isaiah found in Clemens Romanus, Ep. it., 'Ad Corinthians,' &sect; 2, and in Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' p. 88, which regards it as referring to the Gentile Church as contrasted with the Jewish, is plainly a misconception of its import: the rejoicing mother of the prophet, as well as the supernal Jerusalem of the apostle, knows of no distinction in her believing offspring, between Jew and Gentile, comprising both alike. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:21-27 The difference between believers who rested in Christ only, and those who trusted in the law, is explained by the histories of Isaac and Ishmael. These things are an allegory, wherein, beside the literal and historical sense of the words, the Spirit of God points out something further. Hagar and Sarah were apt emblems of the two different dispensations of the covenant. The heavenly Jerusalem, the true church from above, represented by Sarah, is in a state of freedom, and is the mother of all believers, who are born of the Holy Spirit. They were by regeneration and true faith, made a part of the true seed of Abraham, according to the promise made to him.</body></html>
