In like manner St. Paul speaks of the events which happened to the Israelites in their wanderings in the wilderness as happening "for our ensamples," or, more correctly, "by way of types or figures" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.">1Corinthians 10:11</a>): though elsewhere a distinction is drawn between "type" and "allegory," the first implying that the narrative on which it is based is true, the second that it is fictitious. St. Paul does not use the word here in this strict sense. The justification for the allegorical treatment of the patriarchal history may be expressed in the words of Calvin: "As the house of Abraham was at that time the true Church, so there can be no doubt that the chief and most memorable events which happened in it are so many types for us." At the same time, the argumentative force of the passage evidently rests upon the apostolic assertion of Christian liberty, not upon the logical cogency of the inference from the details of the type to the thing typified.<p><span class= "bld">These are the two covenants.</span>--"These," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>these women, Hagar and Sarah. "Are," in the sense of stand, for," "typically represent," as in the interpretation of the parable of the tares: "The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest <span class= "ital">is</span> the end of the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-39.htm" title="The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.">Matthew 13:39</a>); or, in the words of the institution of the Lord's Supper: "this <span class= "ital">is</span> my body . . . this <span class= "ital">is</span> my blood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-26.htm" title="And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.">Matthew 26:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>), where the meaning is really as little doubtful as here. "The two covenants" should be simply "two covenants." <span class= "ital">What</span> covenants the Apostle goes on to explain. So, too, "the one" in the next clause should be rather <span class= "ital">one.</span><p><span class= "bld">Which gendereth to bondage.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">bringing forth children unto bondage</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> unto a state of bondage, so that from the moment they are born they are subject to bondage. The progeny of Hagar is a nation of bondsmen, like the Jews under the old covenant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which things are an allegory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">which things are written</span> (or, <span class="accented">expounded</span>) <span class="accented">with a further meaning.</span> The relative <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f05;</span>, probably means "which facts, being of this description, are," etc., or, "things, which are of such a sort that they are," etc. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a> in the Greek). The apostle, perhaps, intimates that the particulars just recited by him belong to a class of objects distinguished among other objects presented to us in the Old Testament by having a further sense than the literal historical one; the literal historical sense, however, by no means being thereby superseded. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, "Now these things happened unto them (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) as figures [or, 'by way of figure ']." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is shown by lexicons, Liddell and Scott's and others, to mean, either to <span class="accented">speak</span> a thing allegorically or to <span class="accented">expound</span> a thing as allegorical. Bishops Ellicott and Lightfoot furnish passages illustrative of both meanings, particularly of the second; and the latter adds the observation that it is possible that the apostle uses the verb here in the sense of being allegorically expounded, "referring to some recognized mode of interpretation." St. Paul did at times refer to authority extrinsical to his own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-16.htm">1 Corinthians 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-11.htm">1 Corinthians 15:11</a>). But whichever of the two possible senses of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> was the one here intended by the apostle, there is no improbability in the supposition that not now for the first time was the narrative of Hagar and Ishmael thus applied: it is quite supposable, for instance, that it had been so applied at Antioch, in the animated discussions in which Paul, Barnabas, and Silas encountered the Judaists in that Church. At all events, it is not merely supposable, but in a high degree probable, that at least <span class="accented">some</span> of the historical personages, institutions, and events of the Old Testament Scriptures were wont to be allegorically treated by leaders of Christian thought of the highest authority. We cannot acquiesce in the position adopted by some critics, that such allegorizing is to be relegated to the region of mere Jewish rabbinism, now to be regarded as exploded. And we need not here insist upon the consideration that a rabbinical origin would constitute no valid objection to our acceptance of such allegorizing treatment of Scripture, because that the results of rabbinical exegesis and of rabbinical investigations in theology were in many cases of the highest value - a fact which those who are acquainted, for example, with Professor Reuss's 'Histoire de la Theologie Cbretienne' will not be disposed to question. For we resist the attempt to thrust us back upon the schools of the rabbins, as if it were from them only that St. Paul derived this allegorical method of Scripture exposition. Those schools may have made him acquainted with it, it is true; but altogether independently of rabbinical instruction, the leading teachers of the Church, even before Paul's conversion, "unlearned men," <span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as the rabbinists regarded them, had, as we cannot doubt, learnt thus to apply Scripture in the school of Jesus. Christ himself, not only before his passion, but also, and we may believe with greater definiteness and particularity, after his resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27, 45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>), had imparted to his apostles and other disciples <span class="accented">some</span> expositions of historical facts of the Old Testament, which must have been of this description, and which would suggest the legitimate application of the same method in other analogous instances. And those men were not only disciples, pupils of Jesus, but were likewise especial, though not the exclusive, organs of the Holy Spirit's teaching in the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>). Particular allegorical expositions, therefore, received amongst those apostles and prophets of Christ, came clothed with the highest authority, emanating as they well might have done from Christ's own oral teaching, or from an immediate special leading of his Spirit. And, further, we feel ourselves entitled to believe that the supreme Revealer of spiritual truth to mankind might well think fit to appoint, not only words or ceremonial institutions as means of imparting religious instruction or of prophetical indication, but historical incidents as well; not merely so ordering the manner in which his inspired organs framed their <span class="accented">narratives</span> of certain occurrences as to make those narratives prophetical, but also in his disposal of human affairs so ordering the occurrences themselves as that <span class="accented">they</span> should be prophetical; furnishing (so to speak) <span class="accented">tableaux vivants</span>, in which the faith of his servants should read, ff not spiritual facts which were as yet future, at least spiritual facts after they had come to <span class="accented">pass</span>, the prophetical adumbration of which, now recognized by them, would serve to confirm their belief in them and their comprehension of them. The fact that Christ repeatedly and most pointedly referred to the strange experiences of Jonah as prophetical of his own passion and resurrection proves to a certainty that events might be predictive as well as utterances of prophets. Our Lord's use of the story of the brazen serpent, of the gift of manna, and of the Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-16.htm">Luke 22:16</a>) points in the same direction. We have also apostolical guidance in construing the Passover, the Exodus, the story of Melehiscdec, Abraham's offering up of his son, the yearly Fast of the Atonement, as legitimately subject to similar treatment. Since the old economy with its histories and its ordinances originated from the same Divine Author as the new, it is no unreasonable belief that in the things of preparatory dispensations he had set foreshadowings, and in no scant number, of those great things in the spiritual economy which from "eternal ages" had been his thoughts towards us, and in which the whole progress of human history was to find its consummation. In the apostle's discussion of his subject there are in part distinctly specified, in part merely indicated, a great variety of contrasts; these the reader will find presented by Bengel in his 'Gnomon' in a tabulated form with great distinctness. For these are the two covenants; or, <span class="accented">testaments</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">for these women are two covenants.</span> The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. but the article is expunged by all recent editors. What the apostle means is this: the circumstance that Abraham had two wives pointed to the fact that there were to be, not one covenant only, but two. He has previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15, 17</a>) spoken of "<span class="accented">the</span> promise" as a covenant; while also this term was already a familiar designation of the economy which God appointed to the natural "seed of Abraham." Compare also Jeremiah's mention of these two "<span class="accented">covenants"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>). For the use of the verb "<span class="accented">are</span>," <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-37.htm">Matthew 13:37-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>.

The apostle assumes it to be a manifest fact, having before repeatedly asserted it, that those under the Law are in a condition of servitude. <span class="cmt_word">Which is Hagar</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>); <span class="accented">which is Hagar.</span> The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> here is, "which being such in character as it is, is Hagar." This covenant, with its children, being wrapped in an element of slavery, is kindred in character with Hagar and her offspring. It is objected that Ishmael was not, in fact, a slave. But as Hagar does not appear to have been a recognized concubine of Abraham, in the same way as Bilhah and Zilpah were concubines of Jacob, but still continued to be Sarah's handmaid ("thy maid," <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-6.htm">Genesis 16:6</a>), her child was, of course, born into the same condition. With Sarah's consent, it is true, Abraham might, if he had thought fit, have <span class="accented">adopted</span> him as a child of his own; but this does not appear to have been done. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:21-27 The difference between believers who rested in Christ only, and those who trusted in the law, is explained by the histories of Isaac and Ishmael. These things are an allegory, wherein, beside the literal and historical sense of the words, the Spirit of God points out something further. Hagar and Sarah were apt emblems of the two different dispensations of the covenant. The heavenly Jerusalem, the true church from above, represented by Sarah, is in a state of freedom, and is the mother of all believers, who are born of the Holy Spirit. They were by regeneration and true faith, made a part of the true seed of Abraham, according to the promise made to him.</body></html>
