In signification, this <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be admired, is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be congratulated, and was illustrated in the first note on ver. 17, especially by the reference to Aristophanes, 'Nubes,' 1188. <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "to be objects of admiration when I am present with you," is manifestly a recital of the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "the gratulation of yourselves," of ver. 15. The vivid remembrance of the simple-hearted joy and frank sympathy with each other's happiness of those days comes back to the apostle's mind with fresh force, after his brief mention and rebuke of the false-hearted gratulations and compliments by which they were now in danger of being ensnared. With a gentle reprehension of their levity, in that they were now bartering that former well-founded happiness for this later poor gratification of being recipients of mere false flattery, he yearns to bring them back to what they were so senselessly casting away, and that they should hold it fast, a stable joy, whether he was with them or not. This would be the case if "Christ were truly formed in them." The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;</span>, "in what is good," is similar to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-4.htm">John 7:4</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>). The sphere in which this admiring felicitation acts must be "what is good;" here that highest good which these Galatians were in danger of losing, if, indeed, they possessed it - being, and knowing themselves to be, sons of God. It is a doubtful point whether ver. 19 should be conjoined with this present verse, with a colon between vers. 19 and 20, and a comma only at the end of ver. 18; or whether the sentences should be separated as they appear in our Authorized Version. But at all events, the earnest, anxious, tender affectionateness which, as it were, wrings the apostle's heart in writing ver. 19, is to be felt already working in his soul in the writing of this eighteenth verse. The sense above given to the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, though disallowed by Alford and Bishops Ellicott and Lightfoot, appears to be that recognized by the Greek commentators Chrysostom and Theophylact. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-18 The apostle desires that they would be of one mind with him respecting the law of Moses, as well as united with him in love. In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zeal was better maintained.</body></html>
