(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>, "Ye are come to . . . the heavenly Jerusalem;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>, "the holy city, new Jerusalem." This "new" or "heavenly" Jerusalem is the seat or centre of the glorified Messianic kingdom, just as the old Jerusalem had been the centre of the earthly theocracy. The conception of the "heavenly Jerusalem" among the Jews, like the rest of their Messianic beliefs, took a materialistic form. It was to be a real but gorgeous city suspended in mid-air, "three parasangs" (11� miles) above the earthly city. Sometimes it is regarded as the exact copy of its earthly counterpart, and at other times as forming a perfect square. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm" title="And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.">Revelation 21:16</a>.) No such materialistic notions attach to the idea as presented by St. Paul. "Jerusalem which is above" is to him a spiritual city, of which the Christian is a member here and now. It is part of the Messianic kingdom, to the whole of which the Apostle gave an ideal character. He could not but do so, seeing that the kingdom began with the coming of its King, though there was no earthly and visible realisation of it. The Christian "conversation" (or, rather, <span class= "ital">commonwealth,</span> the constitution that he was under) was "in heaven," while he himself was upon earth. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Which is the mother of us all.</span>--The true reading is, undoubtedly, <span class= "ital">which is our mother,</span> omitting "all."

For the word "above," <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1, 2</a>, "Seek the things that are above (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>) where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God: set your mind on the things that are above; your life is hid with Christ in God;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>, "Our citizenship (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is in heaven." This is identical with the "heavenly Jerusalem" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>, which, standing in contrast with the "mount that might be touched and that burned with fire," Sinai with its soul-crushing terrors, appears associated with the pacifying blood of Jesus, and with communion with all that is holiest and most glorious. The essential identity of the contrast in the two passages, which are mutually illustrative, bespeaks a common origin in one and the same mind. The supernal Jerusalem is not chiefly contrasted with the Jerusalem "that now is," in point of time: she is not the future only, though in the future to be <span class="accented">manifested -</span> the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down (as St. John writes) from God out of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>); but she <span class="accented">is</span> there <span class="accented">now</span>, with God. It would be in harmony with St. Paul's representation to suppose that he conceives of her having been there with God in heaven of old, her citizens upon earth being the true servants of God in all ages. In former ages, however, she was comparatively barren; it needed that the enthronization of the God-Man, "the Mediator of the new covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>), on "God's holy hill of Zion," should take place before she could become the prolific mother here shown to us. Commentators refer to rabbinical speculations relative to a Jerusalem which was conceived of as existing in heaven, as illustrated by Schottgen's 'Dissertatio de Hierosol. Caelesti' ('Hor. Hebr.,' vol. 1. diss. 5.), and also by Wetstein both here and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. It would be interesting if we could determine when those rabbinical speculations first arose, and how far it may be judged probable that they or some earlier form of them out of which these sprang suggested anything to St. Paul for the form in which he clothed his own conception of this idea; there may have been such. Meanwhile, we cannot but be struck by the purely ideal and spiritual character in which the apostle here exhibits his conception of it; though something like a terrene manifestation in the future seems indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>. "Is free;" the counterpart of Sarah, as mentioned in vers. 22, 23. That this Jerusalem is free, the apostle feels it needless to state; she to his very consciousness is the very home and bosom of God's love, having her very existence, as well as her outward-acting power, in his pervading, actuating Spirit. Bondage, constraint, <span class="accented">there</span> cannot be; for all volitions are there harmonized, absorbed, by the Spirit of love uniting her component elements both with each other and with God. <span class="cmt_word">Which is the mother of us all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>]) <span class="accented">which is our mother.</span> Here again, as in ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> means "<span class="accented">which</span>, being such as she <span class="accented">is</span>, is our mother." We look at the Jerusalem that is above, and in her princely freedom we recognize what we her children are. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which the Textus Receptus has before <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and which is by the general consent of critics rejected, is with much probability supposed to have come into the text by the copyist's recollection of the similar sentence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16, 17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which there belongs to the essential thought of the context that God had made Abraham "the father of many nations," is unnecessary here, where the apostle is chiefly concerned with the freedom which characterizes the family of promise. If documentary evidence proved it to be genuine, it would find its justification in the notion of the fruitfulness which now at length, as the apostle presently shows, is given to the supernal Jerusalem. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:21-27 The difference between believers who rested in Christ only, and those who trusted in the law, is explained by the histories of Isaac and Ishmael. These things are an allegory, wherein, beside the literal and historical sense of the words, the Spirit of God points out something further. Hagar and Sarah were apt emblems of the two different dispensations of the covenant. The heavenly Jerusalem, the true church from above, represented by Sarah, is in a state of freedom, and is the mother of all believers, who are born of the Holy Spirit. They were by regeneration and true faith, made a part of the true seed of Abraham, according to the promise made to him.</body></html>
