Bishop Lightfoot writes, "<span class="accented">But</span>, speaking of my presence, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">would I had been present</span>," etc. But this explanation is not necessary. The imperfect verb <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, like the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-22.htm">Acts 25:22</a> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, denotes a movement as it were which had just been stirring in the mind, but which for good reasons is now withdrawn: "I could almost wish - but long distance and pressure of other duties make it impossible." Thus much in explanation of the withdrawal of the wish. The wish itself was occasioned by the feeling that the yearning desire of his soul might perhaps be more likely to be achieved if, by being on the spot, he were enabled to adapt his treatment to a more distinct consciousness of the circumstances than he can possibly now have. "To be present with you;" the very words are repeated from ver. 18. It was well both with you and with me when I was with you: would that I could be with van now I (On <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,," this very hour," see note on ch. 1:9.) <span class="cmt_word">And to change my voice</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The tense of the infinitive <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> hardly allows us to take the word as meaning "from moment to moment according to the rapidly varying emergencies." This would have been expressed rather by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The question then arises - Change: from what to what? to which a great variety of answers have been proposed. The clue is probably supplied in the words, "be present with you this very hour." This <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, contrasting as it does the very present with the former occasions on which the apostle had been with them, suggests that he meant that the tone of his utterance would need to be different if amongst them just now from what it had then been. Then, it was the simple, un-anxious, joyous, exposition of the blessed gospel, untrammelled by fear of being misunderstood; such a way of speaking as one would be naturally drawn on to pursue who found himself addressing those whom he could confide in, and who were disposed frankly and lovingly, with an honest and good heart, to drink in from his lips the simple faith. Perhaps he might now find it necessary to replace that mode of utterance by guarded words, by stern reasoning, by the refuting of wilful misconceptions, by exposing and abashing cavil and objection. <span class="cmt_word">For I stand in doubt of you</span>; or, I <span class="accented">am perplexed for you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">am perplexed about you.</span> Compare <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "I am in good courage concerning you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-16.htm">2 Corinthians 7:16</a>). As "<span class="accented">in"</span> the Corinthians the apostle found ground for good courage, so "in" the Galatians he found ground for perplexity. This explains his wishing that he were with them. He would in that case be less unable to clearly understand their state of mind. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19,20 The Galatians were ready to account the apostle their enemy, but he assures them he was their friend; he had the feelings of a parent toward them. He was in doubt as to their state, and was anxious to know the result of their present delusions. Nothing is so sure a proof that a sinner has passed into a state of justification, as Christ being formed in him by the renewal of the Holy Spirit; but this cannot be hoped for, while men depend on the law for acceptance with God.</body></html>
