The same history had been already allegorically treated by Philo. The treatment of it by St. Paul is, however, quite different, and in keeping with the line of argument followed in the context.<p>The points of parallelism, which are drawn out in much detail, may be exhibited thus:--<p><span class= "ital">Jewish Church.</span><p><span class= "ital">Christian Church.</span><p>The bondwoman, Hagar.<p>The freewoman, Sarah.<p>Son of the bondwoman, Ishmael.<p>Son of the freewoman, Isaac.<p>Natural birth (the flesh).<p>Supernatural birth (the promise).<p>Mount Sinai.<p>Mount Zion.<p>The Law.<p>The Promise.<p>The earthly Jerusalem.<p>The heavenly Jerusalem.<p>Enslaved.<p>Free.<p>Fruitful.<p>Barren.<p>Small offspring.<p>Large offspring.<p>Persecuting.<p>Persecuted.<p>Expulsion.<p>Inheritance.<p><span class= "ital">The Jewish Church is enslaved.</span><p><span class= "ital">The Christian Church is free.</span><p>(21) <span class= "bld">Ye that desire to be under the law.</span>--A direct appeal to those who were inclined to give way to the Judaising party.<p><span class= "bld">Do ye not hear</span> <span class= "bld">the law?</span>--"Hear" is probably to be taken in the sense of "give heed to," "listen to with attention," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-14.htm" title="And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.">Matthew 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-9.htm" title="Who has ears to hear, let him hear.">Matthew 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-13.htm" title="Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.">Matthew 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-29.htm" title="Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.">Luke 16:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-31.htm" title="And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.">Luke 16:31</a>. Some have thought that it merely refers to the practice of reading a lesson from the Old Testament, which was adopted into the Christian Church from the synagogue.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). After the outburst of affectionate earnestness expressed in the last four verses, the apostle seems to have paused, reflecting in what way he could the most effectually convince these Galatian legalists of their error. At length, a consideration occurs to him, which he impetuously so to speak hastens to abruptly sot before them. He has before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>) shown to the Galatian believers that they were "Abraham's seed." He now means to show that, as children of Abraham through faith in Christ, they stood on a far higher footing than the children of the Sinai covenant did - a position which, by subjecting themselves afresh to the Law, they would forego. The verb "desire" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), as here introduced, intimates that this aspiration of theirs was a mere freak of self-will, there being nothing in the circumstances to prompt it. So in ver. 9, "Ye desire to be in bondage." In consequence of there being no article with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, some would render <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> "under Law," that is, Law viewed <span class="accented">in</span> g<span class="accented">enere</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>. But the whole scope of the Epistle resists this view. The apostle's contention with the Galatian perverters of the truth is not concerning Christians being subject to Law absolutely, but concerning their being subject to a Law of outward ceremonial observance; that is, to the Law of Moses; for there was no other system of positive ordinances by which, as of Divine authority, they could imagine themselves to be bound. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used without the article, like other <span class="accented">monadic</span> nouns with an understood specific reference (for examples, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as it is also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5, 6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Do ye not hear the Law?</span> (<span class="greek_word">to\n no/mon</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>;); <span class="accented">to that Law give ye no heed</span>? The article is here prefixed to <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to make the repetition of the noun the more telling; just as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, hear, like our "listen to," means "take to heart what it says;" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-29.htm">Luke 16:29, 31</a>. There is no reason for attributing to the verb such a sense of listening to an <span class="accented">oral</span> utterance as should warrant us in supposing, that the apostle is thinking in particular of the Galatian Christians as in the habit of "hearing" the Pentateuch and ether Old Testament Scriptures read, whether in Jewish synagogues (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>) or in Christian assemblages. That such Scriptures in the Septuagint Version were customarily read aloud when Christians assembled for united worship, especially in the absence or dearth of other inspired writings, is more than probable: we know from Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 1. p. 83) that such was the custom from Sunday to Sunday in his days, when there were <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> also available for such use. Moreover, the existence of such a custom helps us to understand how it was that the apostle could here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>, presuppose with Christian believers an acquaintance with the contents of the Pentateuch. But we require more here than the thought, "Are ye not wont to hear the Law read?" It is rather an acquaintance with its contents, and taking due account of them, that he demands of his readers. Some uncial manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, read, instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. This reading of the text would only imply, not without a touch of sarcasm, the sense which the more accredited reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, may be understood as directly denoting. The use of the word "Law" to denote at once the system of Mosaic legislation and the historical record in which it is embedded, is remarkable. The Jews were accustomed to designate the Pentateuch by this term (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>); and whoever would fain subject themselves to the positive enactments of the Mosaic Law as possessing Divine authority, would of course feel themselves bound also to accept the teaching of the historical record as clothed with the like authority. The apostle himself also accepted both as alike coming from God; only he required that the Divine purpose in both should be clearly understood and be suitably complied with. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:21-27 The difference between believers who rested in Christ only, and those who trusted in the law, is explained by the histories of Isaac and Ishmael. These things are an allegory, wherein, beside the literal and historical sense of the words, the Spirit of God points out something further. Hagar and Sarah were apt emblems of the two different dispensations of the covenant. The heavenly Jerusalem, the true church from above, represented by Sarah, is in a state of freedom, and is the mother of all believers, who are born of the Holy Spirit. They were by regeneration and true faith, made a part of the true seed of Abraham, according to the promise made to him.</body></html>
