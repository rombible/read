It has been suggested that they have reference to a special code current in Galatia. It is, however, far more probable that the Apostle is referring exclusively to neither, but has in his mind a sort of abstraction of the law of minority, such as would present itself to one who had not himself had a legal education.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now I</span> <span class= "bld">say.</span>--This phrase introduces a further and fuller explanation of what is involved in the state of nonage, as compared with that of adult freedom.<p><span class= "bld">A child</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> an infant, a minor; though the term <span class= "ital">is</span> not technically chosen.<p><span class= "bld">Differeth nothing from a servant.</span>--Both the child and the slave were incapable of any valid act in a legal sense; the guardian was as entirely the representative of the one as the master of the other. Both the child and the slave were subject to the same restraint, discipline, correction.<p><span class= "bld">Though he be lord of all.</span>--Strictly speaking, the inference from this would be that the father was dead. This, however, is a point that does not really enter into the Apostle's thoughts. The illustration does not hold good in <span class= "ital">all</span> particulars, but in the <span class= "ital">chief</span> particulars--viz., the state of constraint and subordination in which the minor is placed so long as he is a minor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now I say</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). A form of expression usual with the apostle when introducing a new statement designed either to explain or elucidate something before said (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>, according to the Received Text; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>. So <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>). It is intended apparently to quicken attention: "Now I wish to say this." In the present case the apostle designs to throw further light upon the position taken in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, that God's people, while under the Law, were under a bondage from which they have now been emancipated. Compare the somewhat similar process of illustration adopted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2-4</a>. In both passages it is not a logical demonstration that is put forward, but an illustratively analogous case in human experience. A metaphor, though not strictly an argument, yet frequently helps the reader to an intuitive perception of the justness of the position laid down. <span class="cmt_word">That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">so long as the heir is a child</span>, <span class="accented">he differeth nothing from a bondservant</span>, <span class="accented">though he is lord of all.</span> The article before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, heir, is the class article, as before <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, mediator (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm">Galatians 3:20</a>) - "an heir." In the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> the apostle evidently has in view one who as yet is in his nonage - as in English law phrase, "an infant." In Roman law language, <span class="accented">infans</span> is a child under seven, the period of minority reaching to twenty-five. In Attic Greek, the correlate to one registered amongst "men" was a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. It does not appear that the apostle means to use a technical legal expression. He contrasts <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>. "Differeth nothing from a bond-servant;" <span class="accented">i.e. </span> is nothing better than a bond-servant, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-31.htm">Matthew 10:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-12.htm">Matthew 12:12</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> seems used only in the sense of your differing from another to your advantage, so that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> are things that are more excellent. "Lord," "proprietor;" the title to the property inheres in him, though he is not yet fit to handle it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The apostle deals plainly with those who urged the law of Moses together with the gospel of Christ, and endeavoured to bring believers under its bondage. They could not fully understand the meaning of the law as given by Moses. And as that was a dispensation of darkness, so of bondage; they were tied to many burdensome rites and observances, by which they were taught and kept subject like a child under tutors and governors. We learn the happier state of Christians under the gospel dispensation. From these verses see the wonders of Divine love and mercy; particularly of God the Father, in sending his Son into the world to redeem and save us; of the Son of God, in submitting so low, and suffering so much for us; and of the Holy Spirit, in condescending to dwell in the hearts of believers, for such gracious purposes. Also, the advantages Christians enjoy under the gospel. Although by nature children of wrath and disobedience, they become by grace children of love, and partake of the nature of the children of God; for he will have all his children resemble him. Among men the eldest son is heir; but all God's children shall have the inheritance of eldest sons. May the temper and conduct of sons ever show our adoption; and may the Holy Spirit witness with our spirits that we are children and heirs of God.</body></html>
