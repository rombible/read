St. Paul seems to have suffered from grievous bodily infirmity, which he elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>) describes as a "thorn (or rather, <span class= "ital">stake</span>) in the flesh." The effects of this were seen in his personal appearance, which his enemies described as "mean" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.">2Corinthians 10:10</a>); and he himself felt it as a corrective against any tendency to spiritual pride (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>). An attack of this malady came upon him during his visit to Galatia, and it was with health shattered by this that he first preached the gospel to the Galatians. Still, to their credit, they took no notice of it, and gave him the warmest possible reception. As to the nature of the malady referred to, see Notes on 2 Corinthians 12.<p><span class= "bld">Despised not, nor rejected.</span>--The second of these two words is stronger than would appear from the English version. It is used of the expression of physical disgust: <span class= "ital">ye despised not, nor loathed.</span> The Apostle says that the Galatians did not despise "their temptation," meaning "the thing (malady) which they were tempted to despise."<p><span class= "bld">Even as Christ Jesus.</span>--You showed to the ambassador of Christ as much enthusiasm, as deep and ardent an affection, as you could have shown to Christ Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And my temptation which was in my flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) <span class="accented">i and that which was a temptation for you in my flesh.</span> "In my flesh;" that is, in my bodily appearance.

"My trial "would add to the sentence a tinge of pathetic self-commiseration. "Your trial" brings out the sentiment how greatly his affliction would be likely to indispose his hearers to listen to his message; it "tested" very severely the sincerity and depth of their religious sensibility. <span class="cmt_word">Ye despised not, nor rejected</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">ye scorned not</span>, <span class="accented">nor loathed.</span> The disfigurement on the apostle's person, whatever it was, did not detain their attention; they did not, at least not long, occupy themselves with indulging their feelings of ridicule or disgust; their sense of it got to be soon absorbed in their admiration of the apostle's character and in their delight in the heavenly message which he brought to them. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, in the New Testament found only in St. Luke and St. Paul, means always, not merely "to despise," but to <span class="accented">express</span> contempt for a thing, "to scout" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm">Luke 23:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-28.htm">1 Corinthians 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20</a>). Grotius observes of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> that it is a figurative expression drawn from our spitting out of our mouth what greatly offends our taste; quoting Catullus ('Carm.' 50, 'Ad Lic.'): "Precesque nostras, Oramus, ne despuas." Critics have remarked that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is not found elsewhere used thus metaphorically as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is, is probably so applied here by the apostle to produce a kind of alliteration after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: as if it were "Non reprobastis, nec <span class="accented">respuistis."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>But received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">but as an angel of God received ye me</span>, <span class="accented">as Christ Jesus.</span> Their first feeling of aversation from his personal appearance gave place to emotions of delight in his message of which he seemed as it were the embodiment, and of reverential love and gratitude to himself. His manifest absorption in the glad tidings he brought, and in love to his Lord, irradiating his whole being with <span class="accented">his</span> unbounded benevolence and gladsomeness as the messenger of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>), was recognized by them with a response of unspeakable enthusiasm. A faint parallel is afforded by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-18 The apostle desires that they would be of one mind with him respecting the law of Moses, as well as united with him in love. In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zeal was better maintained.</body></html>
