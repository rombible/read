This is a wailing remonstrance against an apprehended incipient state of alienation. "So then," <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (see note on ver. 7), occurs repeatedly before an imperative; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>; here only before a question. Its consecutive import here lies in the essential identification between their attachment to St. Paul and their allegiance to the pure gospel. If they forsook the gospel, their heart was gone from <span class="accented">him.</span> Naturally also their incipient defection from the truth was accompanied by a jealousy on their part hew he would regard them, and by a preparedness to listen to those who spoke of him, as Judaizers everywhere did, with disparagement and dislike. No doubt the accounts which had just reached him of the symptoms showing themselves among them of defection from the gospel, and which prompted the immediate despatch of this Epistle, had informed him also of symptoms of a commencing aversation from himself. The construction of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the Textus Receptus of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>, which is perfectly good Greek, even though the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> must be removed from the text as not genuine. The verb "I am become" describes the now produced result of the action expressed by the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "dealing according to truth" - an action which has been continuous to the present hour and is still going on. If the apostle were referring only to something which had taken place at his second visit, he would have probably used different tenses; either, perhaps, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> - compare <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a> (or with a contemporaneous aorist participle, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">or</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3</a>. As it stands, "<span class="accented">dealing</span> with you according to truth" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) expresses the apostle's continuous declaration of the gospel, and his never-flinching ins]stance upon the mortal danger of defection from it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); and "I am become your enemy" points to the result now manifesting itself from this steadfast attitude of his, in consequence of their <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of meriting his disapproval. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> occurs only once in the Septuagint - in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-16.htm">Genesis 42:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>, "Whether there be any truth in you" (Authorized Version and Hebrew); and once besides in the New Testament - in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span>, where the verb denotes, apparently, not merely being truthful in speech, but the whole habit of addiction both to uprightness and to God's known truth; for we can hardly leave out of our view this latter idea, when we consider how frequently the apostle designates the gospel by the term "the truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-8.htm">2 Corinthians 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10, 12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). "Enemy" is either one regarded as adopting a hostile position to them, or one viewed with hostile feeling by them, which latter is its sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>. The above exposition of the import of this verse is confirmed by the consideration that the Epistle affords no trace of the apostle's relations with the Galatian converts having been other than mutually friendly at even his second visit to them. This fact is implied in ver. 12, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a> furnishes no evidence to the contrary; for those warnings may have been uttered in his first visit as well as in his second, without occasioning or being occasioned by any want of mutual confidence. This view of their mutual relations is confirmed likewise by the feelings of indignant astonishment with which evidently the apostle took up his pen to address them in this letter: the tidings which had just reached him had been a painful surprise to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-18 The apostle desires that they would be of one mind with him respecting the law of Moses, as well as united with him in love. In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zeal was better maintained.</body></html>
