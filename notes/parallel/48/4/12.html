I have no complaint to make against you. You remember the illness which detained me among you, and led me first to preach to you the gospel. You received me kindly and warmly enough <span class= "ital">then,</span> though my bodily infirmities might well have tempted you to despise me. You treated me as if I had been a messenger direct from heaven. You thought yourselves "blest" by my teaching. You would have done anything for me; you would have given me even your eyes. What has become of all this now? Why do you consider yourselves "blest" no more? Why do you treat me as an enemy, merely for telling you the truth?<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Be as I am.</span>--Use the same Christian freedom that I use.<p><span class= "bld">For I am as ye are.</span>--I lay no stress on my pure Jewish descent. I claim no privileges because I was circumcised the eighth day. I do not count myself holier than you because I belonged to the strictest of all sects, the Pharisees. I stripped myself of all this, and became a Gentile among Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">Ye have not injured me at all.</span>--Ye <span class= "ital">did me no wrong.</span> There is a transition of subject at this clause. The Apostle goes back in thought to his first visit to Galatia. He had no complaint to make of the Galatians then. They did him no injury, showed him no unkindness, but, on the contrary, received him gladly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am</span>; <span class="cmt_word">for I am as ye are</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; <span class="accented">be ye as I</span>; <span class="accented">because I on my part an as ye</span>; <span class="accented">brethren</span>, <span class="accented">I entreat.</span> We may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>, "Be imitators of me, even as on my part I am of Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)."

"Be as I;" to wit, rejoicing in Christ Jesus as our sole and all-sufficing Righteousness before God, and in that faith letting go all care about rites and ceremonies of the Law of Moses, or indeed ceremonialism of any kind, as if such things mattered at all here, in the business of being well-pleasing to God, whether done or forborne. "Because I on my part am as ye." I, a born Jew, once a zealous worker - out of legal ceremonial righteousness, have put that aside, and have placed myself on the footing of a mere Gentile, content to live like a Gentile (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>), trusting in Christ like as any Gentile has to de who was bare alike of Jewish prerogative and of ceremonial righteousness. This "for" or "because" is an appeal to them for loving sympathy and fellow-working. What was to become of him if <span class="accented">Gentiles</span> withheld from him <span class="accented">their</span> practical sympathy with his religious life? To what other quarter could he look for it? From Jewish sympathy he was an utter outcast. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "brethren, I entreat," comes in here as a breathing forth of intense imploring. And a remarkable instance is here afforded of that abrupt, instantaneous transition in the expression of feeling which is one great characteristic of St. Paul when writing in one of his more passionate moods. Compare for this the flexure of passionate feeling prevailing through the tenth and three following chapters of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. Just before, in this chapter, vers. 8-11, the language has been that of stern upbraiding, and, indeed, as if <span class="accented">de haut en bas</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> from one who from the high level of Israelite pre-eminence was addressing those who quite recently were mere outcast heathens. But here he seems suddenly caught and carried away by a flood of passionate emotion of another kind. The remembrance comes to his soul of his own former sorrows, when he "<span class="accented">suffered</span> the <span class="accented">less</span> of all things," as he so pathetically tells the Philippians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-14</a>); when in the working out of his own salvation, and that of the Gentiles to whom he had been appointed to minister, he had cut himself off from all that he had once prized, and from all the attachments of kindred and party and nation. A terrible rending had it been for him when he had ceased to be a Jew; his <span class="accented">flesh</span> still quivered at the recollection, though his <span class="accented">spirit</span> rejoiced in Christ Jesus. And now this mood of feeling prompts him to cast himself almost as it were at the feet of these Gentile converts, adjuring them not to turn away from him, not to bereave him of <span class="accented">their</span> fellowship and sympathy. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">have not injured me at all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">no wrong have ye done me.</span> This commences a new sentence, which runs on through the next three verses. The apostle is anxious to remove from their minds the apprehension that he was offended with them on the ground of unkindness shown by them towards himself. It was true that he had been writing to them in strong terms of displeasure and indignation; but this was altogether on account of their behaviour towards the gospel, not at all on account of any injury that he had himself to complain cf. He is well aware of the virulent operation of the sentiment expressed by the old maxim, "Odimus quos laesimus;" and is therefore eager and anxious to take its sting out of the mutual relations between himself and them. When the apostle is writing under strong emotion, the connecting links of thought are frequently difficult to discover; and this is the case here. But this seems to be the thread of connection: the Galatian Christians would not be ready to accord him any sympathetic compliance with his entreaty that they would "<span class="accented">be as</span> he <span class="accented">was</span>," if they thought he entertained towards them sentiments of soreness or resentment on personal grounds. There was no reason, he tells them, why they should; they had done him no wrong. There is no reason for supposing that the time of the action referred to in <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is identical with that indicated by the aorists of the two next verses. From the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "the first time," in ver. 13, it is clear, as critics have generally felt, that there had been a second visit after that one. If so, a disclaimer of offence taken during the first visit would not have obviated the suspicion of offence taken during a later one. The aorist of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> must, therefore, cover the whole period of intercourse. Perhaps thus: whatever wrong you may suspect me of charging you with, be assured I do not charge you with it; there was no personal affront then offered me. In what follows, it is true, he dwells exclusively upon the enthusiastic demonstration which they made of their personal attachment to him when he first visited them; but though the assertion here made is not to its full extent proved good by the particulars given in vers. 13 and 14, and though the enthusiasm of personal kindness there described must, under the circumstances, have very considerably abated; yet, very supposably, nothing may have occurred since then - nothing, for example, during his second visit - which would show that they now disowned those feelings of love and respect. At all events, he refuses to allow that there had. No personal affront had he to complain of; while, on the other hand, their former intense kindness had laid up as it were a fund of responsive affection and gratitude in his bosom which could not be soon exhausted. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:12-18 The apostle desires that they would be of one mind with him respecting the law of Moses, as well as united with him in love. In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zeal was better maintained.</body></html>
