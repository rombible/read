In their old heathen state they had been in bondage to gods that were no gods. From this bondage they had been delivered. They had been raised to a true knowledge of God, and received a Father's recognition from Him. How then could they possibly think of returning to a system of mere ceremonialism. All this painful observance of times and seasons could only make the Apostle think that his labours on their behalf had been thrown away.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Them which by nature are no gods.</span>--The gods of the heathen are called by St. Paul "devils." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20</a> : "The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils, and not to God.")<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>); a strongly adversative conjunction, belonging to the whole sentence comprised in this and the next verse, which are closely welded together by the particles <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. In contravention of God's work of grace just described, they were renouncing their sonship and making themselves slaves afresh. Then (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>). The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, with its balancing <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, here, as often is the case, unites together sentences not in their main substance strictly adverse to each other, but only in subordinate details contrasted, of which we have an exemplary instance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. In such cases we have often no resource in English but to leave the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> untranslated, as our Authorized Version commonly does; "indeed" or "truly," for example, would be more or less misleading. The truth is, the apostle in these two verses is heaping reproach upon the Galatian Judaizers; first, in this verse, for their former (guilty) ignorance of God and their idolatries, and then, in the next verse, for their slighting that blessed friendship with God which they owed only to his preventing grace. In dealing with Gentile Christians the apostle repeatedly is found referring to their former heathenism, for the purpose of enforcing humility or abashing presumption, as for example in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13, 17</a>. In the case of the Galatians his indignation prompts him to use a degree of outspoken severity which he was generally disposed to forbear employing. The "then" is not defined, as English readers might perhaps misconstrue the Authorized Version as intending, by the following clause, "not knowing God," which in that version is "when ye knew not God" - a construction of the words which the use of the participle would hardly warrant; rather the time referred to by the adverb is the time of which he has before been speaking, when God's people were under the pedagogy of the Law. This, though when compared with Christ's liberty a state of bondage, was, however (the apostle feels), a position of high advancement as compared with that of heathen idolaters. These last were "<span class="accented">far</span> off," while the Israelites were "<span class="accented">nigh"</span> (compare the <span class="accented">passages</span> just now referred to). During that time of legal pedagogy the Galatians and their forefathers, all in the apostle's view forming one class, were wallowing in the mire of heathenism. <span class="cmt_word">When ye knew not</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="greek_word">ou)k ei)do/te Qeo/n</span>); <span class="accented">ye knew not God and</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> "Knowing not God" describes the condition of heathens also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a>," Not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles which know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) God;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, "Rendering vengeance to them that know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) God." Both of these passages favour the view that the apostle does not in the least intend in the present clause to <span class="accented">excuse</span> the idolatries which he goes on to speak of, but rather to describe a condition of godlessness which, as being positive rather than merely negative, inferred utter pravity and guiltiness. He uses <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> with the participle here, in place of the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> in the two <span class="accented">passages c</span>ited from the <span class="accented">Thessalonians</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> intending to state an historical fact viewed absolutely - a sense which is made clear in English by substituting an indicative verb for the participle. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did service unto</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">served</span>; devoted yourselves to. The verb is, perhaps, used here in that milder sense in which it frequently occurs; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-29.htm">Luke 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. The Revised Version, however, gives "were in bondage to" in the present instance, but "serve" in the <span class="accented">passages now</span> cited. The aorist, instead of an imperfect, describes the form of religious life which they then led as a whole. <span class="cmt_word">Them which by nature are</span> <span class="cmt_word">no gods</span> (<span class="greek_word">toi = fu/sei mh\ ou = si</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, which would apparently mean "which arc not gods by nature, but only in your imagination;" like "There be that are called gods," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm">1 Corinthians 8:5</a> - Zeus, Apollo, Here, etc., mere figments of imagination (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>). The more approved reading suggests rather the idea that the objects they worshipped might not be non-existent, but were certainly not of a Divine nature; "by nature," that is, in the kind of being to which they belong (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; Wisd. 13:1, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The question may be asked - If they were not gods, what then were they? The apostle would probably have answered, "Demons;" for thus he writes to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>): "The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and not to God." Alford renders, "to gods which by nature exist not," etc.; but the more obvious sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is that of a copula merely (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-9.htm">2 Chronicles 13:9</a>, Septuagint, "He became a priest (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>)"). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:8-11 The happy change whereby the Galatians were turned from idols to the living God, and through Christ had received the adoption of sons, was the effect of his free and rich grace; they were laid under the greater obligation to keep to the liberty wherewith he had made them free. All our knowledge of God begins on his part; we know him because we are known of him. Though our religion forbids idolatry, yet many practise spiritual idolatry in their hearts. For what a man loves most, and cares most for, that is his god: some have their riches for their god, some their pleasures, and some their lusts. And many ignorantly worship a god of their own making; a god made all of mercy and no justice. For they persuade themselves that there is mercy for them with God, though they repent not, but go on in their sins. It is possible for those who have made great professions of religion, to be afterwards drawn aside from purity and simplicity. And the more mercy God has shown, in bringing any to know the gospel, and the liberties and privileges of it, the greater their sin and folly in suffering themselves to be deprived of them. Hence all who are members of the outward church should learn to fear and to suspect themselves. We must not be content because we have some good things in ourselves. Paul fears lest his labour is in vain, yet he still labours; and thus to do, whatever follows, is true wisdom and the fear of God. This every man must remember in his place and calling.</body></html>
