The "time" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) here most probably corresponds to the period terminated by the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: that is, it is the interval which God ordained should first elapse. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f69;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "When he was well-nigh forty years old;" literally," When there was being completed to him a time of forty years" (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-27.htm">Acts 24:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-57.htm">Luke 1:57</a>). The substantive (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) "completion" occurs in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>, "Dispensation of the completion of the times." The apostle might apparently have written <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "But when the term was completed;" but he prefers to express it in this particular form, as colouring the idea with a certain pathos of solemn joy at the arrival of a time so long expected, so fraught with blessing (compare the use of the verb "came" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-25.htm">Galatians 3:25</a>). Why the supreme Disposer, the Father of his people, chose that particular era in the history of the human race for his children's passing into their majority is a deeply interesting subject of inquiry. Much has been said, as for example by Neander and Guerieke in their Histories of the Church, and by Schaff in his History of the Apostolic Church, on the preparedness of the world at large at just that juncture for the reception of the gospel. It may, however, be questioned whether the apostle had this in his mind in the reference here made to the Divine <span class="accented">prothesmia.</span> So far as appears, his view was fastened upon the history of the development of God's own people, which up to this time had been under the pedagogic custody of the Mosaic Law. Indeed, in just this context he does not even advert, as he may be supposed to have done in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, to the effect produced by the Law in preparing God's own people for the gospel, but speaks only of the negative aspect of the legal economy; that is, of those features of "bondage," "powerlessness," and "poverty" which marked it as a state of oppression and helplessness. The training, probably implied in the reference to its "rudiments," stands back for the present out of view; the only notion which is actually brought prominently forward being the comparatively degraded condition in which the child-proprietor was for that while detained. <span class="cmt_word">God sent forth his Son</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). The terms here used require to be very closely considered: they arc fraught with the very essence of the gospel. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in nine other places of the New Testament, all of them in St. Luke's Gospel and the Acts. In six of these (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-53.htm">Luke 1:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-10.htm">Luke 20:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>) the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> is well represented in our English Bible by "away." In the remaining three (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-12.htm">Acts 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a>) - "(Jacob) sent forth our fathers first;" "They sent forth Barnabas as far as to Antioch;" "God hath sent forth his angel") - the preposition represented by "forth" expresses with more or less distinctness the idea that the person sent belonged intimately to the place or the society of the person who sent him. In no one passage is it without its appreciable value. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, without this second prepositional adjunct of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, is used, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-18.htm">John 17:18</a>, both of the Father sending the Son and of Christ sending his apostles" into the world," but without putting forward this indication of previous intimate connection. So the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is used in like manner of God sending his Son in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, and of the mission of the Holy Spirit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>. It was, no doubt, optional with the writer or speaker whether he would employ a verb denoting this particular shade of meaning present in the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> or not; but we are not, therefore, at liberty to infer that, when he chooses to employ a verb which does denote it, he uses it without a distinct consciousness of its specific force. In the clause before us, therefore, as also in ver. 6, the writer must be assumed to have had in his mind at least the thought of heaven as the sphere of existence from which the Son and the Spirit were sent, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a> above cited, if not of some yet closer association with the Sender. The reference to a previously subsisting intimacy of being between the Sender and the Sent, which we trace here in the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> of the compound verb, is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, where the verb employed is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, indicated in the emphatic reference implied in the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "sending <span class="accented">his</span> own Son." In endeavouring next to determine the import of the expression," his Son," as here introduced, we are met by the surmise that the apostle may have written it <span class="accented">proleptically</span>, or by anticipation; that is, as describing, not what Christ was before he was sent forth, but the glory and acceptableness with the Almighty which marked him as the Messiah after his appearing in the world; for when, for example, in another place the apostle writes," Christ Jesus came into the world to rove sinners," he must be understood as expressing himself <span class="accented">proleptically</span>, designating the person who came into the world by the name and office which he bore as among men, and not as he was before he came. A <span class="accented">proleptic</span> designation is therefore conceivable. But this interpretation of the apostle's meaning is resisted by the tendency of the context in the kindred passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, "God sending his own Son <span class="accented">in the likeness of the flesh of sin</span>;" for those added words betoken very strongly that Christ was viewed by the apostle as having been God's Son before he appeared in the flesh. And such is the impression which a reader not preoccupied with other ideas would naturally receive also here. The conviction that this is what the apostle really intended is corroborated by references which he elsewhere makes to Christ's pro-incarnate existence and work; as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>; the latter of which passages, by describing "the Son of God's love" as "the Firstborn of every creature, because by him all things were created" (see Alford, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' on the passage), betokens that St. Paul regarded him as having been even then the "Son of God;" and this, too, in the sense of derivation from "the substance of the Father, ... begotten" (as the Nicene Creed recites) "of his Father before all worlds." We may, therefore, reason, ably believe that the Apostle Paul, whose views alone are now under consideration, recognized these two senses of the term, namely, the theological and the Christologieal, as inseparably blending into one when thus applied to the Lord Jesus; for we must allow that it appears alien to his manner of sentiment and of representation to suppose that he ever uses it in the purely theological sense only. In the view of the apostle Christ was the "Son of God," not only when appointed to be the Messiah, but also before he was "made to be of a woman." Indeed, it should seem that this conception of his person is just that which forms the basis for the subsequent statement that the object of his coming into the world was to procure the adoption of sons for us. <span class="cmt_word">Made of a woman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">made to be of a woman.</span> This, indeed, was probably the sense intended by King James's translators, when they followed Wicklife and the Geneva Bible in rendering "made of a woman;" whilst Tyndale and Cranmer, followed by the Revisers of 1881, give "born of a woman." Just the same divergency of renderings appears in the same English translations in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, "made of the seed of David (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;</span>)," except that Tyndale has "begotten" instead of "born." The difference in sense is appreciable and important: "made" implies a previous state of existence, which "born" does not. So far as the present writer can find, wherever in the New Testament the Authorized Version has "born," we have in the Greek either <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> never having this sense at all. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), "Being made a curse for us," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), "The Word was made flesh;" so here God's Son is described as "made to be of a woman," the phrase, "of a woman," being nearly identical in import with the word "flesh" in St. John, distinctly implying the fact of the Incarnation. The preposition "of" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) denotes derivation of being, as when it is found after the verb "to be" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>, "He that is of God;" "Ye are not of God," pointing back to the claim which (ver. 41) the Jews had made that they had God for their Father. The construction of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to come to be, with a preposition occurs frequently, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>. There can be no doubt that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> must be taken in the next clause with the same meaning as here. <span class="cmt_word">Made under the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, <span class="accented">made to be under the Law.</span> The "Law" here, as in the clause immediately after "those under the Law," indicates, not Law in general, but that particular law of tutorship and of domination over one as yet in the depressed condition of a minor, which the apostle has just before spoken of; that is, a law of ceremonies and of external cult. The article is wanting in the Greek, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>, etc. We cannot be unconscious of a tone of pathos in the apostle's language, thus declaring that he who had before been no less august a being than God's Son, should in conformity with his Father's will have stooped to derive being "from a woman," as well as to become subject to such a Law of servitude as that of Moses was. In the second chapter of the Philip-plans we have a similar account of the Incarnation, in which, with similar pathos, the apostle remarks that he took upon him the form of a "bond-servant" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), being made to be in the like condition to that of men (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); but in that passage the line of thought does not lead to a definite reference of his being made subject to the ceremonial Law. The apostle probably thinks of Christ as being made subject to the Law by his being circumcised; a child of Israelite parents, so long as he was uncircumcised, was repudiated by the Law as one not in the covenant. With reference to the preceding clause," made of a woman," we are naturally led to inquire why this particular was specified. It does not appear to be essential to his argument, as the next clause certainly is. Probably it was added as marking one of the successive steps down which the Son of God descended to that subjection ("servitude," ver. 3) to the ceremonial Law which the apostle is most particularly concerned with. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2.htm">Philippians 2</a>. he is exhibited, first as emptying himself; next, as taking upon him the form of a bond-servant by being made man; and then at length as brought to "the death of the cross;" so here, more briefly, he appears as "sent forth" from the bosom of the Father; next, as made "the son of a woman;" then as brought under the Law, to the end that (of course by the Crucifixion) he might buy off from under the Law those who were subject thereto. If the apostle intended anything more definite by introducing this first clause, it may have been to glance at that fellowship with the whole human race, with all "born of women" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-11.htm">Matthew 11:11</a>), into which God's own Son came by becoming himself "of a woman" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). To refer to yet another point, we can fearlessly affirm that this sentence of the apostle is perfectly <span class="accented">consistent</span> with the belief in the writer's mind that our Lord was born of a <span class="accented">virgin-mother</span>, for a specified reference to this fact did not lie in his way just at present, and therefore is not to be desiderated. The only point for consideration in this respect is whether the expression employed does at all allude to it. Many have thought that it does. But when we consider that "one born of woman." <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, in Hebrew <span class="accented">yelud isshah</span>, was a set phrase to denote a human creature (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-11.htm">Matthew 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-4.htm">Job 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> [Septuagint]), with no particular reference to the woman except as the medium of our being introduced into the world, it has been with much probability judged by most recent critics that the clause shows no colouring of such allusion. Nevertheless, we distinctly recognize in it the sentiment expressed in the familiar verse of the ancient hymn: "Tu, ad liberandum suscepturus hominem, <span class="accented">non horruisti</span> virginis <span class="accented">uterum</span>;" else, why did not the apostle write <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The apostle deals plainly with those who urged the law of Moses together with the gospel of Christ, and endeavoured to bring believers under its bondage. They could not fully understand the meaning of the law as given by Moses. And as that was a dispensation of darkness, so of bondage; they were tied to many burdensome rites and observances, by which they were taught and kept subject like a child under tutors and governors. We learn the happier state of Christians under the gospel dispensation. From these verses see the wonders of Divine love and mercy; particularly of God the Father, in sending his Son into the world to redeem and save us; of the Son of God, in submitting so low, and suffering so much for us; and of the Holy Spirit, in condescending to dwell in the hearts of believers, for such gracious purposes. Also, the advantages Christians enjoy under the gospel. Although by nature children of wrath and disobedience, they become by grace children of love, and partake of the nature of the children of God; for he will have all his children resemble him. Among men the eldest son is heir; but all God's children shall have the inheritance of eldest sons. May the temper and conduct of sons ever show our adoption; and may the Holy Spirit witness with our spirits that we are children and heirs of God.</body></html>
