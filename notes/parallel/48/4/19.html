It is used to heighten the tenderness of the appeal. The simple form, however, "my children," is found in some of the best MSS., and perhaps should be adopted. St. Paul regards as his spiritual children all who first received the gospel from him.<p><span class= "bld">Of whom I travail in birth again.</span>--The struggle which ends in the definite winning over of his converts to Christ, the Apostle compares to the process of birth by which "a man is born into the world." In the case of the Galatians, after their relapse, this struggle has all to be gone through again.<p><span class= "bld">Until Christ be formed in you.</span>--Just as the formless embryo by degrees takes the shape of man, so the unformed Christian by degrees takes the likeness of Christ. As he grows in grace that likeness becomes more and more defined, till at last the Christian reaches the "stature of the fulness of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>). There is some question as to the punctuation of this verse: whether it should be divided from the last by a full stop, and from the next by a comma, as is usually done; or from the last by a comma, and from the next by a full-stop. It is a nice question of scholarship, in which the weight or preponderance of authority seems, perhaps, rather to incline to the usual view, though some good commentators take the other side. It has been thought best not to alter the punctuation of the English text, though without a clear conviction that it is right.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> [or, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">my little children</span> (or, <span class="accented">my children</span>) <span class="accented">of whom I am again in travail</span>, <span class="accented">until Christ be formed in you.</span> It has been above remarked to be doubtful whether this verse should be conjoined with the preceding verse or with that which follows. The objection to the latter arrangement, presented by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> at the commencement of ver. 20, is thought by many to be obviated by a number of instances which have been alleged in which this conjunction is used with a sentence following a vocative compellation (see Alford, Ellicott). But such cases appear marked by a tone of vivacity and surprise which is not present here. On the other hand, the tone of loving affectionate anxiety breathing in this verse links it more closely with the preceding than with the following one, in which such pathos is no longer discernible, but is replaced by a deliberative attitude of mind. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs as a compellation here only in St. Paul's writings, though repeatedly in St. John's Epistle and once in his Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>), where it appears as used by our Lord in an access of deeply moved affectionate-ness. St. Paul addresses Timothy as "his child" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>, not only as a term of endearment, but as denoting also his having been spiritually begotten by him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). Here the like sense attaches to the word, as is clear from the following clause, "of whom I am again in travail;" but the diminutive form of the noun, agreeing well with the notion of a child at its birth, combines in this case apparently a tender allusion also to the extremely immature character of their Christian discipleship .(compare "babes (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) in Christ," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>) - so immature, in fact, that the apostle is travailing of them afresh, as if not yet born at all. This particular shade of meaning, however, must be sacrificed, if we accept the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "my children," which is highly authenticated. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> cannot be understood as pointing to gestation merely; it can only denote the pangs of parturition. The apostle by this figure describes himself as at this hour in an anguish of desire to bring the souls of his converts both to a complete <span class="accented">state</span> of sonship in Christ Jesus, and to a complete <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of that state - now at length bring them thereto, though that former travail had seemingly been in vain. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a> he refers to himself as a spiritual <span class="accented">father</span> of his converts, and this too with touching pathos. Great is the pathos too of his reference to himself as, in his fostering care of his Thessalonian converts, like a tender "nursing mother cherishing her own children," and also as of a "father" of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7, 11</a>). But neither of those passages equals the present in the expression of intense, even anguished, longing to effect, if only he might be able to effect it, a real transformation in the spiritual character of these Galatian converts. "Until" - I cannot rest till then! - "Christ be formed in you." The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, form, occurs only here in the New Testament in its uncompounded shape. A passage is cited from 'Const. Apost.,' 4:7, in which it occurs in the phrase, "formed man in the womb." In the Septuagint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-22.htm">Exodus 21:22</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the unborn infant. It certainly seems as if the apostle used the word as one belonging to the same region of thought as the <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, but, with the like bold and plastic touch as elsewhere characterizes his use of imagery, refusing to be tied to thorough-going consisteney in its application. Compare for example <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>. When the hour of <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is come, the period of the" formation" of the babe has expired. Further, as showing the freedom of the writer's use of imagery, the easiest way of taking <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is to suppose that "Christ" is here viewed as "<span class="accented">within"</span> them, and not as a likeness to which they are to be conformed: camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>:22, "Christ liveth in me;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, where the "mystery" of the gospel is summed up in the words, "Christ in you the hope of glory." He cannot rest, he means, till the image, thought, of Christ as the Object of their sole and absolute trust, as the complete ground of their acceptance with God and their sonship, shall be perfectly and abidingly formed in their hearts. The hour in which a perfectly formed "Christ," that fair' Divine Child of joy and hope, has come to be there, in their hearts, will be the hour in which the apostle's travailing pangs have issued in their birth. No doubt the apostle is writing to persons baptized into Christ and thus clothed with Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>); persons, in the language of the Church, "born again." But however straitly <span class="accented">we</span> choose to be restrained in the use of such images, solidifying into rigid dogma similitudes used for such passing illustration as the occasion of the moment requires, the sacred writers themselves recognize no such restriction. As Chrysostom observes in his 'Commentary,' the apostle's language in effect is, "Ye need a fresh new-birth, a fresh remoulding (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." Baptized into Christ as those Galatians were, they were, however, in his view no true sons of God, until Christ had been really formed in their hearts. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:19,20 The Galatians were ready to account the apostle their enemy, but he assures them he was their friend; he had the feelings of a parent toward them. He was in doubt as to their state, and was anxious to know the result of their present delusions. Nothing is so sure a proof that a sinner has passed into a state of justification, as Christ being formed in him by the renewal of the Holy Spirit; but this cannot be hoped for, while men depend on the law for acceptance with God.</body></html>
