The Aramaic "Abba" appears in our word "abbot."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And because ye are sons</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>). The apostle is adducing proof that God's people had actually received the adoption of sons; it was because it was so, that God had sent into their hearts the Holy Spirit, imparting that vivid consciousness of sonship which they enjoyed. The fact of the adoption must have been there, to <span class="accented">qualify</span> them to be recipients of this divinely inspired consciousness. The affirmation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>, "The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of God," closely resembles our present passage; but it is not identical. We are not made sons (the apostle intimates) by the Spirit giving us the consciousness of sonship; but, having been previously made sons, the Spirit raises in our spirits sentiments answering to the filial relation already established. The position of the clause introduced by "because" is like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-15.htm">1 Corinthians 12:15, 16</a>. The persons recited by the "ye" are still God's people; not the Galatian believers in particular, except as a portion of the whole Church of God. The apostle puts the thought in this form to bring the truth more strikingly home to their minds. This he does more closely still in the next verse by "thou." But that he has in view God's people as a whole is clear, not only from the whole strain of the context, but also from the phrase, "into our hearts," in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">God</span> <span class="cmt_word">hath sent forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">God sent forth.</span> The tense indicates that the apostle does not refer to a sending forth of God's Spirit to each individual believer, parallel to that "sealing" which believers are stated to be subjects of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>. This historic aorist, as it does in ver. 4, points to one particular emission - that by which the Comforter was sent forth to take up his dwelling in the Church as his temple through all time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of his Son</span>. The Spirit which "anointed" Jesus to be the <span class="accented">Christ</span>; which throughout animated the God-Man Jesus; which prompted him in full filial consciousness, himself in a certain critical hour with loud outcry (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) to call out, "Abba, Father!" The phrase, "his Son," is aetiological; by it the apostle intimates that it was only congruous that the Spirit which had animated the whole life of the incarnate Son should be shed forth upon those who by faith become one with him, and should manifest his presence with them, as well as their union with Christ, by outcome of sentiment similar to that which Christ had expressed. Since the sonship of Christ is here spoken of as if it were not merely antecedent, but also in some way preparatory to the sending forth of the Spirit, it best suits the connection to construe it, not, as in ver. 4, as that belonging to him in his preincarnate state of being, but as that which appertained to him after being "made to be of a woman," and in which his disciples might be considered as standing on a certain footing of parity with him. This harmonizes with the relation which in the Gospels and Acts the sending of the Spirit is represented as holding to his resurrection and ascension. The interpretation above given in one point presupposes the apostle's knowledge of the story of the agony in the garden, when, according to St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>), Jesus himself used the words, "Abba. Father." This presupposition is warranted, not only by the probabilities of the case, but also by what we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a> of the Epistle to the Hebrews, Pauline, certainly, if not actually St. Paul's. We have to add that the Gospels not only make repeated mention of our Lord as addressing the Supreme Being by the compellative of "Father," but also represent him as constantly speaking of God as bearing that relation both to himself and to his disciples. This mode of designating the Almighty was characteristic in the highest degree of Jesus, and up to that time, so far as appears in the Scriptures, unknown. The manner in which the apostle here speaks of the "sending forth" of the Spirit in close proximity to the mention of the "sending forth" of the Son, strongly favours the belief that he regarded the Spirit, as being also a personal agent. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a> we have in the Septuagint "Thou wilt send forth (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) thy Spirit, and they will be created." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a> and Psalm 57:3 God is implored to "send forth [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint] his light and his truth," "his mercy and his truth;" these being poetically personified as angelic messengers. <span class="cmt_word">Into your</span> <span class="cmt_word">hearts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). But this reading of the Textus Receptus <span class="accented">is</span>, by recent editors, replaced by the reading, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">into our hearts</span>, the other reading being regarded as a correction designed to conform this clause with the words, "ye are sons," in the preceding one. In both cases the apostle has in his view the Church of God viewed generally. His putting "our" here instead of "your" was probably an outcome of his feeling of proud gladness in the thought of his own happy experience. A precisely similar change in the pronoun, attributable probably to the same cause, is observable in the remarkably analogous passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, "Ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father." <span class="accented">Crying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">crying out aloud.</span> The word expressing loud utterance betokens in this case undoubting assurance. No faint whisper this of an inner consciousness, shy, reticent, because afraid to assure itself of so. glorious, so blissful a relation; no hesitating half-hope; it is a strong, unwavering conviction, bold, though humbly bold, to thus address the all-holy Supreme himself. The "cry" is here attributed to the Spirit himself; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a> to believers, these being the Spirit's organs of utterance; presently after in the Romans, vers. 26, 27, the Spirit himself is said to "intercede with groanings which cannot be uttered ... . according to the will of God." Analogously, in the Gospels, evil spirits in demoniacs at times are said to "cry out" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-26.htm">Mark 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-26.htm">Mark 9:26</a>), while in other passages the cry is attributed to the possessed person. Abba, Father (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>). In addition to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, just cited, the same remarkable words are found once only besides, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>, as uttered by our Lord in the garden. St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>) gives only "Father" (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>); St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39, 42</a>), "my Father" (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: in ver. 39, however, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is omitted by Tischendorf, though he retains it in ver. 42). St. Matthew, by adding <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> here, which he does not add in Matthew 11:25, 26, seems to indicate that the form of address which our Lord then employed bespoke more than usual of fervency or of intimacy of communion. According to Furst ('Concordance'), "<span class="accented">Abba</span>," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, occurs frequently in the Targums "<span class="accented">sensu</span> proprio et honorifico;" in the Jerusalem Targum taking the form "Ibba," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>. In consequence, we may assume, of the "honorific" complexion of this form of the word, it was in Chaldee the form usually employed in compellation, or for the vocative. The hypothesis that either the Divine Sneaker, or the Evangelist Mark, or the Apostle Paul, added <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> as an explanatory adjunct to the Aramaic "Abba," for the benefit of such as might need the explanation, is resisted <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the threefold recurrence of the conjoined phrases in just the same form; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the absence of any such intimation of a translation as we find given in other passages where an Aramaic word is explained, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38, 41, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36</a>; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the addition of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> being made by St. Paul in the Romans, when writing with a glowing ardour of strong feeling wholly repugnant to the didactic calmness of a translational gloss: he does not pause to add such a gloss to "Maranatha" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>, where it would seem to be much more called for. The apparently nominatival form of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> lends no countenance to this view, as is shown by the comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54, 41</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>: and in the Septuagint, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1, 9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-1.htm">Psalm 7:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Another hypothesis that the twofold compellative was meant to intimate that God was now Father alike to Jewish believers and to Gentile, is wrecked upon its occurrence in St. Mark. The present writer ventures to surmise that the conjoined phrase originated thus: The Lord Jesus, being wont very commonly to substitute for the name "God" the designation of "Father," may be supposed to have used for this designation the word "Abba" as the honorific form of the Chaldaic noun for "father," in much the same way as the Jews regularly substituted the noun <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, an honorific form of <span class="accented">Adonim</span>, "lord," or "master," for the unutterable tetragrammaton, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>. Instead of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, Christ (it may be supposed) customarily employed the word "Abha," as an almost <span class="accented">proper name</span> of the Supreme Being. When our Lord had occasion to apply the word "Father" as a <span class="accented">common noun</span> to God, whether in addressing him or in speaking of him, we may infer firm the Peshito-Syriac Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a> that he added another form of the same original noun "<span class="accented">Abj</span>," or "<span class="accented">Obj</span>," instead of or in addition to "Abba." The <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a> may have been used to represent "<span class="accented">Abba</span>;" St. Matthew's <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to represent "<span class="accented">Abj"</span> or "<span class="accented">Obj."</span> The use of "<span class="accented">Abba</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> by believers, probably quite an exceptional <span class="accented">use</span>, was adopted, both as a conscious reminiscence of Christ's utterance in the garden - they, by conjoining themselves thus with their Lord, pleading, as it were, his Name as their warrant for claiming this filial relation with the Most High - and also as an intensely emphatic description of God's fatherhood, by conjoining together the almost <span class="accented">proper name</span> denoting his general fatherhood by which (supposably) Christ was used to designate God, and the <span class="accented">common noun</span> by which Christ's disciples had by him been taught to address him in prayer, and which embodied their sense of his especial fatherhood to those who serve him. The apostle is not to be understood as intimating that the Holy Spirit does actually produce in every heart in which he dwells the definite consciousness of sonship. It is enough for his purpose that the <span class="accented">nisus</span>, the endeavour and tendency of his spiritual operation, is in all cases in that direction, though through slackness on their own part so many Christians fail of conquering for themselves the full possession of their inheritance. But, however, we need not (he implies)go back to Mosaic ceremonialism to seek <span class="accented">there</span> for our assured sonship. We <span class="accented">have</span> it already here - here, in Christ, and in the indwelling presence of his Spirit. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The apostle deals plainly with those who urged the law of Moses together with the gospel of Christ, and endeavoured to bring believers under its bondage. They could not fully understand the meaning of the law as given by Moses. And as that was a dispensation of darkness, so of bondage; they were tied to many burdensome rites and observances, by which they were taught and kept subject like a child under tutors and governors. We learn the happier state of Christians under the gospel dispensation. From these verses see the wonders of Divine love and mercy; particularly of God the Father, in sending his Son into the world to redeem and save us; of the Son of God, in submitting so low, and suffering so much for us; and of the Holy Spirit, in condescending to dwell in the hearts of believers, for such gracious purposes. Also, the advantages Christians enjoy under the gospel. Although by nature children of wrath and disobedience, they become by grace children of love, and partake of the nature of the children of God; for he will have all his children resemble him. Among men the eldest son is heir; but all God's children shall have the inheritance of eldest sons. May the temper and conduct of sons ever show our adoption; and may the Holy Spirit witness with our spirits that we are children and heirs of God.</body></html>
