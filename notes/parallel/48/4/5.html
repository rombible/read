But why, in order to effect this object, was it prerequisite, as it is here implied that it was, that he should be himself "brought under the Law"? The directions which the Law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a> gave with respect to those "hanged on a tree" were apparently held by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26, 27</a>) to apply also to the case of persons so hanged who were not Israelites. If so, does it not follow (an objector may say) that Jesus, even if not an Israelite under the Law, would, however, by being crucified, have fallen under the curse of the Law, and thereby annihilated the Law for all who by faith should become partakers with him, whether Jews or Gentiles? why, then, should be have been brought under the Law? The objection is met by the consideration that, in order that Christ might abrogate the Law by becoming subject to its curse, it was necessary that he should himself be perfectly acceptable to God, not only as being the eternal "Son of his love," but also in the entire completeness of his life as a man, and, therefore, by perfect obedience to the will of God as declared in the Law, under which it had pleased God to place his people. The Law, whatever the degradation which its ceremonial institute inferred for "the sons of God" subjected to it, was, nevertheless, for the time, God's manifest ordinance, to which all who sought to serve him were bound to submit them&deg; selves. They could not be righteous before him unless they walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-6.htm">Luke 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we might</span> <span class="cmt_word">receive the adoption of sons</span> (<span class="greek_word">i%na th\n</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, that our adoptive sonship might be actually and in full measure made over to us. The" we" recites God's people; the same persons as those indicated by the preceding phrase, "those which were under the Law," which phrase was not meant to define one particular class among God's people, but to describe the condition in which God's people had been placed. Their Father had put them under the Law with the view of their being at his appointed time bought off from the Law and admitted to the full enjoyment of their filial privileges. This purpose of their Father, signified beforehand in the promises to Abraham, explains the article before <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: it was the adoptive sonship which had been guaranteed to them. Hence the use here of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>: for the prepositional prefix of this compound verb has always its force; generally denoting our receiving a thing in some way due to us, answering to its force in the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, repay: sometimes our receiving a thing in full measure (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-41.htm">Luke 23:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-24.htm">Colossians 3:24</a> 2John 8). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-27.htm">Luke 15:27</a> it is receiving <span class="accented">back</span> one lost. The second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is subordinate to the first; the deliverance of God's people from the Law was in order to their introduction into their complete state of sonship. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> does not appear to occur in any Greek writer except St. Paul; though <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, are found in various authors. After the analogy of other compound verbal nouns with a similar termination (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, etc.), it means first the <span class="accented">act</span> of adoption, as, perhaps, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>; and then, quite naturally, the consequent condition of the adopted child, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>; and this seems its more prominent sense here. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a> suggests the surmise that the term had been in use before among Palestinian Jews, with reference to Israel's state under the theocracy, and that St. Paul borrowed it thence with reference to the Christian Church, in which it found a more complete realization. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The apostle deals plainly with those who urged the law of Moses together with the gospel of Christ, and endeavoured to bring believers under its bondage. They could not fully understand the meaning of the law as given by Moses. And as that was a dispensation of darkness, so of bondage; they were tied to many burdensome rites and observances, by which they were taught and kept subject like a child under tutors and governors. We learn the happier state of Christians under the gospel dispensation. From these verses see the wonders of Divine love and mercy; particularly of God the Father, in sending his Son into the world to redeem and save us; of the Son of God, in submitting so low, and suffering so much for us; and of the Holy Spirit, in condescending to dwell in the hearts of believers, for such gracious purposes. Also, the advantages Christians enjoy under the gospel. Although by nature children of wrath and disobedience, they become by grace children of love, and partake of the nature of the children of God; for he will have all his children resemble him. Among men the eldest son is heir; but all God's children shall have the inheritance of eldest sons. May the temper and conduct of sons ever show our adoption; and may the Holy Spirit witness with our spirits that we are children and heirs of God.</body></html>
