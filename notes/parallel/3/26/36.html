This obviates the insertion of the expression "alive," which is not in the original, and is not put in the Authorised Version in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm" title="And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.">Leviticus 26:39</a>, where the same phrase occurs. Where these will remain is explained in the next clause.<p><span class= "bld">I will send a faintness into their hearts.</span>--That is, He will implant in them such timidity and cowardice that they will be frightened at the faintest sound. He will make life a misery to them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/28-65.htm" title="And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:">Deuteronomy 28:65-67</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-39.</span> - The final punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Upon them that are left,</span> that is, the surviving captives and exiles, I will send a faintness into their hearts, - so <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-7.htm">Ezekiel 21:7</a>, "And every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water" -... <span class="cmt_word">and the sound of a shaken</span> (or <span class="accented">driven</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>leaf shall chase them;... and they shall fall,... and ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands.</span> This is the concluding threat. It is conditional in its nature, and the condition having been fulfilled, we may say with reverence that it has been accomplished. Those of the ten tribes who did not find their way to Babylon, and so became absorbed in the body which returned to Jerusalem, have been <span class="accented">eaten up by the land of their enemies</span>, and have <span class="accented">pined away in their enemies' lands.</span> Neither they nor their descendants are to be found in any part of the globe, however much investigation may employ itself in searching for them. They have been absorbed by the populations among which they were scattered. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:14-39 After God has set the blessing before them which would make them a happy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse before them, the evils which would make them miserable, if they were disobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.</body></html>
