And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the asses.">1Samuel 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-20.htm" title="And as for your asses that were lost three days ago, set not your mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you, and on all your father's house?">1Samuel 9:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-6.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm" title="The diseased have you not strengthened, neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which was broken, neither have you brought again that which was driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them.">Ezekiel 34:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-16.htm" title="I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.">Ezekiel 34:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-176.htm" title="I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant; for I do not forget your commandments.">Psalm 119:176</a>, &c.) The context plainly shows that utter destruction is not meant here. The very next verse speaks of a remnant who are to pine away, whilst <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-40.htm" title="If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;">Leviticus 26:40</a> speaks of their confessing their guilt.<p><span class= "bld">The land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span>--That is, they shall be so completely mixed up with the heathen nations amongst whom they are to be dispersed, and so utterly incorporated amongst them, that they will disappear, and have no separate existence. This is the sense of this peculiar phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-32.htm" title="And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eats up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.">Numbers 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-13.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because they say to you, You land devour up men, and have bereaved your nations:">Ezekiel 36:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:14-39 After God has set the blessing before them which would make them a happy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse before them, the evils which would make them miserable, if they were disobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.</body></html>
