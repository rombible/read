And she answered, This woman said to me, Give your son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.">2Kings 6:28-29</a>), and at the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans, which Jeremiah thus bewails, "the hands of pitiful women have sodden their own children, they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-10.htm" title="The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.">Lamentations 4:10</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-9.htm" title="And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and narrow place, with which their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.">Jeremiah 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm" title="Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the middle of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds.">Ezekiel 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-9.htm" title="Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dies, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.">Zechariah 11:9</a>, &c.).

Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.</body></html>
