The famine that is to come upon them is described as making <span class="cmt_word">ten women bake bread in one oven,</span> - whereas in ordinary times one oven was only sufficient for one woman's baking - and <span class="cmt_word">they shall deliver you your bread again by weight;</span> that is, the quantity baked will have to be weighed out in rations, before any one is allowed to take it. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a>; and as illustrative of the last point, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>, "Behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:14-39 After God has set the blessing before them which would make them a happy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse before them, the evils which would make them miserable, if they were disobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.</body></html>
