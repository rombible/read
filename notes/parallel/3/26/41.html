too proud to make an humble confession. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm" title="And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.">Leviticus 19:23</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm" title="Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.">Jeremiah 9:26</a>.) The same metaphor is used by the Apostle: "Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Accept of the punishment of their iniquity.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">accept willingly, </span>that is, they will acknowledge the justice of their punishment, and be in that frame of mind when they will freely own that the punishment is not commensurate with their guilt, and willingly accept the Divine retribution. The exact shade of meaning covered by this phrase in the original cannot adequately be given in a translation, since the verb here translated "accept," or "accept willingly," is the same which is translated "enjoy" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm" title="Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.">Leviticus 26:34</a>. The whole phrase denotes literally, <span class= "ital">they shall rejoice in their iniquity, </span>or <span class= "ital">in the punishment of their iniquity; </span>they will take it joyfully, as the best and most appropriate means to bring them to repentance. The nearest approach to it is the passage, "I will bear the indignation of the Lord, for I have sinned against him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-9.htm" title="I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.">Micah 7:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:40-46 Among the Israelites, persons were not always prosperous or afflicted according to their obedience or disobedience. But national prosperity was the effect of national obedience, and national judgments were brought on by national wickedness. Israel was under a peculiar covenant. National wickedness will end in the ruin of any people, especially where the word of God and the light of the gospel are enjoyed. Sooner or later, sin will be the ruin, as well as the reproach, of every people. Oh that, being humbled for our sins, we might avert the rising storm before it bursts upon us! God grant that we may, in this our day, consider the things which belong to our eternal peace.</body></html>
