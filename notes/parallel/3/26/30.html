For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.">Judges 13:16-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm" title="And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.">1Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm" title="Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.">1Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-3.htm" title="But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.">2Kings 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm" title="And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering.">1Chronicles 21:26</a>, &c.), the context shows that the high places here are such as were dedicated to idolatrous worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.">Numbers 22:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-52.htm" title="Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm" title="You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm" title="Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,">Joshua 13:17</a>, &c.). By the destruction of these places of idolatrous worship, the Israelites would see how utterly worthless those deities were whom they preferred to the God who had wrought such signal redemption for them.<p><span class= "bld">And cut down your images.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and cut down your sun-images, </span>or <span class= "ital">solar-statues, </span>that is, idolatrous pillars of the sun-god (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-8.htm" title="And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.">Isaiah 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm" title="Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.">2Chronicles 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-7.htm" title="And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 34:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols.</span>--Nothing could show a greater contempt both for the idol-worshippers and the idols than the picture here given. When the apostate Israelites have succumbed to the sword, famine, and pestilence, they will not even have a seemly burial, but their carcases will be mixed up with the shattered remains of their gods, and thus form one dunghill. Similar is the picture given by Ezekiel, "Your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain men before your idols, and I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/6-4.htm" title="And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.">Ezekiel 6:4-5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:14-39 After God has set the blessing before them which would make them a happy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse before them, the evils which would make them miserable, if they were disobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.</body></html>
