In Palestine the proper season for the early rain is from about the middle of October until December, thus preparing the ground for receiving the seed, whilst that of the latter or vernal rain is in the months of March and April, just before the harvest. Thus, also, in the covenant which God is to make with His people, a similar promise is made, "I will cause the showers to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-26.htm" title="And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.">Ezekiel 34:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - These verses appear to have been in the mind, not of Joel only, as already pointed out, but of Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-20.htm">Ezekiel 34:20-31</a>). In Leviticus we find, <span class="cmt_word">Then I will give you rain in due season;</span> in Ezekiel, "And I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing." In Leviticus, <span class="cmt_word">And the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit;</span> in Ezekiel, "And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth her increase." In Leviticus<span class="cmt_word">, Ye shall dwell in your land safely;</span> in Ezekiel, "They shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods." In Leviticus, <span class="cmt_word">And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land;</span> in Ezekiel, "And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land.... And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid." The promise, <span class="cmt_word">Your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time,</span> is similar to that in the prophet Amos, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-13 This chapter contains a general enforcement of all the laws given by Moses; by promises of reward in case of obedience, on the one hand; and threatenings of punishment for disobedience, on the other. While Israel maintained a national regard to God's worship, sabbaths, and sanctuary, and did not turn aside to idolatry, the Lord engaged to continue to them temporal mercies and religious advantages. These great and precious promises, though they relate chiefly to the life which now is, were typical of the spiritual blessings made sure by the covenant of grace to all believers, through Christ. 1. Plenty and abundance of the fruits of the earth. Every good and perfect gift must be expected from above, from the Father of lights. 2. Peace under the Divine protection. Those dwell in safety, that dwell in God. 3. Victory and success in their wars. It is all one with the Lord to save by many or by few. 4. The increase of their people. The gospel church shall be fruitful. 5. The favour of God, which is the fountain of all Good. 6. Tokens of his presence in and by his ordinances. The way to have God's ordinances fixed among us, is to cleave closely to them. 7. The grace of the covenant. All covenant blessings are summed up in the covenant relation, I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and they are all grounded upon their redemption. Having purchased them, God would own them, and never cast them off till they cast him off.</body></html>
