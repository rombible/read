These two diseases also occur together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-22.htm" title="The LORD shall smite you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.">Deuteronomy 28:22</a>, the only passage in the Bible where they occur again. The second of the two, however, which is here translated "burning ague" in the Authorised Version, is, in the Deuteronomy passage, rendered simply by "fever." The two passages ought to be uniformly rendered.<p><span class= "bld">That shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that shall extinguish the eyes, and cause life to waste away. </span>The rendering of the Authorised Version, "consume the eyes," though giving the sense, is misleading, inasmuch as it suggests that the verb "consume" is the same as the disease, "consumption" mentioned in the preceding clause. For the phrase "extinguish the eye"--the eye failing--see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-20.htm" title="But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.">Job 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm" title="He that speaks flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.">Job 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-16.htm" title="If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;">Job 31:16</a>, &c, and for the whole phrase, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-65.htm" title="And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-23.htm" title="And he said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.">1Samuel 2:23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span>--Besides these terrible diseases, the production of the soil, which is necessary for the sustenance of life, and which is to be so abundant and secure against enemies when the Israelites obey the Divine commandments (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/26-4.htm" title="Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.">Leviticus 26:4-6</a>), will be carried off by strangers. Similar threatenings in case of disobedience are to be found both in the Pentateuch (Deut. xxviii, 33, 51) and in the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-17.htm" title="And they shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat: they shall eat up your flocks and your herds: they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees: they shall impoverish your fenced cities, wherein you trusted, with the sword.">Jeremiah 5:17</a>). The most striking parallel is the one in Micah, "Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-15.htm" title="You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but you shall not anoint you with oil; and sweet wine, but shall not drink wine.">Micah 6:15</a>). For the reverse state of things, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-8.htm" title="The LORD has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give your corn to be meat for your enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink your wine, for the which you have labored:">Isaiah 62:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/65-22.htm" title="They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.">Isaiah 65:22-23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:14-39 After God has set the blessing before them which would make them a happy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse before them, the evils which would make them miserable, if they were disobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.</body></html>
