The high places intended here are the spots where the "sun-images" were erected (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm">2 Chronicles 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-8.htm">Isaiah 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols</span> - that is, they should roll in the dust together. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make your cities waste</span> - as Samaria and Jerusalem - <span class="cmt_word">and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation,</span> - by the <span class="accented">sanctuaries</span>, which are to be desolated, is meant all the consecrated things: the holy of holies, the holy place, the court, the ark, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt sacrifice - <span class="cmt_word">and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours</span> - so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>, "To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I will bring the land into desolation</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>): and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-15.htm">Ezekiel 5:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-16.htm">Jeremiah 9:16</a>, "I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:14-39 After God has set the blessing before them which would make them a happy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse before them, the evils which would make them miserable, if they were disobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.</body></html>
