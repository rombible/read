Hitherto the law mainly discussed the blood of sacrificial animals, or those quadrupeds which were slaughtered at home. In this and the following verses the statute is extended to all other creatures which, though wild, are legally clean and used as food.<p><span class= "bld">Which hunteth and catcheth.</span>--Hunting, which was an amusement with other nations of antiquity, was with the serious Hebrew a matter of necessity. It was resorted to as a matter of necessity to exterminate dangerous beasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-29.htm" title="I will not drive them out from before you in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against you.">Exodus 23:29</a>), but more especially to procure food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-27.htm" title="And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.">Genesis 25:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm" title="The slothful man roasts not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.">Proverbs 12:27</a>). Besides the numerous pitfalls, snares, traps, &c, which are so frequently mentioned in the Bible, the Hebrews also employed arms in catching game (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-3.htm" title="Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;">Genesis 27:3</a>). When wounded, or when the game had to be killed to facilitate its being carried home, the hunters were liable to become careless about the blood, as is evident from the practice which obtained among some of the ancients. Thus we are told that the Zabians, when they slew a beast, put the blood into a vessel or into a hole which they dug in the ground, and then sat round and feasted on it. It is to prevent such outrages on the sacred blood, which the hunters were especially liable to commit when hungry, that the law is here enacted. An instance of the hungry army flying upon the spoil, killing the cattle in the field, and eating the flesh with the blood, is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/14-32.htm" title="And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.">1Samuel 14:32-34</a>. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-25.htm" title="Why say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall you possess the land?">Ezekiel 33:25</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Any beast or fowl that may be eaten.</span>--That is, those wild beasts or fowl which, according to the dietary law, were usually eaten. During the second Temple this was interpreted strictly to apply to the clean wild beasts, but not to those not permitted to be eaten.<p><span class= "bld">He shall even pour out the blood.</span>--The earth, from which all animals came forth at their creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.">Genesis 1:24</a>), is to receive back again the principle of their life. They proceeded from the womb of the earth, and their life-blood is to return to it. With such scrupulous care was this law observed during the second Temple, that the following Benediction was ordered to be recited when the blood was covered up: "Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hath sanctified us by His precepts, and hath commanded us to cover up the blood."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - Negatively, it has been ordered that blood shall not be eaten; positively, that it is to be offered to God. But there may be cases where the latter command cannot be caused out, as when animals are killed in hunting. On such occasions the man who kills the animal, whether he be an Israelite or a sojourner, is to <span class="cmt_word">pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust,</span> regarding it as a sacred thing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:10-16 Here is a confirmation of the law against eating blood. They must eat no blood. But this law was ceremonial, and is now no longer in force; the coming of the substance does away the shadow. The blood of beasts is no longer the ransom, but Christ's blood only; therefore there is not now the reason for abstaining there then was. The blood is now allowed for the nourishment of our bodies; it is no longer appointed to make an atonement for the soul. Now the blood of Christ makes atonement really and effectually; to that, therefore, we must have regard, and not consider it as a common thing, or treat it with indifference.</body></html>
