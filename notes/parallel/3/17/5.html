</span>that is, which they have heretofore been in the habit of offering in the open fields to heathen deities, and which, in future, they might be inclined to do again. The phrase "open field "denotes the space outside the encampment, in contradistinction to the enclosed place where the Israelites sojourned. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-7.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle on him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.">Leviticus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-53.htm" title="But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.">Leviticus 14:53</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">Even that they may bring them . . . unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and bring them . </span>. . <span class= "ital">to the entrance of the tent of meeting.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices.</span> This passage tells us the purpose of the previous command: it is to prevent sacrifices being sacrificed (the word is twice used in the original) <span class="cmt_word">in the open field,</span> or anywhere else than in the court of the tabernacle. It follows that the command refers to sacrifice, not to mere slaughtering. Clark, taking the opposite view of the command, is obliged to change the translation, <span class="accented">sacrifices which they offer in the open field</span>, into "beasts for slaughter which they now slaughter in the open field" ('Speaker's Commentary'); but he has no authority for doing so. <span class="accented">Zabach</span> means always, in the Pentateuch, to slay in sacrifice. These field sacrifices, when offered to the Lord in the proper place and with the proper ceremonies, would become peace offerings unto the Lord. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 All the cattle killed by the Israelites, while in the wilderness, were to be presented before the door of the tabernacle, and the flesh to be returned to the offerer, to be eaten as a peace-offering, according to the law. When they entered Canaan, this only continued in respect of sacrifices. The spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer, are not confined to any one place. We have now no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift; nor does the gospel unity rest only in one place, but in one heart, and the unity of the Spirit. Christ is our Altar, and the true Tabernacle; in him God dwells among men. It is in him that our sacrifices are acceptable to God, and in him only. To set up other mediators, or other altars, or other expiatory sacrifices, is, in effect, to set up other gods. And though God will graciously accept our family offerings, we must not therefore neglect attending at the tabernacle.</body></html>
