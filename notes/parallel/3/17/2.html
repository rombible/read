Hitherto the Divine communications were made to (1) Moses alone, without his being ordered to speak to any one else (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 5:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-12.htm" title="And the fire on the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order on it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.">Leviticus 6:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 8:1</a>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 14:1</a>); (2) to Moses, with the command to speak to Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;">Leviticus 16:1</a>); (3) to Moses, with the command to speak to Aaron and his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-17.htm" title="It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it to them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.">Leviticus 6:17</a>); (4) to Moses, with a command to speak to the children of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-1.htm" title="And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,">Leviticus 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-28.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 7:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 12:1</a>); (5) to Moses and Aaron conjointly, without being ordered to speak to the children of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-33.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 14:33</a>); (6) to Moses and Aaron conjointly, who <span class= "bld">are </span>ordered to speak to the children of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,">Leviticus 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 15:1</a>); and (7) Aaron alone is addressed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-8.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 10:8</a>). In the chapter before us, however, the communication is made to Moses alone, and he is commanded not only to impart its contents to Aaron and his sons--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the priesthood--but "unto all the children of Israel," or their representatives, at the same time. The pontiff and the priests are thus put on a level with the ordinary Israelite or the laity, as far as this regulation is concerned. There are only two other occasions on which this phrase is used again, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-24.htm" title="And Moses told it to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.">Leviticus 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-18.htm" title="Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whatever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt offering;">Leviticus 22:18</a>.<p><span class= "bld">This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded.</span>--To emphasize the importance of the following law Moses is ordered by God to use this additional formula; whilst in other instances where it is used, when important statutes are enacted, Moses uses it of his own accord. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-16.htm" title="This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take you every man for them which are in his tents.">Exodus 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-4.htm" title="And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,">Exodus 35:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-5.htm" title="And Moses said to the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.">Leviticus 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-6.htm" title="And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that you should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear to you.">Leviticus 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-2.htm" title="If a man vow a vow to the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.">Numbers 30:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-6.htm" title="This is the thing which the LORD does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.">Numbers 36:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 All the cattle killed by the Israelites, while in the wilderness, were to be presented before the door of the tabernacle, and the flesh to be returned to the offerer, to be eaten as a peace-offering, according to the law. When they entered Canaan, this only continued in respect of sacrifices. The spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer, are not confined to any one place. We have now no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift; nor does the gospel unity rest only in one place, but in one heart, and the unity of the Spirit. Christ is our Altar, and the true Tabernacle; in him God dwells among men. It is in him that our sacrifices are acceptable to God, and in him only. To set up other mediators, or other altars, or other expiatory sacrifices, is, in effect, to set up other gods. And though God will graciously accept our family offerings, we must not therefore neglect attending at the tabernacle.</body></html>
