(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-17.htm" title="It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that you eat neither fat nor blood.">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-26.htm" title="Moreover you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.">Leviticus 7:26-27</a>.) Owing to its great importance, however, the law is enacted here <span class= "ital">separately, </span>where it naturally follows the order that the blood of all animals sacrificed in the sanctuary is to be offered to the Lord upon the altar. According to the canons which obtained during the second Temple, the blood of clean fishes, of locusts, and of permissible creeping things is exempted.<p><span class= "bld">I will even set my face against that soul.</span>--That is, make him feel my anger. Though this phrase only occurs twice more in this book, and only once in connection with legal enactments (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-3.htm" title="And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.">Leviticus 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-6.htm" title="And the soul that turns after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-17.htm" title="And I will set my face against you, and you shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.">Leviticus 26:17</a>), yet from its usages in other passages it is clear that the expression "face" denotes anger, which shows itself in the countenance. Thus the phrase, which is translated in the Authorised Version, "I will appease him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-20.htm" title="And Leah said, God has endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.">Genesis 30:20</a>), is in the original, "I will appease his face," where it manifestly stands for <span class= "ital">anger. </span>Hence <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm" title="The anger of the LORD has divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.">Lamentations 4:16</a>, which is in the original, "the face of the Lord hath divided them," is properly rendered in the Authorised Version in the text by "the anger of the Lord." (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-12.htm" title="For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.">1Peter 3:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - The appointment made just above, that the blood of all animals slain in sacrifice should be offered to the Lord on his altar in the court of the tabernacle, leads naturally to a reiteration of the prohibition of the eating of blood, and a statement of the reason of that prohibition. "But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat," was given as a command to Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). It has already been repeated twice in the Book of Leviticus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26</a>), and it is still again found in chapter Leviticus 19:26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>. The present is the <span class="accented">locus classicus</span> which explains the earnestness with which the rule is enforced. It begins with an extension of the obligation from the Israelites to the sojourners among them, and with a solemn declaration that, in case of transgression, God will take into his own bands the punishment of the offenders; not only is he to be cut off or excommunicated by political or ecclesiastical authority, but God himself will <span class="cmt_word">set his face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people,</span> by death, or such means as he chooses to adopt. Then follows the reason for the prohibition. <span class="cmt_word">For the life of the flesh is in the blood.</span> The blood may not be eaten because it is the vehicle of life, literally, <span class="accented">the soul of the flesh</span>, that is, it is the seat of the animal life of the body. "It is the fountain of life," says Harvey; "the first to live, the last to die, and the primary seat of the animal soul; it lives and is nourished of itself, and by no other part of the human body." In consequence of possessing this character, it is to be reserved, <span class="cmt_word">to make an atonement for your souls upon the altar;</span> for thus only blood became qualified for the purpose of atonement. The clause, <span class="cmt_word">for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul,</span> should be translated, <span class="accented">for the blood maketh atonement by means of the soul, i.e.</span>, by means of the life which it contains. It is because the blood is the vehicle of the animal's life, and represents that life, that it serves to cover, or make atonement for, the soul of the offerer of the sacrifice, who presents it instead of his own life. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:10-16 Here is a confirmation of the law against eating blood. They must eat no blood. But this law was ceremonial, and is now no longer in force; the coming of the substance does away the shadow. The blood of beasts is no longer the ransom, but Christ's blood only; therefore there is not now the reason for abstaining there then was. The blood is now allowed for the nourishment of our bodies; it is no longer appointed to make an atonement for the soul. Now the blood of Christ makes atonement really and effectually; to that, therefore, we must have regard, and not consider it as a common thing, or treat it with indifference.</body></html>
