By translating it differently in the first clause, the Authorised Version has unnecessarily increased the difficulty of the verse. This clause assigns the reason why blood must not be eaten. It is the principle of vitality, it constitutes the soul of animal life. Hence blood and life are used interchangeably in the Scriptures. Thus, when the Psalmist exclaims, "what profit is there in my blood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm" title="What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise you? shall it declare your truth?">Psalm 30:9</a>), he uses it for <span class= "ital">life.</span><p><span class= "bld">I have given it to you upon the altar.</span>--For the sake of emphasis, the words in the original denoting "upon the altar" are placed first in the Hebrew, and the Authorised Version follows this order. It is however better to translate this clause, <span class= "ital">For I have ordained it upon the altar to make atonement for your souls. </span>Because it is the principle of life, therefore God has ordained it to be offered upon the altar as an expiation for the offerer's life.<p><span class= "bld">For it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for it is the blood that maketh atonement by means of the soul. </span>As the blood of the victim is identical with its life, and represents the soul of the animal, hence God has appointed it as a substitute for the sinner's life. Thus the life of the sacrifice atones for the life of the offerer. Hence the remark of the Apostle, "without shedding of blood there is no remission" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:10-16 Here is a confirmation of the law against eating blood. They must eat no blood. But this law was ceremonial, and is now no longer in force; the coming of the substance does away the shadow. The blood of beasts is no longer the ransom, but Christ's blood only; therefore there is not now the reason for abstaining there then was. The blood is now allowed for the nourishment of our bodies; it is no longer appointed to make an atonement for the soul. Now the blood of Christ makes atonement really and effectually; to that, therefore, we must have regard, and not consider it as a common thing, or treat it with indifference.</body></html>
