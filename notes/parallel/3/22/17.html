The clause following the mention of castration - neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land - literally translated, <span class="accented">neither shall ye make in your land</span>, probably forbids castration altogether, not merely the offering of castrated animals in sacrifice. The expression, Ye shall offer at your own will, should be understood, as before, for <span class="accented">your acceptance</span> (see note on Leviticus 2:1). Only one exception is made as to blemished offerings: an animal <span class="cmt_word">that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts</span> may be offered for <span class="cmt_word">a freewill offering</span>, but not <span class="cmt_word">for a vow</span> (for the distinction of these offerings, see note on chapter Leviticus 2:1). These rules as to unblemished victims are to apply to the offerings of strangers as well as of Israelites. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-33 Laws concerning the priests and sacrifices. - In this chapter we have divers laws concerning the priests and sacrifices, all for preserving the honour of the sanctuary. Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.</body></html>
