This blemish also disqualified the priest for the service at the altar (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-18.htm" title="For whatever man he be that has a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that has a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,">Leviticus 21:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Or broken.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">broken-limbed </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-9.htm" title="For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challenges to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double to his neighbor.">Exodus 22:9</a>), extending to the head, ribs, &c.<p><span class= "bld">Or maimed.</span>--This was regarded in the time of the second Temple to describe a blemish in the eyebrow. Hence the Chaldee version translates it "one whose eye-brows are fallen off." It would thus correspond to the defect which unfitted the priest for ministering at the altar.<p><span class= "bld">Or having a wen.</span>--According to the Jewish canonists this denotes a disease of the eyes. Hence the Chaldee version translates it "one whose eyes are smitten with a mixture of white and black," thus corresponding to the blemish which unfits the priest mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-19.htm" title="Or a man that is broken footed, or broken handed,">Leviticus 21:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Or scurvy or scabbed.</span>--These are exactly the same two defects specified with regard to the priests (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-20.htm" title="Or hunch back, or a dwarf, or that has a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or has his stones broken;">Leviticus 21:20</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall not offer these unto the Lord.</span>--Though he must not offer animals with such blemishes, and though the man who vowed them for the sanctuary was beaten with stripes, yet the animals thus sanctified were no more his, he had to redeem them according to valuation, and with the money purchase another oblation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-33 Laws concerning the priests and sacrifices. - In this chapter we have divers laws concerning the priests and sacrifices, all for preserving the honour of the sanctuary. Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.</body></html>
