Of the white garments he possessed two sets, one of Egyptian linen, and the other of Indian and less costly linen. The community allowed the high priest thirty minae to purchase these garments, and he could add as much as he liked from his own money if he wished them to be more costly, provided the material was linen made of six double twisted threads and of flax. It was the more costly vestments of Egyptian linen which the high priest wore on this occasion. The latter he put on in the after part of the day when he entered the Holy of Holies to bring out the censer. These garments were the same as those of the ordinary priests, except the turban, which was a little taller.<p><span class= "bld">And he shall wash.</span>--He had to bathe his body every time when he changed his vestments.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - His special garments for the occasion are <span class="cmt_word">the holy linen coat</span>,... <span class="cmt_word">the linen breeches</span>,... <span class="cmt_word">a linen girdle</span>,... <span class="cmt_word">and the linen mitre.</span> In the original the definite article is not expressed. The reading should therefore be, <span class="accented">He shall put on a holy linen coat, and he shall have linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with a linen mitre shall be attired.</span> The clothing was white from head to foot, differing therein from the dress of the ordinary priest, inasmuch as the sash or girdle of the latter was of variegated materials, and differing also in the shape of the mitre. The white clothing was not intended to symbolize humility and penitence, as some have thought, for white is not the colour in which penitents are naturally dressed. Rather it was symbolical of the purity and holiness which the ceremonies of the day symbolically affected, and which was specially needed to be exhibited in the person of the high priest. In the visions of Ezekiel and Daniel, the angel of God is clothed in <span class="accented">linen</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2, 3, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6, 7</a>). And the colour of the angelic raiment is described in the Gospels as <span class="accented">white:</span> "his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>); "they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>); "two men stood by them in shining garments" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>); she "seeth two angels in white sitting" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>). So, too, the wife of the Lamb, in the Book of the Revelation, has it "granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7, 8</a>). The white linen dress of the high priest, therefore (which must have given the appearance of the English surplice tied in at the waist), was intended to symbolize the purity and brightness which forms the characteristic of angels and saints, and, above all, of the King of saints. "The white material of the dress which Aaron wore when performing the highest act of expiation under the Old Testament was a symbolical shadowing forth of the holiness and glory of the one perfect Mediator between God and man, who, being the radiation of the glory of God and the image of his nature, effected by himself the perfect cleansing away of our sin, and who, as the true High Priest, being holy, innocent, unspotted, and separate from sinners, entered once by his own blood into the holy place not made with hands, namely, into heaven itself, to appear before the face of God for us and obtain everlasting redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12, 24</a>)" (Keil). The symbolism of the <span class="accented">holy garments</span> as indicating holiness and purity, is strengthened by the command that Aaron is to <span class="cmt_word">wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.</span> The high priest's acts on this day, so far as they are recounted in this chapter, were the following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He bathed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He dressed himself in his white holy garments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> He offered or presented at the door of the tabernacle a bullock for a sin offering for himself and his house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> He presented at the same place two goats for a sin offering for the congregation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> He cast lots on the two goats, one of which was to be sacrificed, the other to he let go into the wilderness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> He sacrificed the bullock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> He passed from the court through the holy place into the holy of holies with a censer and incense, and filled the space beyond the vail with a cloud of smoke from the incense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> He returned to the court, and, taking some of the blood of the bullock, passed again within the vail, and there sprinkled the blood once on the front of the mercy-seat and seven times before it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">9.</span> He came out again into the court, and killed the goat on which the lot for sacrifice had fallen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">10.</span> For the third time he entered the holy of holies, and went through the same process with the goat's blood as with the bullock's blood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">11.</span> He purified the other part of the tabernacle, as he had purified the holy of holies, by sprinkling with the atoning blood, as before, and placing some of it on the horns of the altar of incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">12.</span> He returned to the court, and placed the blood of the bullock and goat upon the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice, and sprinkled it seven times. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">13.</span> He offered to God the remaining goat, laying his hands upon it, confessing and laying the sins of the people upon its head. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">14.</span> He consigned the goat to a man, whose business it was to conduct it to the border of the wilderness, and there release it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">15.</span> He bathed and changed his linen vestments for his commonly worn high priest's dress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">16.</span> He sacrificed, one after the other, the two rams as burnt offerings for himself and for the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">17.</span> He burnt the fat of the sin offerings upon the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">18.</span> He took measures that the remainder of the sin offerings should be burnt without the camp. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7-11</a>, twelve sacrifices are commanded to be offered by the high priest on this day, namely, the morning and evening sacrifice; a burnt offering for the people, consisting of one young bullock, one ram (as already stated), and seven lambs; and cue goat for a sin offering; so that in all there were fifteen sacrifices offered, besides the meat and drink offerings. The punctiliousness of the Jews in later times was not content that the ceremonies should begin on the day itself. Preparations commenced a full week previously. On the third day of the seventh month, the high priest moved from his house in the city into the temple, and he was twice sprinkled with the ashes of the red heifer, by way of precaution against defilement. He spent the week in practicing and rehearsing, under the eye of some of the elders of the Sanhedrim, the various acts that he would have to perform on the great day, and on the night immediately preceding it he was not allowed to sleep. In case of his sudden death or disqualification, a substitute was appointed to fulfill his function. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Without entering into particulars of the sacrifices on the great day of atonement, we may notice that it was to be a statute for ever, till that dispensation be at an end. As long as we are continually sinning, we continually need the atonement. The law of afflicting our souls for sin, is a statue which will continue in force till we arrive where all tears, even those of repentance, will be wiped from our eyes. The apostle observes it as a proof that the sacrifices could not take away sin, and cleanse the conscience from it, that in them there was a remembrance made of sin every year, upon the day of atonement, Heb 10:1,3. The repeating the sacrifices, showed there was in them but a feeble effort toward making atonement; this could be done only by offering up the body of Christ once for all; and that sacrifice needed not to be repeated.</body></html>
