This is expressed by the fuller form, "to afflict the soul with fasting." in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm" title="But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.">Psalm 35:13</a>, where the Authorised Version inconsistently translates it, "humbled my soul." This is the only public fast ordained in the Mosaic Law; and the authorities during the second Temple defined more minutely in what this fasting consists. According to the canon law it consists not only in abstaining from eating and drinking, but from washing, anointing, wearing of shoes or sandals, and the marriage-bed, as they were the outward signs of joy. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm" title="Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where you go.">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>.) If any one presumptuously ate as much as a date with a kernel, or drank as much as fills one cheek, he violated the Law, and incurred the penalty of excision. If he did it unintentionally he had to bring a sin offering. The fast lasted from evening to evening, and is rigorously kept by Jews to this day. Exception was and still is made in the case of pregnant women, invalids, and children. This is the fast which the Apostle refers to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>. The marginal note on this passage, viz., "the fast was on the tenth day of the seventh month" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm" title="Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-29.htm" title="For whatever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.">Leviticus 23:29</a>), is not to be found in the first edition of the Authorised Version. It was introduced by Bishop Lloyd in the Bible published in London, 1701, fol., who took it from the Geneva Version (Geneva, 1560), and it was adopted in the Oxford 4to edition, 1703. When Christ admonishes his followers, "When thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm" title="But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;">Matthew 6:17</a>), He refers to the canonical law about fasting here given.<p><span class= "bld">And do no work at all.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">ye shall do no manner of work, </span>as the same phrase is rendered in the Authorised Version in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-31.htm" title="You shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:31</a>. It is to be regretted that this legal phrase, which occurs five times in the Pentateuch, four of which are to be found in this very book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm" title="And this shall be a statute for ever to you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojournes among you:">Leviticus 16:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm" title="Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; you shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-28.htm" title="And you shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.">Leviticus 23:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-31.htm" title="You shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm" title="And you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and you shall afflict your souls: you shall not do any work therein:">Numbers 29:7</a>), should have been translated differently in the Authorised Version. This variation is all the more glaring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm" title="And you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and you shall afflict your souls: you shall not do any work therein:">Numbers 29:7</a>, which is the parallel passage to this. The day was to be a rest from all manual and other secular work exactly as on the Sabbath, with this exception, that whilst work on the Sabbath was punished with stoning, labour on the Day of Atonement was punished with excision.<p><span class= "bld">A stranger that sojourneth among you.</span>--That is, one of non-Jewish descent who had renounced idolatry, and-voluntarily joined the Jewish community. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-19.htm" title="Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.">Exodus 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm" title="But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:">Exodus 20:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-31.</span> - The ceremonies of the Day of Atonement are not appointed for once only, but they are to be of annual observance. This <span class="cmt_word">shall be a statute for ever unto you</span>, as long as the nation should exist, that <span class="cmt_word">in the seventh month, on the tenth</span> day <span class="cmt_word">of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all.</span> The seventh is the sacred month, in which the first, the tenth, the fifteenth, and following days are appointed as holy seasons. The Day of Atonement is the single fast of the Jewish Church occurring once a year only. On it all the members of that Church were to <span class="accented">afflict their souls</span>, on pain of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-29.htm">Leviticus 23:29</a>). The fast began on the evening of the ninth day, and ended on the evening of the tenth, when it was succeeded by general feasting. During the whole of the twenty-four hours <span class="accented">no work at all</span> was to be done. In this respect the Day of Atonement was put on a level with the sabbath, whereas on the annual festivals only "servile work" was forbidden (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-7.htm">Leviticus 23:7, 21, 25, 35</a>). On this day, therefore, as on the weekly sabbath, it was not permitted to collect manna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-26.htm">Exodus 16:26</a>), or to plough or reap (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-21.htm">Exodus 34:21</a>), or to light a fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-3.htm">Exodus 35:3</a>), or to gather wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-36</a>), or to carry corn or fruit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>), or to sell food or other goods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-16.htm">Nehemiah 13:16</a>), or to bear burdens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-22.htm">Jeremiah 17:22, 23</a>), or to set out grain for sale (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>). And these regulations applied to <span class="cmt_word">strangers that sojourned among them</span> as well as to themselves. It was <span class="cmt_word">a sabbath of rest</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">sabbath of sabbatism.</span> The purpose of the abstinence from food and labour was to bring the soul of each individual into harmony with the solemn rites of purification publicly performed not by themselves, but by the high priest. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:15-34 Here are typified the two great gospel privileges, of the remission of sin, and access to God, both of which we owe to our Lord Jesus. See the expiation of guilt. Christ is both the Maker and the Matter of the atonement; for he is the Priest, the High Priest, that makes reconciliation for the sins of the people. And as Christ is the High Priest, so he is the Sacrifice with which atonement is made; for he is all in all in our reconciliation to God. Thus he was figured by the two goats. The slain goat was a type of Christ dying for our sins; the scape-goat a type of Christ rising again for our justification. The atonement is said to be completed by putting the sins of Israel upon the head of the goat, which was sent away into a wilderness, a land not inhabited; and the sending away of the goat represented the free and full remission of their sins. He shall bear upon him all their iniquities. Thus Christ, the Lamb of God, takes away the sin of the world, by taking it upon himself, Joh 1:29. The entrance into heaven, which Christ made for us, was typified by the high priest's entrance into the most holy place. See Heb 9:7. The high priest was to come out again; but our Lord Jesus ever lives, making intercession, and always appears in the presence of God for us. Here are typified the two great gospel duties of faith and repentance. By faith we put our hands upon the head of the offering; relying on Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, pleading his satisfaction, as that which alone is able to atone for our sins, and procure us a pardon. By repentance we afflict our souls; not only fasting for a time from the delights of the body, but inwardly sorrowing for sin, and living a life of self-denial, assuring ourselves, that if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. By the atonement we obtain rest for our souls, and all the glorious liberties of the children of God. Sinner, get the blood of Christ effectually applied to thy soul, or else thou canst never look God in the face with any comfort or acceptance. Take this blood of Christ, apply it by faith, and see how it atones with God.</body></html>
