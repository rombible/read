On the one was engraved the words "For Jehovah," and on the other "For Azazel," the expression in the original, which is translated <span class= "ital">scapegoat </span>in the Authorised Version. The high priest, after shaking the chest, put both his hands into the urn and simultaneously took out the two tablets, one in each hand. Hereupon he put the tablet which he had in his right hand upon the goat that was standing on his right side, whilst the tablet in his left hand he put on the goat on his left side. If the tablet with the in scription "For Jehovah was in his right hand the chief priest who stood at the right of the pontiff exclaimed "Hold up thy right hand on high!" and if it happened to be in the left hand, the chief of the principal household, who stood on his left, called out to him "Hold up thy left hand." Hereupon the high priest laid the two lots on the two goats, the one in the right hand on the goat at his right, and the one in the left hand on the animal at his left, exclaiming at the same time, "To the Lord a sin offering!"<p><span class= "bld">And the other lot for the scapegoat.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and the other lot for Azazel. </span>The word, which only occurs in this chapter, probably denotes the utterly banished demon, the prince of the evil spirits, who with his legions occupies the desert regions and desolated places. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-14.htm" title="The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-43.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.">Matthew 12:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-24.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he said, I will return to my house from where I came out.">Luke 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm" title="And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.">Revelation 18:2</a>.) As the removal or pardon of sin is often represented in the Bible by its being banished into the uttermost parts of the earth and seas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-19.htm" title="He will turn again, he will have compassion on us; he will subdue our iniquities; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.">Micah 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-12.htm" title="As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.">Psalm 103:12</a>), nothing could be more striking or convey to the people the idea of absolute forgiveness better than this symbolical act of sending the goat laden with the sins of the congregation to the wilderness, the abode of the prince of darkness, back to the author of all sin. The rendering, <span class= "ital">scapegoat, </span>is contrary to the manifest antithesis of the verse. If the one member "For Jehovah" denotes a person, the second member "For Azazel," which forms the contrast, must, <span class= "ital">prima facie, </span>also denote a person. Besides, the translation <span class= "ital">scapegoat </span>cannot be admitted in the next verse but one, where, if adopted, it would literally be "to send the goat to the scapegoat in the wilderness" .(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-10.htm" title="But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.">Leviticus 16:10</a>), or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-26.htm" title="And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.">Leviticus 16:26</a>, where it is, "and he who taketh away the goat to the scapegoat."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Without entering into particulars of the sacrifices on the great day of atonement, we may notice that it was to be a statute for ever, till that dispensation be at an end. As long as we are continually sinning, we continually need the atonement. The law of afflicting our souls for sin, is a statue which will continue in force till we arrive where all tears, even those of repentance, will be wiped from our eyes. The apostle observes it as a proof that the sacrifices could not take away sin, and cleanse the conscience from it, that in them there was a remembrance made of sin every year, upon the day of atonement, Heb 10:1,3. The repeating the sacrifices, showed there was in them but a feeble effort toward making atonement; this could be done only by offering up the body of Christ once for all; and that sacrifice needed not to be repeated.</body></html>
