This is a remarkable instance of Moses' humility, and of the human side of his nature as a lawgiver. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-6.htm" title="And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, and shall you sit here?">Numbers 32:6</a>, &c.) Hence Jewish tradition from time immemorial ascribes the mistake to Moses, and not to Aaron. The paraphrase of this verse in the Palestine Chaldee Version, which embodies the ancient opinions, is very instructive. It is as follows: "And when Moses heard it, he approved of this explanation. Whereupon he sent a herald through the whole camp of Israel, saying, It is I from whom the law had been hid, and my brother Aaron brought it to my remembrance."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-20 Afflictions should rather quicken us to our duty, than take us from it. But our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful, will have great allowances made for it; God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.</body></html>
