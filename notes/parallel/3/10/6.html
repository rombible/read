For this reason the priests who are consecrated to the service of the Lord are even on ordinary occasions not to shave their heads nor suffer their locks to grow long. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-20.htm" title="Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.">Ezekiel 44:20</a>.) On this occasion more especially Aaron and his two surviving sons are forbidden to give way to these manifestations of grief, since it might be considered as a reflection upon the justice of the punishment.<p><span class= "bld">Neither rend your clothes.</span>--This was another ordinary manifestation of sorrow and mourning. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm" title="And Reuben returned to the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.">Genesis 37:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-34.htm" title="And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-6.htm" title="And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust on their heads.">Joshua 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-21.htm" title="But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.">2Samuel 13:21</a>, &c.)

In virtue of the intimate connection which subsisted between the representative of the nation and the people, a sin committed by the high priest in his official position involved the whole community, and they had to share the consequences of the offence. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But let your brethren.</span>--The afflicted relatives were, however, not to be deprived of all the customary expressions of mourning.

What was it that God spake? Though Aaron's heart must have been filled with anguish and dismay, yet with silent submission he revered the justice of the stroke. When God corrects us or ours for sin, it is our duty to accept the punishment, and say, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good. Whenever we worship God, we come nigh unto him, as spiritual priests. This ought to make us very serious in all acts of devotion. It concerns us all, when we come nigh to God, to do every religious exercise, as those who believe that the God with whom we have to do, is a holy God. He will take vengeance on those that profane his sacred name by trifling with him.</body></html>
