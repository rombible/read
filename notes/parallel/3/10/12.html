As Aaron lost his two eldest sons in consequence of their having violated the sacrificial regulations, Moses is most anxious to guard him and his two younger sons against transgressing any other part of the ritual connected with the same sacrifices, lest they also should incur a similar punishment.<p><span class= "bld">Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings.</span>--The meat offering which was offered by the nation the day after the consecration, when the calamity happened (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm" title="And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it on the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.">Leviticus 9:17</a>), and which was not as yet eaten. With the exception of the handful which was burnt on the altar, all belonged to the priests. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/6-14.htm" title="And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.">Leviticus 6:14-18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And eat it without leaven beside the altar.</span>--That is, in the court of the tent of meeting, where the altar of burnt offering stood.

It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that touches them shall be holy.">Leviticus 6:18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-20.</span> - Moses takes care that the remaining part of the ritual of the day shall be carried out in spite of the terrible interruption that has occurred. Under his instructions, Aaron and Eleazar and Ithamar eat the remainder of <span class="cmt_word">the meat offering</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), in the court of the tabernacle, and reserve <span class="cmt_word">the wave breast</span> and <span class="cmt_word">heave shoulder</span> to <span class="cmt_word">eat in a clean place</span>, that is, not necessarily within the court; but he finds that the sin offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15</a>), which ought to be eaten by the priests, had been burnt. The rule was that, when the blood was presented in the tabernacle, the flesh was burned; when it was not, the flesh was eaten by the priests. In the present case, the blood had not been brought within the holy place, and yet the flesh had been burned instead of being eaten. Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, and demanded an explanation. Aaron's plea of defense was twofold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> His sons had fulfilled aright the ritual of their own sin offering and burnt offering, that is, the offerings made for the priests, and it had been rather his duty than theirs to see that the ritual of the sin offering of the congregation had been properly carried out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The state of distress in which he was, and the near escape that he had had from ceremonial defilement, and the sense of sin brought home to him by his children's death, had made him unfit and unable to eat the sin offering of the people, as he should have done under other circumstances. With this plea Moses was content. It was true that the letter of the Law had been broken, but there was a sufficient cause for it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>). It appears from hence that the expiation wrought by the sin offering was not complete until the whole ceremony was accomplished, the last act of which was the eating of the flesh by the priests in one class of sin offering, and the burning the flesh outside the camp in the other. It has been questioned, what is the full meaning of the expression, God hath given it you - the flesh of the sin offering - to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord. Archdeacon Freeman expresses the view of A Lapide, Keil, and many others when he says that, by eating the flesh of the offering, the priests "in a deep mystery neutralized, through the holiness vested in them by their consecration, the sin which the offerer had laid upon the victim and upon them" ('Principles of Divine Service,' part 2). Oehler, on the other hand (Herzog's 'Cyclop.,' 10), maintains that the priests did no more by this act than <span class="accented">declare</span> the removal of the sin already taken away; with which accords Philo's explanation ('De Vict.,' 13, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 6.) that the object of the sacrificial meal was to carry assurance of acceptance to the offerer, "since God would never have allowed his servants to partake of it had there not been a complete removal and forgetting of the sin atoned for." Neither of these explanations seems to be altogether satisfactory. The former attributes more meaning to the expression <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> than it appears to have elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>, where Aaron is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity of the holy things</span> and <span class="accented">of the sanctuary</span>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>, where the prophet is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> of Israel and Judah. The latter interpretation appears too much to evacuate the meaning of the words. It is quite certain that the part of the ceremony by which the atonement was wrought (if it was wrought by any one part) was the offering of the blood for the covering of the offerer's sins, but yet this action of the priests in eating the flesh of the victim was in some way also connected with the atonement, not only with the assurance of its having been wrought; but in what way this was effected we are not told, and cannot pronounce. The words <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> are equivalent to making atonement for by taking the sin in some sense upon themselves (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, "He shall bear their iniquities," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, "Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away [or beareth] the sin of the world'). Accordingly, Bishop Patrick comments: "The very eating of the people's sin offering argued the sins of the people were, <span class="accented">in some sort</span>, laid upon the priests, to be taken away by them. From whence the sacrifice of Christ may be explained, who is said to <span class="accented">bear our iniquity</span> (as the priest is here said to do), all our sins being laid on him, who took upon him to make an expiation for them by the sacrifice of himself. For the priest, hereby eating of the sin offering, receiving the guilt upon himself, may well be thought to prefigure One who should be both Priest and Sacrifice for sin; which was accomplished in Christ" (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-20 Afflictions should rather quicken us to our duty, than take us from it. But our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful, will have great allowances made for it; God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.</body></html>
