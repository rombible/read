Aaron, however, was fully sensible of this, and hence replies to the charge brought against his sons.<p><span class= "bld">They offered their sin offering.</span>--Before proceeding to the transgression with which they are thus charged, Aaron adverts to the fact that all the other sacrificial duties in which he and his sons were engaged on the same day, prior to the great calamity, were performed in strict accordance with the prescribed ritual. His sons assisting him had offered "their"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the people's--sin and burnt offerings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/9-15.htm" title="And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.">Leviticus 9:15-16</a>) thus far in due compliance with the requirements of the law, and hence could never have meant to transgress intentionally.<p><span class= "bld">And such things have befallen me.</span>--But whilst he, Eleazar, and Ithamar were thus duly performing the sacrificial rites, Nadab and Abihu, his other two sons, transgressed, and were suddenly struck down dead, thus overwhelming the survivors with sorrow, and rendering them unfit to partake of the sacrifices.<p><span class= "bld">And if I had eaten.</span>--Aaron submits that, unfitted as they thus were by mourning and the sense of their own sinfulness, if they had partaken of this solemn meal it would not have been acceptable to the Lord. In consequence of this declaration, the rule obtained during the second Temple, that when an ordinary priest heard of the death of a relative whilst on duty in the sanctuary, he had to cease from service, though he could not leave the precincts of the Temple otherwise he defiled the sacrifice; whilst the high priest, who could continue his sacred ministrations, was not allowed to partake of the sacrificial meal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-20 Afflictions should rather quicken us to our duty, than take us from it. But our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful, will have great allowances made for it; God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.</body></html>
