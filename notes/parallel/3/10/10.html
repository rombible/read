Thus, for instance, the rules as to which places and days and sundry portions of the offerings were holy or common, or as to holy fire and common fire, which Nadab and Abihu violated; or about ceremonially clean and unclean men, women, animals, and utensils. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-23.htm" title="And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.">Ezekiel 44:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Wine and other intoxicating liquors (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5e8;</span>, whence the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>, was made from dates, or barley, or honey) are forbidden to the priests during their ministrations, <span class="cmt_word">that they may pat a difference between holy and unholy</span>; that is, that their minds may not be confused, but be capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, what ought and what ought not to be done. Nadab and Abihu, on the contrary, had not distinguished between the sacred and profane fire, or between God's commands and their own unregulated impulses. If they had partaken too freely of the wine provided for the drink offerings, their sin would be similar to that of the Corinthians in their abuse of the Lord's Supper. As to the use of wine by the minister of God under the New Testament, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>.

During the time they ministered, the priests were forbidden it. It is required of gospel ministers, that they be not given to wine, 1Ti 3:3. It is, Lest ye die; die when ye are in drink. The danger of death, to which we are continually exposed, should engage all to be sober.</body></html>
