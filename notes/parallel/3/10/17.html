Accordingly the flesh of the sin offering is given to the priests, that by the act of eating it they may visibly show the offerer that God has graciously accepted the expiatory sacrifice, and that it is a most holy thing. The phrase "to bear iniquity" often signifies "to bear away, to remove, to forgive iniquity." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-17.htm" title="And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth,">Genesis 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm" title="Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.">Psalm 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-5.htm" title="I acknowledge my sin to you, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the LORD; and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.">Psalm 32:5</a>, &c.) Hence the most ancient Versions translate it here, "that ye may take <span class= "ital">away </span>or <span class= "ital">remove</span>" (LXX., the Chaldee, the Syriac, &c.). The rendering of the Authorised Version, however, is that of the Vulgate, which has been followed by the Reformers both in England and on the continent, as well as by several modern expositors. This is supported by the meaning of the phrase "to bear the iniquity" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm" title="And it shall be on Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.">Exodus 28:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father's house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.">Numbers 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/4-4.htm" title="Lie you also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it: according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it you shall bear their iniquity.">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>. Those who follow this rendering take the passage to mean that the priest, by eating or incorporating the victim on which the offerer had laid his guilt, actually took away the sin, or neutralised it in a mysterious way, by virtue of the sanctifying power belonging to the sacerdotal office. Others, again, who also take the phrase to mean that the priest literally takes the sin upon himself, do not explain it, but simply say, that by eating the sin-laden victim the sins of the offerer were, <span class= "ital">in some sort, </span>laid upon the priest to be taken away by him, thus prefiguring Christ, who should be both priest and sacrifice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:12-20 Afflictions should rather quicken us to our duty, than take us from it. But our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful, will have great allowances made for it; God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.</body></html>
