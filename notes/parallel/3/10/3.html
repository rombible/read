Having failed to do this, God sanctified himself in them by the awful punishment inflicted upon them for their transgression. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm" title="The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.">Ezekiel 27:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm" title="And you shall come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-23.htm" title="Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 38:23</a>.) The phrase, "that come near to God," is a frequent designation for the priest. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-22.htm" title="And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth on them.">Exodus 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm" title="And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near to him.">Numbers 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-13.htm" title="Then said he to me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach to the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.">Ezekiel 42:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-19.htm" title="And you shall give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach to me, to minister to me, said the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.">Ezekiel 43:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And before all the people I will be glorified.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and I will glorify myself before all the people. </span>By this judgment God vindicated His law, showing that it cannot be violated with impunity, and thus glorified Himself as the Holy One of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">And Aaron held his peace.</span>--He silently submitted to the righteous judgment which bereft him of his two sons. So the Psalmist, "I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm" title="I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because you did it.">Psalm 39:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is that the Lord spake</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-22.htm">Exodus 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33</a>). God will be sanctified either by the obedience or by the punishment of those <span class="cmt_word">that come nigh him</span>, that is, his priests. If they have greater privileges, they have greater perils (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Aaron held his peace</span> - in submission (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a>), acknowledging that Moses had justified the act of God in executing so terrible a judgment. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:3-7 The most quieting considerations under affliction are fetched from the word of God. What was it that God spake? Though Aaron's heart must have been filled with anguish and dismay, yet with silent submission he revered the justice of the stroke. When God corrects us or ours for sin, it is our duty to accept the punishment, and say, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good. Whenever we worship God, we come nigh unto him, as spiritual priests. This ought to make us very serious in all acts of devotion. It concerns us all, when we come nigh to God, to do every religious exercise, as those who believe that the God with whom we have to do, is a holy God. He will take vengeance on those that profane his sacred name by trifling with him.</body></html>
