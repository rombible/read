Accordingly, the Apostle enjoins that a bishop "must not be given to wine," that "deacons must not be given to much wine" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1Timothy 3:2-3</a>). A similar law existed among the ancient Greeks and Persians, enjoining the priests to abstain from wine.<p><span class= "bld">Nor strong drink.</span>--The word (<span class= "ital">sh?ch?r</span>) here rendered strong drink, is the general name of intoxicating drinks, whether made of wheat, barley, millet, apples, dates, honey, or other fruits. One of the four intoxicating drinks which are prohibited among the Mahommedans in India is called "Sachar."<p><span class= "bld">When ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">when ye go into the tent of meeting. </span>The Palestinian Chaldee adds here, "as thy sons did who died by the burning fire." The same precept is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-21.htm" title="Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.">Ezekiel 44:21</a>, "Neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter into the inner court." The injunction that on these particular occasions the priests are to abstain from taking it clearly implies that, ordinarily, when not going into the tent of meeting--that is, when not performing their sacred functions in the sanctuary--they were not forbidden to use it if required.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:8-11 Do not drink wine or strong drink. During the time they ministered, the priests were forbidden it. It is required of gospel ministers, that they be not given to wine, 1Ti 3:3. It is, Lest ye die; die when ye are in drink. The danger of death, to which we are continually exposed, should engage all to be sober.</body></html>
