The offenders are the two eldest sons of Aaron, who had received the high distinction to be invited to accompany their father and Moses to the summit of the hallowed mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a>); the lesson to the Israelites being that the priests, though mediators between God and the people, are beset with the same infirmities as the laity, and must not presume upon their office.<p><span class= "bld">Took either of them his censer.</span>--The sin of Nadab and Abihu was of a complicated nature, and involved and consisted of several transgressions:--(1) They each took <span class= "ital">his </span>own censer, and not the sacred utensil of the sanctuary. (2) They both offered it together, whereas the incense was only to be offered by one. (3) They presumptuously encroached upon the functions of the high priest; for according to the Law the high priest alone burnt incense <span class= "ital">in a censer. </span>(Sec <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-11.htm" title="And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.">Numbers 17:11</a>.) The ordinary priests only burnt it on the golden altar in the holy place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-7.htm" title="And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it.">Exodus 30:7-8</a>), or on the brazen altar as a part of the memorial. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/2-2.htm" title="And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of there his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD:">Leviticus 2:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-16.htm" title="And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 2:16</a>, &c.) The case of Korah and his company was an exception, since it was ordered by Moses for an especial purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/16-6.htm" title="This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;">Numbers 16:6-25</a>). (4) They offered the incense at an unauthorised time, since it was apart from the morning and evening sacrifice.<p><span class= "bld">And offered strange fire.</span>--They filled their vessels with common fire instead of taking it from the holy fire of the altar, which was always to be used in burning incense. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-24.htm" title="And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12</a>.) It is with reference to this practice that we are told--"And the angel took the censer and filled it with fire off the altar" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-5.htm" title="And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunder, and lightning, and an earthquake.">Revelation 8:5</a>). Ancient tradition says that Nadab and Abihu had partaken too freely of the drink offering, and performed their service in a state of intoxication, when they were incapacitated to distinguish between what was legal and illegal. So general was this tradition that it is actually embodied in the Palestinian Chaldee Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm" title="Do not drink wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:">Leviticus 10:9</a>, which contains the solemn warning against wine to those engaged in the service of the sanctuary, and which is regarded as a sequel to this awful catastrophe. Others, however, suppose that the phrase "strange fire" denotes not offered according to the prescribed law, just as "strange incense" is used in the sense of incense not prepared in the manner ordered by the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-9.htm" title="You shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall you pour drink offering thereon.">Exodus 30:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Before the Lord.</span>--This may mean before the door of the sanctuary (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a>), or in front of the holy of holies. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-6.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the veil of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 4:6</a>.) As the dead bodies are said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-4.htm" title="And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.">Leviticus 10:4</a> to have lain in the court of the tabernacle, the former must be the meaning in the passage before us.<p><span class= "bld">Which he commanded them not.</span>--According to a figure of speech frequently used in Hebrew, where the negative form is used for the emphatic affirmative, this phrase is better rendered, "which he had strongly forbidden them." Though the command is only expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12</a>, there can hardly be any doubt that it was previously given by Moses, since it is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm" title="And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire:">Leviticus 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-12.htm" title="And the fire on the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order on it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.">Leviticus 6:12</a>. A similar reference to a well known statement, though not here recorded, we have in the following verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nadab and Ahibu are said to have each taken his censer.</span> This is the first time that the word used in the original is translated "censer." It means any vessel or pan that will hold embers or tinder (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-23.htm">Exodus 37:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They put fire therein, and put incense thereon.</span> No doubt they used the incense ordered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34</a>. They are not found fault with for the incense, but for the fire that they used. <span class="cmt_word">They offered strange fire</span>, that is, fire not taken from the altar of burnt offering, which they might have feared to approach after the miracle that had occurred. In chapter Leviticus 16:12 it is ordered that, on the Day of Atonement, the incense fire should be taken from the brazen altar, and this was no doubt the rule on all occasions, though the law has not been recorded. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1,2 Next to Moses and Aaron, none were more likely to be honourable in Israel than Nadab and Abihu. There is reason to think that they were puffed up with pride, and that they were heated with wine. While the people were prostrate before the Lord, adoring his presence and glory, they rushed into the tabernacle to burn incense, though not at the appointed time; both together, instead of one alone, and with fire not taken from the altar. If it had been done through ignorance, they had been allowed to bring a sin-offering. But the soul that doeth presumptuously, and in contempt of God's majesty and justice, that soul shall be cut off. The wages of sin is death. They died in the very act of their sin. The sin and punishment of these priests showed the imperfection of that priesthood from the very beginning, and that it could not shelter any from the fire of God's wrath, otherwise than as it was typical of Christ's priesthood.</body></html>
