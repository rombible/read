Eleazar and Ithamar, as ordinary priests, might have been employed in removing the remains of their slain brothers. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/21-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to the priests the sons of Aaron, and say to them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:">Leviticus 21:1-4</a>) Naturally they were too much affected by this appalling scene; Moses therefore wanted to spare their feelings, and hence charged their cousins-german with the task of carrying away the dead bodies. The reason why Izar and Hebron, the two older uncles of Aaron, are here passed over is because the discontent of their children with the choice of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood, which afterward broke out in open rebellion on the part of Korah, Izar's son (Numbers 16, 17), had evidently begun to show itself when they witnessed the imposing ceremonies of the consecration. It was necessary that those who suffered so signally for the transgression of the Divine institutions should be buried by men whose allegiance to God's law was unimpeachable.<p><span class= "bld">Carry your brethren.</span>--That is, your kinsmen. The expression brother is frequently used in the Bible in the sense of near relation. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-8.htm" title="And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we be brothers.">Genesis 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-6.htm" title="And the Horites in their mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.">Genesis 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-48.htm" title="And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter to his son.">Genesis 24:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/29-12.htm" title="And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.">Genesis 29:12-15</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">From before the sanctuary.</span>--In the courtyard of the sanctuary, where the incense was offered in the midst of the rejoicing people, and where they were struck dead. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-5.htm" title="And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.">Leviticus 9:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Uzziel</span> was the youngest brother of Amram (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18-22</a>). His sons, <span class="cmt_word">Mishael and Elzaphan</span>, were therefore second cousins of <span class="cmt_word">Nadab and Abihu</span>, who are here called their <span class="cmt_word">brethren</span>. (Cf. the use of the term "brothers of the Lord," applied probably to his first cousins in the New Testament.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:3-7 The most quieting considerations under affliction are fetched from the word of God. What was it that God spake? Though Aaron's heart must have been filled with anguish and dismay, yet with silent submission he revered the justice of the stroke. When God corrects us or ours for sin, it is our duty to accept the punishment, and say, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good. Whenever we worship God, we come nigh unto him, as spiritual priests. This ought to make us very serious in all acts of devotion. It concerns us all, when we come nigh to God, to do every religious exercise, as those who believe that the God with whom we have to do, is a holy God. He will take vengeance on those that profane his sacred name by trifling with him.</body></html>
