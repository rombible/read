Hence the authorities during the second Temple regarded it as "embodying the Decalogue," for which reason, as well as for the fact that "it contains the sum and substance of the precepts of the Law, it is read in public." The precepts in this chapter are divided into sixteen groups, eight of which end with the emphatic reiteration, "I am the Lord your God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-2.htm" title="Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, You shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.">Leviticus 19:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-10.htm" title="And you shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather every grape of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-25.htm" title="And in the fifth year shall you eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield to you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm" title="Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-34.htm" title="But the stranger that dwells with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-36.htm" title="Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall you have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.">Leviticus 19:36</a>), and eight with the shorter formula, "I am the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-14.htm" title="You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shall fear your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-16.htm" title="You shall not go up and down as a talebearer among your people: neither shall you stand against the blood of your neighbor; I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm" title="You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm" title="You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks on you: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-30.htm" title="You shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-32.htm" title="You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-37.htm" title="Therefore shall you observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:37</a>).<p>From the prohibition of moral uncleanness exhibiting itself in the form of incest and licentiousness, the legislator proceeds to a series of laws and commandments against other kinds of immorality, inculcating piety, righteousness, and kindness. Chapter 19 may be regarded as an extension of the previous chapter in this direction, after which the subject of chapter 18, is again taken up in chapter 20. The precepts now given are not arranged systematically, though, as Keil has remarked, "while grouped together rather according to a loose association of ideas than according to any logical arrangement, they are all linked together by the common purpose expressed in the words, <span class="accented">Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.' "</span> They begin by inculcating (in verses 3, 4) duties which fall under the heads of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the fifth commandment of the Decalogue, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the fourth, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the first, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the second. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These four laws are, in their positive aspects, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the religious law of social order, on which a commonwealth rests; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the law of positive obedience to God's command because it is his command; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the law of piety towards the invisible Lord; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the law of faith, which trusts him without requiring risible emblems or pictures of him. In verses 11, 14, 16, 35, 36, obedience is inculcated to the eighth and the ninth commandments, which are the laws of honesty and of truthfulness; in verse 12 to the third commandment, which is the law of reverence; in verses 17, 18, 33, 34, to the sixth commandment, which is the law of love; in verses 20, 29, to the seventh commandment, which is the law of purity; in verses 9, 10, 13, the spirit of covetousness is prohibited, as forbidden in the tenth commandment, which is the law of charity. Thus this chapter may in a way be regarded as the Old Testament counterpart of the Sermon on the Mount, inasmuch as it lays down the laws of conduct, as the latter lays down the principles of action, in as comprehensive though not in so systematic a manner as the ten commandments. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-37 laws. - There are some ceremonial precepts in this chapter, but most of these precepts are binding on us, for they are explanations of the ten commandments. It is required that Israel be a holy people, because the God of Israel is a holy God, ver. 2. To teach real separation from the world and the flesh, and entire devotedness to God. This is now the law of Christ; may the Lord bring every thought within us into obedience to it! Children are to be obedient to their parents, ver. 3. The fear here required includes inward reverence and esteem, outward respect and obedience, care to please them and to make them easy. God only is to be worshipped, ver. 4. Turn not from the true God to false ones, from the God who will make you holy and happy, to those that will deceive you, and make you for ever miserable. Turn not your eyes to them, much less your heart. They should leave the gleanings of their harvest and vintage for the poor, ver. 9. Works of piety must be always attended with works of charity, according to our ability. We must not be covetous, griping, and greedy of every thing we can lay claim to, nor insist upon our right in all things. We are to be honest and true in all our dealings, ver. 11. Whatever we have in the world, we must see that we get it honestly, for we cannot be truly rich, or long rich, with that which is not so. Reverence to the sacred name of God must be shown, ver. 12. We must not detain what belongs to another, particularly the wages of the hireling, ver. 13. We must be tender of the credit and safety of those that cannot help themselves, ver. 14. Do no hurt to any, because they are unwilling or unable to avenge themselves. We ought to take heed of doing any thing which may occasion our weak brother to fall. The fear of God should keep us from doing wrong things, though they will not expose us to men's anger. Judges, and all in authority, are commanded to give judgment without partiality, ver. 15. To be a tale-bearer, and to sow discord among neighbours, is as bad an office as a man can put himself into. We are to rebuke our neighbour in love, ver. 17. Rather rebuke him than hate him, for an injury done to thyself. We incur guilt by not reproving; it is hating our brother. We should say, I will do him the kindness to tell him of his faults. We are to put off all malice, and to put on brotherly love, ver. 18. We often wrong ourselves, but we soon forgive ourselves those wrongs, and they do not at all lessen our love to ourselves; in like manner we should love our neighbour. We must in many cases deny ourselves for the good of our neighbour. Ver. 31: For Christians to have their fortunes told, to use spells and charms, or the like, is a sad affront to God. They must be grossly ignorant who ask, What harm is there in these things? Here is a charge to young people to show respect to the aged, ver. 32. Religion teaches good manners, and obliges us to honour those to whom honour is due. A charge was given to the Israelites to be very tender of strangers, ver. 33. Strangers, and the widows and fatherless, are God's particular care. It is at our peril, if we do them any wrong. Strangers shall be welcome to God's grace; we should do what we can to recommend religion to them. Justice in weights and measures is commanded, ver. 35. We must make conscience of obeying God's precepts. We are not to pick and choose our duty, but must aim at standing complete in all the will of God. And the nearer our lives and tempers are to the precepts of God's law, the happier shall we be, and the happier shall we make all around us, and the better shall we adorn the gospel.</body></html>
