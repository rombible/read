In illustration of this precept the Jewish canonists remark, "when any man sinneth against another he must not inwardly hate him and keep silence, as it is said of the wicked, 'And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-22.htm" title="And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.">2Samuel 13:22</a>); but he is commanded to make it known unto him, and to say, 'Why hast thou done thus unto me?'" Similar is the admonition of Christ, "If thy brother sin against thee rebuke him, and if he repent forgive him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-3.htm" title="Take heed to yourselves: If your brother trespass against you, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.">Luke 17:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And not suffer sin upon him.</span>--Better <span class= "ital">so that thou bear not sin on his account. </span>That is, by not reproving him, but harbouring inward hatred towards the offender, we not only become partakers of his offence, but incur the sin of bearing secret ill-will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm" title="Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.">Romans 1:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-26.htm" title="Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down on your wrath:">Ephesians 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-20.htm" title="Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.">1Timothy 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1Timothy 5:22</a>). According to the spiritual authorities during the second Temple, however, this clause denotes, "but thou shalt bear no sin by reason of it," as the Authorised Version translates this phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-32.htm" title="And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall you pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest you die.">Numbers 18:32</a>; that is, "execute the duty of reproof in such a manner that thou dost not incur sin by it," which they explain in the following manner: "Even if the reproof is ineffectual the first time, it must be repeated over and over again, but the rebuker must desist as soon as he sees blushes on the offender's face, for it shows that the reproofs have made an impression. Every step taken by the one who reproves, after the offender has thus indicated by his countenance that he realises the offence, is an unnecessary humiliation, and hence brings sin upon him who rebukes by reason of it."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - On the one side we are not to <span class="cmt_word">hate our brother in our heart,</span> whatever wrongs he may commit; but on the other side, we are <span class="cmt_word">in any wise to rebuke our neighbour</span> for his wrong doing. So our Lord teaches, "if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-3.htm">Luke 17:3</a>); and he appoints a solemn mode of procedure, by which this fraternal rebuke is to be conveyed in his Church: "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). Therefore St. Paul warns his delegates, Timothy and Titus, "Them that sin rebuke before all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>). "Reprove, rebuke" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>). "Rebuke them sharply" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm">Titus 1:13</a>). "Rebuke with all authority" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-15.htm">Titus 2:15</a>). By withholding reproof in a bitter spirit, or from a feeling of cowardice, we may become partakers of other men's sins. Whoever fails to rebuke his neighbour when he ought to do so, <span class="accented">bears sin on his account</span> (the more correct and less ambiguous rendering of the words translated in the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">suffer sin upon him</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-22.htm">Numbers 18:22, 32</a>). God's people are their brothers' keepers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-9.htm">Genesis 4:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-37 laws. - There are some ceremonial precepts in this chapter, but most of these precepts are binding on us, for they are explanations of the ten commandments. It is required that Israel be a holy people, because the God of Israel is a holy God, ver. 2. To teach real separation from the world and the flesh, and entire devotedness to God. This is now the law of Christ; may the Lord bring every thought within us into obedience to it! Children are to be obedient to their parents, ver. 3. The fear here required includes inward reverence and esteem, outward respect and obedience, care to please them and to make them easy. God only is to be worshipped, ver. 4. Turn not from the true God to false ones, from the God who will make you holy and happy, to those that will deceive you, and make you for ever miserable. Turn not your eyes to them, much less your heart. They should leave the gleanings of their harvest and vintage for the poor, ver. 9. Works of piety must be always attended with works of charity, according to our ability. We must not be covetous, griping, and greedy of every thing we can lay claim to, nor insist upon our right in all things. We are to be honest and true in all our dealings, ver. 11. Whatever we have in the world, we must see that we get it honestly, for we cannot be truly rich, or long rich, with that which is not so. Reverence to the sacred name of God must be shown, ver. 12. We must not detain what belongs to another, particularly the wages of the hireling, ver. 13. We must be tender of the credit and safety of those that cannot help themselves, ver. 14. Do no hurt to any, because they are unwilling or unable to avenge themselves. We ought to take heed of doing any thing which may occasion our weak brother to fall. The fear of God should keep us from doing wrong things, though they will not expose us to men's anger. Judges, and all in authority, are commanded to give judgment without partiality, ver. 15. To be a tale-bearer, and to sow discord among neighbours, is as bad an office as a man can put himself into. We are to rebuke our neighbour in love, ver. 17. Rather rebuke him than hate him, for an injury done to thyself. We incur guilt by not reproving; it is hating our brother. We should say, I will do him the kindness to tell him of his faults. We are to put off all malice, and to put on brotherly love, ver. 18. We often wrong ourselves, but we soon forgive ourselves those wrongs, and they do not at all lessen our love to ourselves; in like manner we should love our neighbour. We must in many cases deny ourselves for the good of our neighbour. Ver. 31: For Christians to have their fortunes told, to use spells and charms, or the like, is a sad affront to God. They must be grossly ignorant who ask, What harm is there in these things? Here is a charge to young people to show respect to the aged, ver. 32. Religion teaches good manners, and obliges us to honour those to whom honour is due. A charge was given to the Israelites to be very tender of strangers, ver. 33. Strangers, and the widows and fatherless, are God's particular care. It is at our peril, if we do them any wrong. Strangers shall be welcome to God's grace; we should do what we can to recommend religion to them. Justice in weights and measures is commanded, ver. 35. We must make conscience of obeying God's precepts. We are not to pick and choose our duty, but must aim at standing complete in all the will of God. And the nearer our lives and tempers are to the precepts of God's law, the happier shall we be, and the happier shall we make all around us, and the better shall we adorn the gospel.</body></html>
