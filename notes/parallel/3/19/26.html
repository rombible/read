It prohibits (1) eating the flesh of a legally slaughtered animal as long as its life is not quite gone, or whilst the flesh is still trembling; (2) eating the flesh of sacrificial animals whilst the blood is still in the sprinkling bowl, and before it has been sprinkled on the altar; (3) eating the meat of mourners by the relatives when a member of the family has been publicly executed, and his blood has been shed; (4) eating anything by the judicial court on the day when their sentence of death is being executed on the criminal; and (5) it warns the rebellious and gluttonous son not to eat immoderately by the penalty of blood." The ancient Chaldee Version, therefore, which translates it "Ye shall not eat the flesh of any sacrifice whilst the blood is in the basin unsprinkled," exhibits the second of these prohibitions involved in this interpretation; and all the five premise the rendering of this phrase, "Ye shall not eat by the blood," which has the merit of being literal; whilst the Authorised Version follows the first of these five prohibitions. Others, again, who also translate it "Ye shall not eat by the blood," take it as a prohibition of the idolatrous practice which obtained among the Zabii, who, to obtain favour from the demons, gathered the blood of the sacrifices which they offered to them into a vessel or a hole dug in the earth, and then sat around it to consume the sacrificial meal by the blood, thinking that thereby they fraternised with these demons. This seems to be favoured by the next clause.<p><span class= "bld">Neither shall ye use enchantment.- </span>Better, <span class= "ital">ye shall use no enchantment. </span>According to the authorities during the second Temple, this consisted in any one saying, "A morsel has dropped out of my mouth; the staff has fallen out of my hand; my child has called out behind me; a crow has cawed to me; a deer has crossed my path; a serpent crept on my right hand; a fox has gone by on my left;" and regarding these as bad omens for the day which has now began or for the work which he has just commenced. Or if he says to the man who raises the taxes, "Do not begin with me; it is still early in the day; it is the first of the month; it is the beginning of the week; I shall be unlucky the whole day, week, or month to be the first to be burdened;" this is enchantment.<p><span class= "bld">Nor observe times.</span>--This, according to the same authorities, consists in "taking notice of the seasons and days, and in saying this is a good day to begin <span class= "bld">a </span>journey, to-morrow will be lucky to make a purchase."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-28.</span> - After a repetition of the fundamental ceremonial law against eating things which have the blood in them (the LXX. rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "upon the mountains," arises from a mistaken reading), follow prohibitions <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to <span class="cmt_word">use enchantment</span>, literally, <span class="accented">to whisper or mutter after holding communication with serpents</span> (if the word <span class="accented">nichesh</span> be derived from <span class="accented">nachash</span>, a serpent); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to <span class="cmt_word">observe times</span>, or rather, according to a more probable etymology, <span class="accented">exercise the evil eye</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to <span class="cmt_word">round the corners of your heads</span>, that is, use a sort of tonsure, as was done by some Arabian tribes (Herod., 3:3) in honour of their god Orotal, and by the Israelites as a form of mourning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> to mar the corners of thy beard, a fashion of mourning which accompanied the tonsure of the head (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> to make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, another form of mourning, associated with the two previously mentioned practices (see chapter Leviticus 21:5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-3.htm">Jeremiah 41:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> to print any marks upon you, that is, tattoo themselves in memory of the dead.

It is required that Israel be a holy people, because the God of Israel is a holy God, ver. 2. To teach real separation from the world and the flesh, and entire devotedness to God. This is now the law of Christ; may the Lord bring every thought within us into obedience to it! Children are to be obedient to their parents, ver. 3. The fear here required includes inward reverence and esteem, outward respect and obedience, care to please them and to make them easy. God only is to be worshipped, ver. 4. Turn not from the true God to false ones, from the God who will make you holy and happy, to those that will deceive you, and make you for ever miserable. Turn not your eyes to them, much less your heart. They should leave the gleanings of their harvest and vintage for the poor, ver. 9. Works of piety must be always attended with works of charity, according to our ability. We must not be covetous, griping, and greedy of every thing we can lay claim to, nor insist upon our right in all things. We are to be honest and true in all our dealings, ver. 11. Whatever we have in the world, we must see that we get it honestly, for we cannot be truly rich, or long rich, with that which is not so. Reverence to the sacred name of God must be shown, ver. 12. We must not detain what belongs to another, particularly the wages of the hireling, ver. 13. We must be tender of the credit and safety of those that cannot help themselves, ver. 14. Do no hurt to any, because they are unwilling or unable to avenge themselves. We ought to take heed of doing any thing which may occasion our weak brother to fall. The fear of God should keep us from doing wrong things, though they will not expose us to men's anger. Judges, and all in authority, are commanded to give judgment without partiality, ver. 15. To be a tale-bearer, and to sow discord among neighbours, is as bad an office as a man can put himself into. We are to rebuke our neighbour in love, ver. 17. Rather rebuke him than hate him, for an injury done to thyself. We incur guilt by not reproving; it is hating our brother. We should say, I will do him the kindness to tell him of his faults. We are to put off all malice, and to put on brotherly love, ver. 18. We often wrong ourselves, but we soon forgive ourselves those wrongs, and they do not at all lessen our love to ourselves; in like manner we should love our neighbour. We must in many cases deny ourselves for the good of our neighbour. Ver. 31: For Christians to have their fortunes told, to use spells and charms, or the like, is a sad affront to God. They must be grossly ignorant who ask, What harm is there in these things? Here is a charge to young people to show respect to the aged, ver. 32. Religion teaches good manners, and obliges us to honour those to whom honour is due. A charge was given to the Israelites to be very tender of strangers, ver. 33. Strangers, and the widows and fatherless, are God's particular care. It is at our peril, if we do them any wrong. Strangers shall be welcome to God's grace; we should do what we can to recommend religion to them. Justice in weights and measures is commanded, ver. 35. We must make conscience of obeying God's precepts. We are not to pick and choose our duty, but must aim at standing complete in all the will of God. And the nearer our lives and tempers are to the precepts of God's law, the happier shall we be, and the happier shall we make all around us, and the better shall we adorn the gospel.</body></html>
