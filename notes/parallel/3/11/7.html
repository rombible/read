Having given these illustrations of animals which comply with the first condition only--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>which are ruminant but not bisulcous--and hence must not be eaten, the lawgiver now concludes the list of prohibited quadrupeds with an illustration of a contrary nature--viz., the swine, which comply with the second condition only, but not with the first. Here, too, the description is according to appearance. The feet of the pig tribe generally have four toes enclosed in separate hoofs. The two middle hoofs, however, are much larger, and are divided by a deep cleft, and hence to all appearances the swine is bisulcous. Though the law before us simply describes the swine as wanting in one of the two criteria, like the camel, the coney, and the hare, yet the abhorrence which the Jews, as a nation, have always had of this animal, and the impurity which they have ascribed to it infinitely surpass their repulsion of any other unclean beast. For this reason it became the symbol of defilement and the badge of insult (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-4.htm" title="Blessed is the man whom you choose, and cause to approach to you, that he may dwell in your courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, even of your holy temple.">Psalm 65:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-3.htm" title="Say to God, How terrible are you in your works! through the greatness of your power shall your enemies submit themselves to you.">Psalm 66:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-17.htm" title="I cried to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.">Psalm 66:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-22.htm" title="As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.">Proverbs 11:22</a>). The eating of pork was regarded as renouncing the Law, and as a sign of apostasy. Hence Antiochus Epiphanes adopted it as a test that those Jews who ate it had forsaken their religion and submitted to his rule. Hence we read that when swine's flesh was forced into the mouth of Eleazar, the aged scribe, he "spit it forth, choosing rather to die gloriously than to live stained with such an abomination<span class= "ital">" </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-18.htm" title="Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of a well favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and to eat swine's flesh.">2 Maccabees 6:18-19</a>). During the time of the commonwealth there were no swine in Judea. Hence it was in a "far country" that the prodigal son was sent into the field to feed the swine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/15-13.htm" title="And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.">Luke 15:13-15</a>). The swine in Galilee in our Lord's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-30.htm" title="And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.">Matthew 8:30</a>) were undoubtedly kept by Gentiles for the Roman legion. The very name of swine (<span class= "ital">chazir</span>) was discarded, and the animal was designated by the euphemistic expression, "the other thing." This "brutish of all animals" was, moreover, regarded as propagating cutaneous and many other disorders. The Talmud declares that "ten measures of pestilential diseases were spread over the earth, and nine of them fell to the share of pigs." On the other hand, many of the Pagan nations regarded the swine as an emblem of the productive power of nature. Hence they sacrificed them to those deities to whom they ascribed the fertility of the soil, and the fruitfulness of cattle. Thus, the Egyptians offered them in honour of Isis and Osiris once a year at the festival of the full moon. The Athenians, too, offered the swine in their mysteries; so did the Boetians and the early Romans.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted.</span> Here, again, the description is not according to anatomical analysis, but to ordinary appearance. The pig appears to be cloven-footed, and it would be misleading to give any other account of his foot in ordinary speech, but scientifically speaking, he has four toes. The prohibition of the use of swine's flesh does not arise from the fear of trichinosis or other disease, but from the disgust caused by the carnivorous and filthy habits of the Eastern pig. The repulsion originally felt for swine's flesh was natural, and, where the animal is carnivorous, is still natural, but where its habits are changed, and it has become simply graminivorous, the feeling has ceased to exist. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
