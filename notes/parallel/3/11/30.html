Its skin in ancient days was tied round the udder of cows to prevent other reptiles sucking out their milk. There can, therefore, be no doubt that the administrators of the law took it to be the hedgehog. Some ancient versions, however, render it by shrew mouse, whilst some modern expositors make it the gecko.<p><span class= "bld">And the chameleon.</span>--The ancient versions agree that by this animal (<span class= "ital">khoach</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which denotes "strength," and which occurs nowhere else in the Bible as the name of a reptile, is meant the chameleon. Its power of enduring for a long time without food, which led the ancients to believe that it entirely subsisted upon air, may be the cause both of its Hebrew name (as specified above), and the name chameleon, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"a lion on the ground," a reptile with the strength of a lion, The belief that it lives upon the air had also given rise to its Aramaic name in the time of Christ (<span class= "ital">zekitha</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which denotes the animal that fills itself with air. The perplexity which the administrators of the law experienced about its food, and the time of feeding this creature, may be gathered from the story in the Talmud attributed to one of the sons of Noah, of what happened in the Ark. Sem, the son of Noah, said, "We had much trouble with the chameleon, for whilst we fed the day animals by day and the night animals by night, we did not know what the chameleon fed on. One day, however, I broke open a pomegranate, and a worm fell out of it, which the creature immediately devoured. Afterwards I pounded together fruit, and when it bred maggots the chameleon ate them." The common chameleon is found in Syria and Palestine, and some eastern tribes believe that its flesh when eaten boiled is a remedy for leanness, and if eaten dry cures fever. In Spain chameleons are kept in rooms to destroy troublesome flies.<p><span class= "bld">And the lizard.</span>--Though the ancient authorities agree that the creature here named (<span class= "ital">l'taah</span>) is lizard, yet the description which the administrators of the law give of it, does not enable us to define the species to which it belongs. The characteristics which they give of the lizard are as follows: It has a thick though soft and smooth skin, and lays eggs in which the yolk and the white are not separated. Its tail when cut off will move for some time afterwards, and the creature itself when apparently dead will sometimes revive by pouring cold water over it.<p><span class= "bld">And the snail.</span>--This meaning of the Hebrew name (<span class= "ital">chomet</span>) is attested by the highest Jewish authorities of ancient times. It denotes the testaceous kinds, whilst the word (<span class= "ital">shabbel</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-8.htm" title="As a snail which melts, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.">Psalm 58:8</a> describes the naked species. Snails abound in a great variety of species in the East, and some kinds were eaten by the ancients as a great luxury. It was believed that the slime which it constantly emits as it crawls along brings about its death by a process of dissolution. Hence the remark "and snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-8.htm" title="As a snail which melts, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.">Psalm 58:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the mole.</span>--The word (<span class= "ital">tinshemeth</span>) here translated "mole" is the same which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-18.htm" title="And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,">Leviticus 11:18</a> for an unclean bird. That the Authorised Version, however, gives the correct rendering of the word is not only attested by the ancient versions, but by the following description, which the administrators of the law in the time of Christ give of the reptile here intended. It has no eyes, and burrows into the earth, and destroys the roots. For this reason, as well as for its carrying quantities of corn to its nest, it was ordained during the second Temple that the creature may be killed on the middle days of the two pilgrim festivals, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the Feasts of Passover and of Tabernacles. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-20.htm" title="In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;">Isaiah 2:20</a>, however, which is the only other passage where the mole occurs in the Hebrew Scriptures, the name for it is <span class= "ital">cnapar perah. </span>We have already seen in the case of the snail that two different names for the same creature are used designedly to describe the different characteristics of the same animal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
