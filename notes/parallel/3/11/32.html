(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-25.htm" title="And whoever bears ought of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:25</a>.) According to the law which obtained during the second Temple it was only when the portion of the carcase of an unclean animal had flesh on it that it defiled, but not otherwise. Hence the skins, hair, bones, horns, hoofs, sinews, &c. of all unclean creatures were exempted. These were made into different domestic utensils and implements. The use thus made of the parts in question also constituted one of the differences between the Pharisees and the Sadducees in the time of Christ. The Sadducees regarded every portion of every unclean animal in whatever state as defiling, and hence prohibited its being made up into any vessel.<p><span class= "bld">Vessel of wood.</span>--That is, vessels made of bulrushes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-2.htm" title="That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes on the waters, saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!">Isaiah 18:2</a>), reeds, wicker, shells of nuts, barks of trees, or of anything which grew out of the earth like wood.<p><span class= "bld">Or raiment.</span>--That is, any garment made of a woven material, such as wool, flax, hemp, or anything which grows on the dry land. Hence cloth made of a material which grows in the sea was not defiled, according to the canons which obtained during the second Temple.<p><span class= "bld">Or skin.</span>--This also, according to the same authorities, only applied to the skins of land animals; skins of aquatic creatures received no defilement.<p><span class= "bld">Or</span> <span class= "bld">sack.</span>--From the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-20.htm" title="And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.">Numbers 31:20</a>, we see that by this expression here is meant garments made of stuffs of goats' hair, in contradistinction to the textures of which the garments were made, denoted by the expression <span class= "ital">beged, </span>"raiment." (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>.) Skins which were not made into garments or vessels, or which exhibited unfinished vessels, received no pollution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
