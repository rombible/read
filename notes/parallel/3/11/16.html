It dwells amongst desolated places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-13.htm" title="And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-39.htm" title="Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelled in from generation to generation.">Jeremiah 50:39</a>), fills the air with its doleful and hideous wails (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm" title="Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.">Micah 1:8</a>) and cruelly neglects its eggs to be hatched by the sun or trodden down under foot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm" title="Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.">Lamentations 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/39-17.htm" title="Because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding.">Job 39:17-18</a>). Owing to its proverbial stupidity, this hybrid is selected with another monster to illustrate the abundant goodness of the Lord, by showing that even this creature will become sensible of gratitude and break forth into thanksgiving and praise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-20.htm" title="The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.">Isaiah 43:20</a>). The flesh of the ostrich was eaten by the ancient Ethiopians, Indians, and other nations. The Romans regarded ostrich brains as a great delicacy. The ostrich occasionally devours fowls and other small vertebrates like a bird of prey, and tradition assures us that ostriches consumed the body of Agag.<p><span class= "bld">And the night hawk.</span>--Of all the unclean birds constituting this list, the one here rendered night hawk is the most difficult to identify. The name in the original (<span class= "ital">tachmas</span>) simply describes the bird as "the violent" one, or the rapacious, or "the cruel," and this designation would apply to any bird of prey not already specified in this catalogue. Hence it has alternately been taken for the owl, the night hawk, the male ostrich, the falcon, the seabird gannet, the cuckoo, and the swallow. It will, however, be seen that all the large birds of prey which are here hazarded, have either already been mentioned or are mentioned in the sequel of this list, whilst the small birds, viz., the cuckoo and the swallow, are too insignificant and too harmless to be placed between the large raptorial companions. In this uncertainty of opinion it is best to leave the Authorised Version alone. The name only occurs again in the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-15.htm" title="And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And the cuckow.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and the sea-gull. </span>Like the foregoing bird of prey, the <span class= "ital">shachaph </span>here mentioned only occurs again in the duplicate list of unclean animals in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-15.htm" title="And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>. It literally means the <span class= "ital">thin, slender, </span>or <span class= "ital">cadaverous </span>bird, and is taken by the most ancient authorities to denote the sea-gull, which is "the raven of the sea." It darts down with great velocity upon its victim, like a bird of prey. It not only eats fishes, insects, and smaller aquatic animals, but feeds upon carrion. The eggs of the gulls and the flesh of the young birds are to this day eaten both in the East and in some northern countries of Europe.<p><span class= "bld">And the hawk.--</span>Besides the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-15.htm" title="And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>, the hawk (<span class= "ital">netz</span>) also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-26.htm" title="Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?">Job 39:26</a>, where it is described as a migratory bird, since it migrates to a more southern climate on the approach of winter. It feeds upon mammals, birds, and amphibia, and attacks even its own parent, mate, and offspring. It abounds in a variety of species in all parts of Asia. Hence the remark "after his kind." Some tribes regard the flesh of the hawk as very palatable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
