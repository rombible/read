It occurs no less than twenty-four times, and is in four instances wrongly rendered in the Authorised Version by "grasshopper" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm" title="For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.">Judges 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm" title="Can you make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.">Job 39:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-23.htm" title="They shall cut down her forest, said the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.">Jeremiah 46:23</a>). It is the locust which constituted the eighth plague of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/10-4.htm" title="Else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into your coast:">Exodus 10:4-19</a>); which is described as committing the terrible ravages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm" title="You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-4.htm" title="That which the palmerworm has left has the locust eaten; and that which the locust has left has the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm has left has the caterpillar eaten.">Joel 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm" title="And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.">Joel 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-7.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that all they that look on you shall flee from you, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? from where shall I seek comforters for you?">Nahum 3:7</a>); and which swarmed in such innumerable quantities that it became a proverb in the Bible, "like the locusts in multitude" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-23.htm" title="They shall cut down her forest, said the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.">Jeremiah 46:23</a>). From these characteristics the <span class= "ital">arbe </span>is supposed to be the flying migratory locust. The administrators of the law in the time of Christ described the <span class= "ital">arbe </span>by the name <span class= "ital">gubai, </span>which is the species most commonly eaten, and ordained the following benediction to be recited before eating it: "Blessed be He by whose word everything was created." The locusts which are still eaten by the Jews and other Eastern nations are prepared in different ways. Generally they are thrown alive into a pot of boiling water mixed with salt, and taken out after a few minutes, when the heads, feet, and wings are plucked off, and the trunks are dried in an oven or in the sun on the roofs of houses, and are kept in bags for winter use. They are also broiled or stewed, or fried in butter; or they are mixed with butter and spread on thin cakes of bread. In taste they resemble shrimps or prawns. There are shops in some Eastern towns where they only sell locusts, strung upon cords or by measure. The locusts thus form an antidote to the famine they create by the devastation which they commit. They formed, along with "wild honey," the food of John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the bald locust.</span>--This is the only place where <span class= "ital">salam, </span>which is the name in the original, occurs as one of the edible kinds of leaping insects. Any attempt to identify the species is simply conjecture, since all which tradition tells us about it is that this kind of locust "has no tail but has a hump."<p><span class= "bld">The beetle.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the hopping locust. </span>Though it is difficult to identify the exact species, as the name (<span class= "ital">chargol</span>) does not occur again in the Bible, yet it is perfectly certain that a sort of locust is here intended, since the context clearly shows that four different kinds of the same insect are enumerated. This is moreover confirmed by the administrators of the law in the time of Christ, who assure us the <span class= "ital">chargol </span>is a species of locust having both a hump and a tail, the eggs of which Jewish women suspended in the ear as a remedy against ear-ache. This shows that it must have been a very large kind, and as the name denotes <span class= "ital">the galloping </span>or <span class= "ital">hopping one, </span>it is evidently designed to describe an unwinged species.<p><span class= "bld">The grasshopper.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the small locust. </span>This name (<span class= "ital">chagab</span>) occurs four times more in the Bible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm" title="And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm" title="If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;">2Chronicles 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm" title="Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm" title="It is he that sits on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:">Isaiah 40:22</a>), and is only in one place rightly rendered by <span class= "ital">locust </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm" title="If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;">2Chronicles 7:13</a>) in the Authorised Version. From the fact that it is described as laying waste the fields (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm" title="If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;">2Chronicles 7:13</a>), and that its insignificant appearance is contrasted with giant men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm" title="And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.">Numbers 13:33</a>) and with the great God of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm" title="It is he that sits on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:">Isaiah 40:22</a>), it is justly inferred that it denotes a small devastating locust which swarms in great quantities. According to the authorities in the time of Christ, it is a species which has a tail, but no hump. It was so common that the name (<span class= "ital">chagab</span>) became a generic term for many of the locust tribe. Some kinds bearing this name were beautifully marked, and were eagerly caught by Jewish children as playthings, just as butterflies and cockchafers are sought after by children in the present day. Others again were caught in large numbers, sprinkled over with wine, and then sold. Hence the following two rules obtained during the second Temple: (1) No Israelite was allowed to buy them after the dealer had prepared them in this manner; and (2) he that vowed to abstain from flesh is not allowed to eat the flesh of fish and of (<span class= "ital">chagabim</span>) locusts. Because the edible kinds of locusts are passed over in the parallel dietary laws in Deuteronomy, some have concluded that the eating of these insects was prohibited at the more advanced time when Deuteronomy was written. The fact, however, that John the Baptist ate locusts, and that a benediction was ordered during the second Temple to be recited at eating them, plainly shows the futility of the assertion. The Lawgiver never intended to repeat in Deuteronomy every particular point of legislation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
