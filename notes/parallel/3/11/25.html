During the time of the second Temple, the administrators of the law declared that wherever the Law enjoins that <span class= "bld">a </span>man should "wash his clothes" because of the legal defilement which he contracted, it included the command of bathing the body, and that it was only omitted here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-28.htm" title="And he that bears the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean to you.">Leviticus 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-40.htm" title="And he that eats of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that bears the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:40</a> for the sake of brevity. The Samaritan text and some Hebrew manuscripts have actually the whole phrase "and wash his clothes and bathe himself in water," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-15.htm" title="And every soul that eats that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.">Leviticus 17:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-19.htm" title="And the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.">Numbers 19:19</a>. In allusion to this we are told that those who contracted pollution, and have come out of the great tribulation, "washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ought of the carcase.</span>--The uncleanness was contracted by not only carrying away the whole carcase, but by removing any portion of it. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-32.htm" title="And on whatever any of them, when they are dead, does fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.">Leviticus 11:32</a>.) The expression <span class= "ital">ought </span>is represented in the original, and is rightly printed in the ordinary type of the text in the Authorised Version of 1611. The printing it in italics is an unauthorised innovation, though it is followed in the <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary, </span>which professes to give the text of 1611.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
