The coney, which is the old English name for rabbit, is the meaning of the Hebrew expression <span class= "ital">shaphan, </span>according to the definition of those who had to explain and administer this law at the time of Christ. As these interpreters lived in Palestine, where they saw the animals in question, the objection that the rabbit is not indigenous in Palestine falls to the ground. These shrewd Administrators of the law must also have noticed that it was the habit of the feeble conies to seek refuge and build in the fissures of the rocks, which not unfrequently are on a level with the ground. The rabbit, moreover, well suits the hare, by which it is immediately followed. Modern expositors, however, identify it with the Syrian hyrax, or rock-badger, which is about the size of a well-grown rabbit. It resembles the guinea-pig or the Alpine marmot, has long hair of a brownish grey or brownish-yellow colour on the back, but white on the belly, a very short tail, and short round ears. The action of its jaws when it is at rest resembles that of the ruminants.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The coney</span>, Hebrew, <span class="accented">shaphan</span>; the <span class="accented">Hyrax Syriacus</span>, or <span class="accented">wabr</span>, still called in Southern Arabia <span class="accented">tsofun, a</span> little animal similar to but not identical with the rabbit. "They live in the natural caves and clefts of the rocks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-18.htm">Psalm 104:18</a>), are very gregarious, being often seen seated in troops before the openings of their caves, and extremely timid, as they are quite defenseless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-26.htm">Proverbs 30:26</a>). They are about the size of rabbits, of a brownish-gray or brownish-yellow color, but white under the belly; they have bright eyes, round ears, and no tail. The Arabs eat them, but do not place them before their guests" (Keil). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
