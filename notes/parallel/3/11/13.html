they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,">Leviticus 11:13-19</a>. It will be seen that, whilst in the case of the two preceding divisions of the animal kingdom certain signs are given by which to distinguish the clean from the unclean animals, in the division before us a list is simply given of the birds which are unclean and prohibited. This absence of all criteria is all the more remarkable, since after some of the birds mentioned it is added "after his kind," or "after her kind" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/11-14.htm" title="And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;">Leviticus 11:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-19.htm" title="And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.">Leviticus 11:19</a>), thus showing that kindred species were included in the prohibition, and that it was left to those who had to administer this law, to lay down some general signs by which the proscribed species are to be known. Hence the following rules obtained during the second Temple. Those birds are unclean (1) which snatch their food in the air, and devour it without first dropping it on the ground; (2) which strike with their talons and press down with their foot the prey to the ground, and then tear off pieces with their beak for consumption; (3) which "divide their feet" when standing on an extended rope or branch, placing two toes on the one side and two on the other, and not three in front and one behind; and (4) whose eggs are equally narrow or equally round at both ends, and have the white in the middle and the yolk around it.<p><span class= "bld">The eagle.</span>--As the king of the birds, the eagle stands first in the list. It denotes here all the species of the eagle proper. Arabian writers, scientific travellers, and the most distinguished naturalists, concur in their testimony that the eagle eats carrion when it is still fresh, thus harmonizing with the description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-10.htm" title="Can you bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after you?">Job 39:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm" title="The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.">Proverbs 30:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-28.htm" title="For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.">Matthew 24:28</a>, &c. The assertion, therefore, that the bird here meant is the Egyptian vulture, because the eagle disdains dead bodies and feeds only on what it kills itself, is erroneous. Besides the kindred dialects, all the ancient versions and the best Hebrew scholars place it beyond a doubt that <span class= "ital">Nesher </span>here denotes eagle. Afterwards, however, the carrion-kite and the golden vulture were also reckoned among the different species of eagles. Hence the allusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm" title="Make you bald, and poll you for your delicate children; enlarge your baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from you.">Micah 1:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The ossifrage.</span>--That is, the bone-breaker, or simply <span class= "ital">the breaker, </span>is the literal translation of the expression here used in the original, which only occurs again in the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-12.htm" title="But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,">Deuteronomy 14:12</a>. It is most probably the bearded griffin or <span class= "ital">lammergeier, </span>which unites in itself the eagle and the vulture, and is therefore aptly called <span class= "ital">gypaetus </span>or vulture-eagle, and appropriately stands in the list here between the eagle and the vulture. The fitness of its name may be seen from its habits. It takes the bones of animals, which other birds of prey have denuded of the flesh, up into the air and then lets them fall upon a well-selected projecting rock. and thus literally breaks them in order to get at their marrow, or to render the fragments of the bones more digestible.<p><span class= "bld">And the ospray, </span>or sea-eagle. It is about the size of the golden-eagle, and preys principally upon fish, but also occasionally on birds and other animals, and when its extreme voracity is not satisfied, will devour the most putrid carrion. Hence its place in the catalogue of unclean birds. The word only occurs again in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-12.htm" title="But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,">Deuteronomy 14:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-19.</span> - The unclean birds are those which are gross feeders, devourers of flesh or offal, and therefore offensive to the taste, beginning with the eagle and vulture tribe. It is probable that the words translated owl (verse 16), <span class="cmt_word">night hawk</span> (verse 16), <span class="cmt_word">cuckow</span> (verse 16) should be rendered, <span class="accented">ostrich, owl, gull</span>, and perhaps for <span class="cmt_word">swan</span> (verse 18), <span class="cmt_word">heron</span> (verse 19), <span class="cmt_word">lapwing</span> (verse 19), should be substituted <span class="accented">ibis, great plover, hoopoe.</span> In the case of the bat, we have again phenomenal language used. Being generally regarded as a bird, it is classed with birds. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
