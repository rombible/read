It preys upon putrid corpses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm" title="The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.">Proverbs 30:17</a>), and is especially eager to pick out the eyes of the dead, and sometimes even attacks the eyes of the living. So great is its gluttony that it fills the air with its wild shrieks when searching for food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-9.htm" title="He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.">Psalm 147:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-41.htm" title="Who provides for the raven his food? when his young ones cry to God, they wander for lack of meat.">Job 38:41</a>). Its rapacity makes the raven expel its own offspring from their nest and from the surrounding places as soon as they are able to fly, and before they are quite able to procure their own food. Indeed, the ancients believed that it forsook its young immediately after they were hatched. It was in consequence of their excessive greed and known aversion to part with anything, even for their own offspring, that the ravens were chosen to carry food to the prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-4.htm" title="And it shall be, that you shall drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.">1Kings 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-6.htm" title="And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.">1Kings 17:6</a>), thus to make the miracle all the more striking. The phrase, "every raven after his kind," clearly shows that the whole genus of ravens is intended, with all the raven-like birds, such as the rook, the crow, the jackdaw, the jay, &c, which abound in Syria and Palestine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
