The eight animals here adduced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/11-29.htm" title="These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,">Leviticus 11:29-30</a>) are therefore a continuation of the things that go on their belly, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/11-20.htm" title="All fowls that creep, going on all four, shall be an abomination to you.">Leviticus 11:20-23</a>. They only differ in this respect, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/11-20.htm" title="All fowls that creep, going on all four, shall be an abomination to you.">Leviticus 11:20-23</a> the creeping things have also wings, whilst those described here are creeping things without wings. In a stricter sense, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-29.htm" title="These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,">Leviticus 11:29</a>, &c, is a resumption of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-20.htm" title="All fowls that creep, going on all four, shall be an abomination to you.">Leviticus 11:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The weasel.</span>--Though the Hebrew name (<span class= "ital">choled</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which literally denotes "the gliding" or "slipping in" animal, does not occur again in the Bible, yet the ancient versions and the description given of it by the administrators of the law in the time of Christ place it beyond a doubt that it is meant for weasel. According to these authorities the animal in question lodges in the holes of walls and in ditches, is inordinately voracious, kills other animals of prey much bigger than itself, and carries them off in its mouth. It is especially obnoxious to poultry, for which reason the ventilating holes in hen roosts are made so small that it should not be able to get through them, it has pointed and crooked teeth, with which it pierces through the skull and brain of the hens; it attacks sleeping children and human corpses, and laps water from a vessel. It delights in pilfering bright objects, which it hides in holes. It will be seen that this description given by the administrators of the law during the second Temple, of the animal meant by <span class= "ital">choled </span>can only apply to the weasel, and not to the mole. This is fully supported by the ancient versions, though the word denotes "mole" in Arabic, and is sometimes also used in this sense in the Talmud.<p><span class= "bld">And the mouse.</span>--Besides this passage, this word (<span class= "ital">achbar</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which is taken to denote "the field," or 'corn-destroyer," also occurs four times in Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/6-4.htm" title="Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.">1Samuel 6:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-11.htm" title="And they laid the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.">1Samuel 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-18.htm" title="And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even to the great stone of Abel, where on they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.">1Samuel 6:18</a>), and once in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-17.htm" title="They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the middle, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, said the LORD.">Isaiah 66:17</a>) and is uniformly translated "mouse." That this is the true rendering is fully confirmed by the ancient versions and the administrators of the law during the second Temple. Their insatiable voracity and great fecundity make mice destroy the entire produce of a harvest in an incredibly short time. For this reason they became the symbol of destruction in the Egyptian hieroglyphics, and obtained the appellation, "the scourge of the field" in the Bible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-5.htm" title="Why you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.">1Samuel 6:5</a>). So great was the injury which they inflicted upon the fields in Palestine, that during the second Temple the administrators of the law permitted the Jews to destroy them by any means, even on the middle days of the two great pilgrimage festivals, the Feasts of Passover and of Tabernacles. The mischievous instinct which they have of gnawing at things which they cannot eat, and of penetrating into the sanctuary, and destroying the sacred food and scriptures, made mice peculiarly repulsive to the Jews, who gave them the appellation of "wicked mice," a name with which they brand any malicious and wicked person to this day.<p><span class= "bld">And the tortoise.</span>--This creature (<span class= "ital">tzab</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which literally denotes "the swollen," "the inflated" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-27.htm" title="And when he has made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.">Numbers 5:27</a>), occurs nowhere else in the Bible. That it is not the tortoise is perfectly certain, since this animal, according to the highest legal authority, was not unclean. Thus Maimonides tells us "only those animals mentioned in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/11-29.htm" title="These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,">Leviticus 11:29-30</a>) are defiling, but not the serpent, the frog, and the tortoise." It is certain that the authorities in the time of Christ took it to denote the toad. This is evident from the discussion as to the condition of the man who has touched an animal, and cannot decide whether it is a frog, which is not defiling, or a <span class= "ital">tzab, </span>which is defiling. As it is the toad, and not the tortoise or lizard, which has such a misleading resemblance to the frog, there can hardly be any doubt that the administrators of the law understood the reptile here to denote the toad. This agrees with the meaning of the name, which, as we have seen, denotes the "swollen one," and which is one of the peculiar characteristics distinguishing it from the frog, by its having a thick, squat, and more swollen body. The reason why the toad and not the frog is put into the defiling list of reptiles is probably owing to the fact that its shorter legs impart to it more the appearance of a creeping thing, and that it was believed that the limpid fluid which this reptile suddenly discharges when touched is poisonous. Some ancient versions, however, translate it "the land crocodile."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The creeping things that creep upon the earth.</span> This class contains things that go on their belly, but have not wings, like the previous class of creeping things (verses 20-23). By the words translated tortoise, ferret, chameleon, lizard, snail, mole, different varieties of the lizard are probably meant. The mouse is joined by Isaiah with "eating swine's flesh and the abomination" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
