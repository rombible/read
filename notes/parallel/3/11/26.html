According to the Pharisees, or the National Church in the time of Christ, the phrase "that toucheth <span class= "ital">them</span>" in the last part of this verse refers to "the carcases" of the unclean animals spoken of in the preceding verse. It was only when an unclean animal was dead, whether death was owing to natural causes, design, or accident, that contact with its body defiled (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-8.htm" title="Of their flesh shall you not eat, and their carcass shall you not touch; they are unclean to you.">Leviticus 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-31.htm" title="These are unclean to you among all that creep: whoever does touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:31</a>); but when alive, unclean animals were freely used. Hence camels, asses, horses, &c, were employed in daily life, though unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-40.htm" title="Moreover they that were near them, even to Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.">1Chronicles 12:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-15.htm" title="And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.">Zechariah 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-2.htm" title="Saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.">Matthew 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-15.htm" title="The Lord then answered him, and said, You hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?">Luke 13:15</a>, &c.). The Authorised Version rightly expresses this sense by inserting "the carcases" in italics at the beginning of the verse, thus showing that "them" in the latter part of the verse refers to the bodies of unclean animals when dead. Indeed some MSS. have actually "that toucheth their carcases," instead of "that toucheth them." The Sadducees, however, took the expression "them" to refer to the living unclean animals, and hence maintained that touching the body of any animal described in this dietary list as unclean defiled. The difference which this interpretation of the text produced in the domestic life and social intercourse of the Jews can hardly be described, since, according to the doctrine of the Sadducees, it was exceedingly difficult to remain undefiled as soon as one of them stepped outside their dwellings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br />]</body></html>
