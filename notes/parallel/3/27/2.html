According to the interpretation of this phrase which obtained during the second Temple it denotes <span class= "ital">shall pronounce a vow. </span>Hence the ancient Chaldee Versions render it, "shall distinctly pronounce a vow." Accordingly, no vow mentally made or conceived was deemed binding. It had to be distinctly pronounced in words. The form of the vow is nowhere given in the Bible. Like many other points of detail, the wording of it was left to the administrators of the law. They divided vows into two classes: (1) Positive vows, by which a man bound himself to consecrate for religious purposes his own person, those members of his family over whom he had control, or any portion of his property, and for this kind of vow the formula was "Behold I consecrate this to the Lord"; and (2) Negative vows, by which he promised to abstain from enjoying a certain thing, for which the formula was, "Such and such a thing be unlawful to me for so many days, weeks, or for ever."<p><span class= "bld">The persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">souls to the Lord according to thy estimation</span>., that is, the vow consists of consecrating persons to the Lord with the intention of redeeming by money the persons thus consecrated, according to the valuation put upon them by Moses. This part of the verse explains the nature of the vow, and takes it for granted that by consecrating a human being to God by a vow is meant to substitute the money value for him. By the suffix, "<span class= "ital">thy </span>estimation," Moses is meant, to whom these regulations are here Divinely communicated, and upon whom it devolved in the first instance to carry out the law. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm" title="If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with your estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.">Leviticus 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-18.htm" title="And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew it not, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 5:18</a>.)

Some persons who thus dedicated themselves might be employed as assistants; in general they were to be redeemed for a value. It is good to be zealously affected and liberally disposed for the Lord's service; but the matter should be well weighed, and prudence should direct as to what we do; else rash vows and hesitation in doing them will dishonour God, and trouble our own minds.</body></html>
