Like the cattle and the patrimonial estates, when once devoted to God by a vow of banning, the man thus banned by a vow comes irretrievably under the class of "most holy unto the Lord," or one irrevocably withdrawn from the power of man.<p><span class= "bld">But shall surely be put to death.</span>--Not as a sacrifice to God, but, on the contrary, to be removed out of His sight. This is the apparent import of the passage, and seems to be confirmed by the melancholy narrative of Jephtha and his daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm" title="And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,">Judges 11:30</a>). This seems to have been the interpretation put on the law in question during the second Temple, since it is embodied in the Chaldee Versions, which render the verse as follows: "Every vow that shall be vowed of man, shall not be redeemed with money, but with burnt offerings and with hallowed victims, and with supplications for mercy before the Lord, because such are to be put to death." It is, however, supposed that this Awful vow of banning could only be exercised on notorious malefactors and idolaters as dangerous to the faith of the Israelites, that it could not be made by any private individual on his own responsibility, and that when such cases occurred the community or the Sanhedrin carried out the ban as an act of judicial necessity, thus showing it to be "most holy unto the Lord." Accordingly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28-29</a> treat of two different cases. The former regulates objects "banned unto the Lord," which differs from the vow of dedication discussed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.">Leviticus 27:2-8</a> only in so far that it is unredeemable, whilst <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-29.htm" title="None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 27:29</a> regulates the banning enacted by the law itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-19.htm" title="Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 22:19</a>), or pronounced by the court of justice on a man who is irretrievably to be put to death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:26-33 Things or persons devoted, are distinguished from things or persons that were only sanctified. Devoted things were most holy to the Lord, and could neither be taken back nor applied to other purposes. Whatever productions they had the benefit, God must be honoured with the tenth of, if it could be applied. Thus they acknowledge God to be the Owner of their land, the Giver of its fruits, and themselves to be his tenants, and dependants upon him. Thus they gave him thanks for the plenty they enjoyed, and besought his favour in the continuance of it. We are taught to honour the Lord with our substance.</body></html>
