Abraham gave tithes to Melchizedek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-4.htm">Hebrews 7:4</a>). Jacob vowed the tenth to the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>), whence we see that the practice of the payment of tithes was not of Mosaic institution, but immemorial. The duty was, however, commanded afresh for the Israelites. "I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>), and of this tithe they were to pay a tenth to the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26</a>). Being already the Lord's, the tithe of the corn and fruits could not be vowed to the Lord, but it could be redeemed, or commuted, by the owner paying one-fifth more than the price at which it was valued. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:26-33 Things or persons devoted, are distinguished from things or persons that were only sanctified. Devoted things were most holy to the Lord, and could neither be taken back nor applied to other purposes. Whatever productions they had the benefit, God must be honoured with the tenth of, if it could be applied. Thus they acknowledge God to be the Owner of their land, the Giver of its fruits, and themselves to be his tenants, and dependants upon him. Thus they gave him thanks for the plenty they enjoyed, and besought his favour in the continuance of it. We are taught to honour the Lord with our substance.</body></html>
