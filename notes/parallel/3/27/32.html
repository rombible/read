The manner in which this was done is described by the Jewish canonists as follows: "The owner is to gather all his lambs or all his calves into the fold and make a little door to it, so that two should not be able to go out at once. He is to place their dams without. As they bleat the lambs hear their voice and go out of the fold to meet them, as it is said, 'whatsoever passeth under the rod' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-32.htm" title="And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:32</a>), since it must pass of itself, and not be brought out by his hand. And as they come out of the fold one after another he counts them with the rod, one, two, three, etc., and the tenth which comes out, whether it be male or female, whether it be perfect or blemished, he marks it with a red mark, and says, 'This is the tithe.'" It is to this custom that the prophet alludes when he says, "I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-37.htm" title="And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:">Ezekiel 20:37</a>), that is, shall once more claim you, being marked as belonging to the Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - The tithe of the cattle could neither be vowed nor redeemed. As the young oxen and sheep passed under the rod by which they were counted by the herdsman, the tenth animal was touched (the rod, according to tradition, having been dipped in red paint), and handed over to the Levites. There was to be no change made in the animals, nor was commutation allowed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:26-33 Things or persons devoted, are distinguished from things or persons that were only sanctified. Devoted things were most holy to the Lord, and could neither be taken back nor applied to other purposes. Whatever productions they had the benefit, God must be honoured with the tenth of, if it could be applied. Thus they acknowledge God to be the Owner of their land, the Giver of its fruits, and themselves to be his tenants, and dependants upon him. Thus they gave him thanks for the plenty they enjoyed, and besought his favour in the continuance of it. We are taught to honour the Lord with our substance.</body></html>
