He was perfectly at liberty to ban not only his cattle and his otherwise inalienable inherited land, but also those human beings over whom he had control--his children and slaves.<p><span class= "bld">Every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.</span>--Being most holy, any thing or person thus devoted to the Lord could neither be sold by the officials of the sanctuary nor be redeemed by the vower who had in this manner banned the objects of his vow. All gifts devoted under the ban became the property of the priests. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-17.htm" title="If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it shall stand.">Leviticus 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-14.htm" title="Every thing devoted in Israel shall be yours.">Numbers 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm" title="They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.">Ezekiel 44:29</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - Whatever is already <span class="accented">cherem</span> (a word here first used as a term well understood), that is, <span class="accented">devoted</span> to God, whether devoted for the purpose of destruction or of entire surrender to him, may be neither redeemed nor sold. Whether it be of man, like the Canaanites at Hormah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2</a>), or of beast, as the sheep and oxen of the Amalekites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-21.htm">1 Samuel 15:21</a>), or of the field, as referred to in verse 21, or of other inanimate objects, as the cities of Hormah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2</a>), it is either to be put to death or given up without reserve or commutation to God's ministers. In the case of men they must be put to death. "This provision would have applied only to the devoting of those who were already manifestly under the ban of Jehovah those guilty of such outrageous and flagrant violation of the fundamental law of the covenant that they manifestly came under the penalty of death. Such persons, instead of being tried and condemned, might be at once devoted and put to death" (Gardiner). "To this it may be added that the devotion by ban (<span class="accented">cherem</span>) of any object or person was not to be done by private persons, at their own will, but was performed by the civil magistrates, under known conditions and laws; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the cities of idolaters, such as Jericho, were so devoted, and the inhabitants, by the command of God himself, who made his people to be the executioners of his judgments against inveterate idolatry (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>)" (Wordsworth). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:26-33 Things or persons devoted, are distinguished from things or persons that were only sanctified. Devoted things were most holy to the Lord, and could neither be taken back nor applied to other purposes. Whatever productions they had the benefit, God must be honoured with the tenth of, if it could be applied. Thus they acknowledge God to be the Owner of their land, the Giver of its fruits, and themselves to be his tenants, and dependants upon him. Thus they gave him thanks for the plenty they enjoyed, and besought his favour in the continuance of it. We are taught to honour the Lord with our substance.</body></html>
