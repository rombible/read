The regulations are supplementary to those given before, and embody a separate enactment.<p><span class= "bld">When ye have gathered in the fruit of the land.</span>--That is, those productions which ripen in the autumnal season, as wheat, barley, oil, wine, &c.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord.</span>--The Israelites are then to keep a festival in which they are to acknowledge the bounties of the Lord and express their gratitude to the Giver of all good things. For this reason this festival is also called "the Feast of Ingathering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm" title="And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm" title="And you shall observe the feast of weeks, of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.">Exodus 34:22</a>).<p><span class= "bld">On the first day shall be a sabbath.</span>--Both on the first and last days of this festival there is to be abstention from all servile work. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-35.htm" title="On the first day shall be an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:35-36</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 39-44.</span> - A further instruction respecting the Feast of Tabernacles is appended. <span class="cmt_word">When ye have gathered in the fruit of the land,</span> not necessarily at the completion of the ingathering, but at the time at which the festival is held, <span class="cmt_word">ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees.</span> The word in the Hebrew, in its literal acceptation, means fruits of goodly trees, and hence in later times a misunderstanding arose (see 2 Macc. 10:6, 7), which led to the graceful practice of carrying in the left hand citrons (the fruit of goodly trees), and in the right hand myrtles, palms, and willows. It appears, however, that the word signifies in this place rather products than fruits, namely, leaves and branches. The command, therefore, would be, <span class="cmt_word">ye shall take you...</span> <span class="accented">products <span class="cmt_word"></span>of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brooks.</span> Originally, the purpose of these boughs was to make booths, as is shown by <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15, 16</a>, "Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written. So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths." <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.</span> Accordingly we find when the feast was observed by Ezra, after the long interval from the days of Joshua, "there was very great gladness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>). The reason of the injunction to dwell in booths is <span class="cmt_word">that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt;</span> that is, on the first night after they had been delivered from Egypt, and encamped at Succoth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:33-44 In the feast of Tabernacles there was a remembrance of their dwelling in tents, or booths, in the wilderness, as well as their fathers dwelling in tents in Canaan; to remind them of their origin and their deliverance. Christ's tabernacling on earth in human nature, might also be prefigured. And it represents the believer's life on earth: a stranger and pilgrim here below, his home and heart are above with his Saviour. They would the more value the comforts and conveniences of their own houses, when they had been seven days dwelling in the booths. It is good for those who have ease and plenty, sometimes to learn what it is to endure hardness. The joy of harvest ought to be improved for the furtherance of our joy in God. The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; therefore whatever we have the comfort of, he must have the glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected. God appointed these feasts, Beside the sabbaths and your free-will offerings. Calls to extraordinary services will not excuse from constant and stated ones.</body></html>
