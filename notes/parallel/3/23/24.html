As the first of <span class= "ital">Ethanim, </span>as the month is called in the Bible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm" title="And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.">1Kings 8:2</a>), or <span class= "ital">Tishri, </span>as the Jews call it, in which this festival occurs, is the commencement of the civil new year, this festival was called "the Festival of New Year" ever since the time of the second Temple, and has been regarded as preparatory to the great day of Atonement, which is ten days later. The blowing of trumpets, therefore, which was the distinguishing feature of this festival, was designed to summon the Israelites to enter upon the work of sanctification, which will be accounted to them as a merit in the sight of God, and for which they are promised to be especially remembered before the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/10-9.htm" title="And if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you, then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and you shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.">Numbers 10:9-10</a>). Hence its name, <span class= "ital">Remembrance blowing--</span>the blowing of trumpets, which will make them to be remembered before the Lord. The synagogue, however, takes the name more in the sense of "reminding" God of the merits of the patriarchs and his covenant with them, and for this reason has appointed <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/21-1.htm" title="And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.">Genesis 21:1-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/22-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.">Genesis 22:1-24</a>, recording the birth and sacrifice of Isaac, as the lesson for this festival.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:23-32 the blowing of trumpets represented the preaching of the gospel, by which men are called to repent of sin, and to accept the salvation of Christ, which was signified by the day of atonement. Also it invited to rejoice in God, and become strangers and pilgrims on earth, which was denoted by the feast of Tabernacles, observed in the same month. At the beginning of the year, they were called by this sound of trumpet to shake off spiritual drowsiness, to search and try their ways, and to amend them. The day of atonement was the ninth day after this; thus they were awakened to prepare for that day, by sincere and serious repentance, that it might indeed be to them a day of atonement. The humbling of our souls for sin, and the making our peace with God, is work that requires the whole man, and the closest application of mind. On that day God spake peace to his people, and to his saints; therefore they must lay aside all their wordly business, that they might the more clearly hear that voice of joy and gladness.</body></html>
