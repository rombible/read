seven sabbaths shall be complete:">Leviticus 23:15-22</a>), (3) New Year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-23.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 23:23-25</a>), (4) Day of Atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-26.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 23:26-32</a>), (5) Tabernacles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-33.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 23:33-36</a> a), and (6) the concluding festival (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm" title="Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation to you;

Thus the list of these festivals concludes with the formula by which they were introduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-4.htm" title="These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their seasons.">Leviticus 23:4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To offer an offering.</span>--On these festivals sacrifices are to be offered as prescribed in Numbers 28, 29.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37, 38.</span> - These verses form the conclusion of the immediate subject. The feasts have been enumerated in which holy convocations are to be held and public sacrifices offered; these sacrifices, it is explained, not including those of the sabbath or of individual offerers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:33-44 In the feast of Tabernacles there was a remembrance of their dwelling in tents, or booths, in the wilderness, as well as their fathers dwelling in tents in Canaan; to remind them of their origin and their deliverance. Christ's tabernacling on earth in human nature, might also be prefigured. And it represents the believer's life on earth: a stranger and pilgrim here below, his home and heart are above with his Saviour. They would the more value the comforts and conveniences of their own houses, when they had been seven days dwelling in the booths. It is good for those who have ease and plenty, sometimes to learn what it is to endure hardness. The joy of harvest ought to be improved for the furtherance of our joy in God. The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; therefore whatever we have the comfort of, he must have the glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected. God appointed these feasts, Beside the sabbaths and your free-will offerings. Calls to extraordinary services will not excuse from constant and stated ones.</body></html>
