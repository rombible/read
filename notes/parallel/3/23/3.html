The hour at which it began and ended was announced by three blasts of the trumpets.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall do no work therein.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">ye shall do no manner of work, </span>as the Authorised version renders this phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-31.htm" title="You shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:31</a> of this very chapter.

Whilst on all other festivals servile work only was forbidden (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-7.htm" title="In the first day you shall have an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-21.htm" title="And you shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation to you: you shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.">Leviticus 23:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-25.htm" title="You shall do no servile work therein: but you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-35.htm" title="On the first day shall be an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:35-36</a>), and work connected with the preparation of the necessary food was permitted (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-16.htm" title="And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.">Exodus 12:16</a>), the sabbath and the day of atonement were the only days on which the Israelites were prohibited to engage in any work whatsoever. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-28.htm" title="And you shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.">Leviticus 23:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-30.htm" title="And whatever soul it be that does any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.">Leviticus 23:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm" title="And this shall be a statute for ever to you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojournes among you:">Leviticus 16:29</a>.) Though manual labour on the sabbath was punished with death by lapidation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/31-14.htm" title="You shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you: every one that defiles it shall surely be put to death: for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.">Exodus 31:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm" title="Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever does work therein shall be put to death.">Exodus 35:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/15-35.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.">Numbers 15:35-36</a>), and though the authorities during the second Temple multiplied and registered most minutely the things which constitute labour, yet these administrators of the Law have enacted that in cases of illness and of any danger work is permitted. They laid down the principle that "the sabbath is delivered into your hand, but not you into the hand of the sabbath." Similar is the declaration of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-8.htm" title="For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.">Matthew 12:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/2-27.htm" title="And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:">Mark 2:27-28</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seventh day is the sabbath of rest.</span> This is a very strong expression, literally, <span class="accented">the sabbath of sabbatism</span>, which doubles the force of the single word. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall do no work</span> therein. The sabbath and the Day of Atonement were the only days in which no work might be done, whereas on the other festivals it was only no servile work that might be done. It is not to be observed solely where the tabernacle is pitched or the temple is built, but in every town and village of Canaan - <span class="cmt_word">in all your dwellings</span>. In the sanctuary itself the peculiar characteristics of the sabbath were a holy convocation, the renewal of the shewbread, and the burnt offering of two lambs with their meat and drink offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9, 10</a>); elsewhere it was observed only by the holy convocation and rest from all labour. It commenced at sunset on Friday evening, and continued till sunset on Saturday evening. In later days the hour at which it began was announced by three blasts of the priests' trumpets, immediately after which a new course of priests entered on their ministry. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-3 In this chapter we have the institution of holy times; many of which have been mentioned before. Though the yearly feasts were made more remarkable by general attendance at the sanctuary, yet these must not be observed more than the sabbath. On that day they must withdraw from all business of the world. It is a sabbath of rest, typifying spiritual rest from sin, and rest in God. God's sabbaths are to be religiously observed in every private house, by every family apart, as well as by families together, in holy assemblies. The sabbath of the Lord in our dwellings will be their beauty, strength, and safety; it will sanctify, build up, and glorify them.</body></html>
