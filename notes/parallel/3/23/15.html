As this was the fifteenth of Nisan, the counting began from the sixteenth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-11.htm" title="And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.">Leviticus 23:11</a>), the day on which the omer of the first-fruits was presented to the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">Seven sabbaths shall be complete.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">seven weeks shall be complete. </span>That is, seven entire weeks, making forty-nine days. The expression sabbath denotes here a week, hence the parallel passage substitutes the word week, viz., "seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm" title="Seven weeks shall you number to you: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as you begin to put the sickle to the corn.">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>), The same usage is to be found in the New Testament. Thus the passage rendered in the Authorised version, "the first day of the week," is "the first day of the sabbath" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm" title="In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.">Matthew 28:1</a>); and "I fast twice in the week" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm" title="I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.">Luke 18:12</a>), is, "I fast twice in the sabbath." In accordance with the injunction here given, the Jews to the present day begin to count the forty-nine days at the conclusion of the evening service on the second day of Passover, and pronounce the following blessing every evening of the forty-nine days: "Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and hast enjoined us to count the omer. This is the first day of the omer. May it please thee, O Lord our God, and the God of our fathers, to rebuild the sanctuary speedily in our days, and give us our portion in thy Law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-21.</span> - The Feast of Pentecost lasted but one day. <span class="cmt_word">From the morrow after the sabbath</span> - that is, from the second day of Unleavened Bread - <span class="cmt_word">the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, weeks, were to be counted, making forty-nine days, and on the day following the completion of <span class="cmt_word">the seventh sabbath</span> (meaning here the seventh week), the festival was to be held, whence its later name of Pentecost, or Fiftieth-day Feast. It would have fallen about the beginning of June - a season of the year which would have made the journey to Jerusalem easy. The characteristic offering of the day was that of <span class="cmt_word">two wave loaves of two tenth deals... of fine flour... baken with leaven.</span> These loaves were regarded as the firstfruits unto the Lord of the wheat harvest, although the greater part of the crop had now been reaped and housed. They were to be leavened and <span class="cmt_word">brought out of your habitations</span>; that is, they were to consist of such bread as was ordinarily used in daily life. They were made out of ears of wheat selected and cut like the barley in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and then threshed and ground in the temple court. Each loaf contained an omer of flour, amounting to about five pints, and would therefore have weighed about five pounds. With these were offered two lambs, which were waved before the Lord by being led backwards and forwards before the tabernacle or the temple, and then the loaves were waved also, but they were not placed upon the altar, as they were leavened. The twentieth verse, which is somewhat obscure in the Authorized Version, should be punctuated as follows. <span class="cmt_word">And the priest shall wave them</span> (the two lambs) <span class="cmt_word">with the bread of the firstfruits</span> (the two loaves) for <span class="cmt_word">a wave offering before the Lord; with the two lambs they</span> (the loaves) <span class="cmt_word">shall be holy to the Lord for the priest.</span> The other sacrifices to be offered on this day are described in the text as <span class="cmt_word">seven lambs,... one young bullock, and two rams... for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings,... </span> and <span class="cmt_word">one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</span> In the Book of Numbers (Numbers 28:27) they are stated to be "seven lambs," "two young bullocks," "one ram," with meat and drink offerings, and "one kid of the goats." Seeing that in Leviticus <span class="accented">one young bullock and two rams</span> are commanded, and in Numbers "two young bullocks and one ram," it is reasonable to suppose that a copyist's error has found its way into one or the other text. The feast was to be kept as a day of holy convocation, and no servile work was to be done upon it. The number of sacrifices offered by individuals who had come to Jerusalem caused the festivity to be in practice continued for several days subsequent to the festival itself. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:15-22 The feast of Weeks was held in remembrance of the giving of the law, fifty days after the departure from Egypt; and looked forward to the outpouring of the Holy Ghost, fifty days after Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us. On that day the apostles presented the first-fruits of the Christian church to God. To the institution of the feast of Pentecost, is added a repetition of that law, by which they were required to leave the gleanings of their fields. Those who are truly sensible of the mercy they received from God, will show mercy to the poor without grudging.</body></html>
