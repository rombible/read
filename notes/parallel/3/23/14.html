By bread is meant the unleavened bread which they were now enjoined to eat. The unleavened bread for the first and the second days of Passover was prepared from the last year's harvest, but the bread for the following days could only be made from the new harvest after the normal dedication of it to the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">Parched corn.--</span>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm" title="And if you offer a meat offering of your first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the meat offering of your first fruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.">Leviticus 2:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Green ears.--</span>The expression <span class= "ital">carmel, </span>which the Authorised version renders "full ears" in Lev. 214, the authorities during the second Temple took to denote the five kinds of the new grain, viz., wheat, rye, oats, and two kinds of barley, which were forbidden to be used in any form whatsoever prior to this public dedication of the harvest to the Lord. The same custom of dedicating the first-fruits of the harvest to the divine beings also obtained amongst the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and other nations of antiquity.<p><span class= "bld">A statute for ever . . . --</span>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-17.htm" title="It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that you eat neither fat nor blood.">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-23.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, You shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.">Leviticus 7:23-25</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:4-14 The feast of the Passover was to continue seven days; not idle days, spent in sport, as many that are called Christians spend their holy-days. Offerings were made to the Lord at his altar; and the people were taught to employ their time in prayer, and praise, and godly meditation. The sheaf of first-fruits was typical of the Lord Jesus, who is risen from the dead as the First-fruits of them that slept. Our Lord Jesus rose from the dead on the very day that the first-fruits were offered. We are taught by this law to honour the Lord with our substance, and with the first-fruits of all our increase, Pr 3:9. They were not to eat of their new corn, till God's part was offered to him out of it; and we must always begin with God: begin every day with him, begin every meal with him, begin every affair and business with him; seek first the kingdom of God.</body></html>
