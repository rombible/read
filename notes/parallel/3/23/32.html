It is most unaccountable why the translators varied this important formula, when it is exactly the same in the original in both passages. For the import of this phrase see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-31.htm" title="It shall be a sabbath of rest to you, and you shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.">Leviticus 16:31</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And ye shall afflict your souls.</span>--Having set forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-30.htm" title="And whatever soul it be that does any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.">Leviticus 23:30-31</a>, and in the first clause of this verse, the duty of abstaining from all work, and of celebrating this day as a day of solemn rest, the law giver repeats the second feature of the day, which is of equal importance, viz., the fasting, lest some should think that doing the one and leaving the other undone would pass as having kept this law.<p><span class= "bld">In the ninth day of the month at even.</span>--In accordance with the ancient mode of counting the day, the tenth of the month began with the evening of the ninth. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm" title="And this shall be a statute for ever to you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojournes among you:">Leviticus 16:29</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Celebrate your sabbath.</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath to the LORD.">Leviticus 25:2</a>, where this phrase occurs again, the Authorised version inconsistently renders it k<span class= "ital">eep . </span>. . <span class= "ital">sabbath. </span>In both instances, however, the margin has, "Heb., rest." This alternative rendering of part of the phrase has no meaning. To convey to the English reader an idea of the Hebrew idiom here used, which was the intention of the translators, the whole phrase should have been translated, which is, <span class= "ital">rest the day of rest, </span>that is, to "keep rest," to "keep the day of rest." Just as to "fast a fast" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-16.htm" title="David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.">2Samuel 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm" title="Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did you at all fast to me, even to me?">Zechariah 7:5</a>) denotes "to keep a fast." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-16.htm" title="David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.">2Samuel 12:16</a> the margin has consistently reproduced the Hebraism by remarking "Heb., fasted a fast."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:23-32 the blowing of trumpets represented the preaching of the gospel, by which men are called to repent of sin, and to accept the salvation of Christ, which was signified by the day of atonement. Also it invited to rejoice in God, and become strangers and pilgrims on earth, which was denoted by the feast of Tabernacles, observed in the same month. At the beginning of the year, they were called by this sound of trumpet to shake off spiritual drowsiness, to search and try their ways, and to amend them. The day of atonement was the ninth day after this; thus they were awakened to prepare for that day, by sincere and serious repentance, that it might indeed be to them a day of atonement. The humbling of our souls for sin, and the making our peace with God, is work that requires the whole man, and the closest application of mind. On that day God spake peace to his people, and to his saints; therefore they must lay aside all their wordly business, that they might the more clearly hear that voice of joy and gladness.</body></html>
