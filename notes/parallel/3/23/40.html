They have been most minutely defined during the second Temple.<p><span class= "bld">Boughs of goodly trees.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the fruit of goodly trees, </span>as the margin rightly renders it. As this phrase is too indefinite, and may simply denote the fruit of any choice fruit-tree, there can hardly be any doubt that in this instance, as in many other cases, the lawgiver left it to the administrators of the Law to define its precise kind. Basing it therefore upon one of the significations of the term here translated "goodly," which is <span class= "ital">to dwell, to rest, </span>the authorities during the second Temple decreed that it means the fruit winch permanently rests upon the tree--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the citron, the paradise-apple. If it came from an uncircumcised tree (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm" title="And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.">Leviticus 19:23</a>), from an unclean heave-offering (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/18-11.htm" title="And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.">Numbers 18:11-12</a>), or exhibited the slightest defect, it was ritually illegal.<p><span class= "bld">Branches of palm trees.</span>--During the second Temple this was defined as the shoot of the palm-tree when budding, before the leaves are spread abroad, and whilst it is yet like a rod. It is technically called <span class= "ital">lulab, </span>which is the expression whereby it is rendered in the ancient Chaldee version. The <span class= "ital">lulab </span>must at least be three hands tall, and must be tied together with its own kind.<p><span class= "bld">The boughs of thick trees.</span>--This, according to the same authorities, denotes <span class= "ital">the myrtle branch, </span>whose leaves thickly cover the wood. To make it ritually legal it must have three or more shoots round the stem, and on the same level with it. If it is in any way damaged it is illegal. This accounts for the ancient Chaldee version rendering it by "myrtle branch."<p><span class= "bld">Willows of the brook.</span>--That species, the distinguishing marks of which are dark wood and long leaves with smooth margin. The palm, the myrtle, and the willow, when tied together into one bundle, constitute the Lulab. Whilst the psalms are chanted by the Levites during the sacrifices, the pilgrims, who held the Lulabs or palms, shook them thrice, viz., at the singing of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-1.htm" title="O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 118:1</a>, then again at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-25.htm" title="You shall do no servile work therein: but you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:25</a>, and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-29.htm" title="For whatever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.">Leviticus 23:29</a>. When the chant was finished, the priests in procession went round the altar once, exclaiming, "Hosanna, O Lord, give us help, O Lord! give prosperity !" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-25.htm" title="Save now, I beseech you, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech you, send now prosperity.">Psalm 118:25</a>). Whereupon the solemn benediction was pronounced by the priests, and the people dispersed amidst the repeated exclamations, "How beautiful art thou, O altar !" It is this part of the ritual which explains the welcome that the multitude gave Christ when they went to meet Him with palm-branches and shouts of hosanna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/21-8.htm" title="And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.">Matthew 21:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-15.htm" title="And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,">Matthew 21:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-12.htm" title="On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,">John 12:12-13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:33-44 In the feast of Tabernacles there was a remembrance of their dwelling in tents, or booths, in the wilderness, as well as their fathers dwelling in tents in Canaan; to remind them of their origin and their deliverance. Christ's tabernacling on earth in human nature, might also be prefigured. And it represents the believer's life on earth: a stranger and pilgrim here below, his home and heart are above with his Saviour. They would the more value the comforts and conveniences of their own houses, when they had been seven days dwelling in the booths. It is good for those who have ease and plenty, sometimes to learn what it is to endure hardness. The joy of harvest ought to be improved for the furtherance of our joy in God. The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; therefore whatever we have the comfort of, he must have the glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected. God appointed these feasts, Beside the sabbaths and your free-will offerings. Calls to extraordinary services will not excuse from constant and stated ones.</body></html>
