The eighth day is also <span class="cmt_word">a solemn assembly</span>. The meaning of the word <span class="accented">atzereth</span>, translated <span class="accented">a solemn assembly</span>, is doubtful. It occurs ten times in the Hebrew Scriptures, and appears to signify <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the last day of a feast (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>, where mention is made of "the last day, that great day of the feast"); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a solemn assembly held on the last day of a feast; whence it comes to mean <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a solemn assembly. The Jews gave the name to the Feast of Pentecost, as being the close of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. On each of the seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles was to be offered an offering made by fire unto the Lord. The sacrifices to be offered are enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-38</a>. There were to be sacrificed two rams, and fourteen iambs, and bullocks diminishing by one a day from thirteen on the first day to seven on the last. These formed the burnt sacrifices. The sin offering on each day was one kid of the goats. On the eighth day the burnt offering consisted of one bullock, one ram, seven lambs, and the sin offering, as before, of one kid of the goats. Thus there were offered in all, in the eight days, seventy-one bullocks, fifteen rams, one hundred and five lambs, and eight kids, beside meat and drink offerings. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:33-44 In the feast of Tabernacles there was a remembrance of their dwelling in tents, or booths, in the wilderness, as well as their fathers dwelling in tents in Canaan; to remind them of their origin and their deliverance. Christ's tabernacling on earth in human nature, might also be prefigured. And it represents the believer's life on earth: a stranger and pilgrim here below, his home and heart are above with his Saviour. They would the more value the comforts and conveniences of their own houses, when they had been seven days dwelling in the booths. It is good for those who have ease and plenty, sometimes to learn what it is to endure hardness. The joy of harvest ought to be improved for the furtherance of our joy in God. The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; therefore whatever we have the comfort of, he must have the glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected. God appointed these feasts, Beside the sabbaths and your free-will offerings. Calls to extraordinary services will not excuse from constant and stated ones.</body></html>
