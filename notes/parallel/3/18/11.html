their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>, Deut. 26:20), in which case the man and the maiden, though no blood relations at all, would be forbidden to each other by virtue of the damsel's mother having married the man's father. It would thus differ from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm" title="The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or daughter of your mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness you shall not uncover.">Leviticus 18:9</a>, where the maiden is a half-sister either by the same father or the same mother.<p><span class= "bld">Begotten of thy father.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the birth, </span>or <span class= "ital">offspring of thy father </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm" title="The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or daughter of your mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness you shall not uncover.">Leviticus 18:9</a>), that is, though the daughter of the stepmother, she is begotten by the same father, and hence is his half-sister on the father's side, which is exactly the same case already prohibited in the first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm" title="The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or daughter of your mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness you shall not uncover.">Leviticus 18:9</a>. Hence to avoid a senseless repetition of the same prohibition we must either regard this clause as having crept into the text from <span class= "bld">a </span>marginal gloss, or we must correct the first letter of the disjunctive particle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm" title="The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or daughter of your mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness you shall not uncover.">Leviticus 18:9</a>, which would make it "the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father and the daughter of thy mother." Accordingly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm" title="The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or daughter of your mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness you shall not uncover.">Leviticus 18:9</a> prohibits marriage with a full sister, whilst the verse before us forbids it with a half-sister. The latter is the more probable, since intermarriage between entire stepbrother and stepsister has always been, and still is, legitimate among the Jews.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Incest with a half-sister on the father's side is again forbidden. Perhaps "the prohibition refers to the son by a first marriage, whereas verse 9 treats of the son by a second marriage" (Keil). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-30 Unlawful marriages and fleshly lusts. - Here is a law against all conformity to the corrupt usages of the heathen. Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to their hearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.</body></html>
