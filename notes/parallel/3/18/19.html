The penalty for the offense within the seven days is death if committed willfully (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a>); if fallen into unknowingly, a ceremonial penalty of seven days' uncleanness is incurred (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-24.htm">Leviticus 15:24</a>).

Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace.
