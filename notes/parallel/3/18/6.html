Though primarily addressed to man, who, in these cases, takes the initiative, the punishment for violating any of these laws was visited upon both man and woman.<p><span class= "bld">Near of kin to him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the flesh of his flesh. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-26.htm" title="My flesh and my heart fails: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.">Psalm 73:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-20.htm" title="Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?">Psalm 78:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-27.htm" title="He rained flesh also on them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:">Psalm 78:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/3-2.htm" title="Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;">Micah 3:2-3</a>.) The combination of two synonymous expressions is often used to denote intensity. Thus the phrase rendered "my exceeding joy" in the Authorised Version (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-4.htm" title="Then will I go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy: yes, on the harp will I praise you, O God my God.">Psalm 43:4</a>), literally means <span class= "ital">the joy of my joy, </span>or, as the Margin has it, "the gladness of my joy." Accordingly, "the flesh of his flesh" signified "nearness of his flesh," his near kin. This technical sense is assigned to the first of these two words by itself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/18-12.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister: she is your father's near kinswoman.">Leviticus 18:12-13</a>, &c, where it is translated "near kinswoman." It expresses kinship of both consanguinity and mere affinity. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shall you take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.">Leviticus 18:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To uncover their nakedness.</span>--Upon the import of this phrase depends the interpretation of the laws laid down in this chapter and chapter 20, inasmuch as it furnishes the clue to the definition whether the interdicts refer to illicit commerce or to incestuous marriages. In the only other passage in the Pentateuch where it occurs, it does not appear to imply any unseemly intention (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-26.htm" title="Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not discovered thereon.">Exodus 20:26</a>). This is also its sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-3.htm" title="Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet you as a man.">Isaiah 47:3</a>. In the seven instances in Ezekiel, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/16-36.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness discovered through your prostitutions with your lovers, and with all the idols of your abominations, and by the blood of your children, which you did give to them;">Ezekiel 16:36-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-10.htm" title="In you have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in you have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.">Ezekiel 22:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-10.htm" title="These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment on her.">Ezekiel 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm" title="So she discovered her prostitutions, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.">Ezekiel 23:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-29.htm" title="And they shall deal with you hatefully, and shall take away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bore: and the nakedness of your prostitutions shall be discovered, both your lewdness and your prostitutions.">Ezekiel 23:29</a>), which are the only other passages in the Bible where this phrase is used, it denotes unseemly exposure, sexual intercourse, etc. Hence some high authorities maintain that in the twenty-one instances in which it is used in this part of the legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/18-6.htm" title="None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:6-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-11.htm" title="And the man that lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-17.htm" title="And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/20-20.htm" title="And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.">Leviticus 20:20-21</a>), it denotes extra-conjugal licentiousness, and is simply an explanatory addition to the phrase "approach to," with which it is combined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-6.htm" title="None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-14.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother, you shall not approach to his wife: she is your aunt.">Leviticus 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-18.htm" title="Neither shall you take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.">Leviticus 18:18</a>. From a comparison, however, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-18.htm" title="Neither shall you take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.">Leviticus 18:18</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-19.htm" title="Also you shall not approach to a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.">Leviticus 18:19</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-11.htm" title="And the man that lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:11</a>, it will be seen that it is undoubtedly used to denote sexual intercourse both within and without the pale of matrimony. As cohabitation without any religious ceremony whatever constituted and consummated marriage amongst the early Hebrews, the euphemistic phrases "to take home," "to approach to," "to know," etc., as well as the less veiled expressions, "to lie with," "to uncover her nakedness," etc., denote marriage in Hebrew, not excluding, however, the primary sense of illicit commerce or incestuous marriages. The context in which the phrase occurs must determine the sense in which it is used. The administrators of the law during the second Temple, whilst rightly interpreting it here generally to denote incestuous marriages, also apply it in some instances to fornication and adultery.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The next thirteen verses contain the law of incest, or the prohibited degrees of marriage. The positive law of marriage, as implanted in the human heart, would be simply that any man of full age might marry any woman of full age, provided that both parties were willing. But this liberty is at once controlled by a number of restrictions, the main purpose of which is to prevent incest, which, however much one nation may come to be indifferent to one form of it, and another to another, is yet abhorrent to the feelings and principles of mankind. The Hebrew restrictive law is contained in one verse. <span class="cmt_word">None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him to uncover their nakedness: I am the Lord.</span> All that follows (verses 9-18) is simply an amplification and an explanation of the words, <span class="accented">near of kin to him.</span> These words would be literally rendered, <span class="accented">flesh of his flesh</span>, or less probably (as in the margin), <span class="accented">remainder of his flesh.</span> They certainly include within the compass of their meaning those that are near by affinity, as much as those that are near by consanguinity. This is proved by the instances given below, where no difference is drawn between blood relations and relations by marriage, the latter being supposed to become the former, in consequence of the marriage that has taken place. Nearness of kin is generally counted by "degrees;" but, unfortunately, this word is itself ambiguous, for it is used in different senses by canonists and by civilians. So far as the direct line is concerned, the same method of calculation is observed by the canon and by the civil law. There is one degree from the son to the mother, two degrees to the grandmother; one degree from the father to the daughter, two degrees to the granddaughter. But this is not so with the collateral lines. A brother and sister, for example, are regarded by the canon law as in the first degree of kinship, because there is only one step to the father, in whom their blood meets; but the civil lawyers consider them as being in the second degree, because, as they calculate, there is one step from the brother to the father, and a second from the father to the sister. An aunt is, according to the canonists, in the second degree of propinquity, because there are two steps from her nephew to his grandfather, who is likewise her father, in whom their blood unites; but, according to the civilian's calculation, there are three steps, namely, from her nephew to his grandfather, two steps, and a third from that grandfather to his daughter the aunt; and therefore the aunt and nephew are in the third degree of propinquity. The case of an uncle and niece is exactly the same as that of a nephew and aunt. On the same principle, according to the canonists, first cousins are in the second degree of kinship; according to the civilians, in the fourth. Propinquity by affinity is calculated in just the same way; so that the brother's wife is in the same degree of relationship as the brother, and wife's sister as the sister by blood. In the code before us, confirmed by that in Deuteronomy, marriage is forbidden with the following blood relations: mother (verse 7), daughter (verse 17), sister (verse 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-22.htm">Deuteronomy 27:22</a>), granddaughter (verse 10), aunt (verses 12, 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-19.htm">Leviticus 20:19</a>); and with the following relations by affinity: mother-in-law (verse 17; chapter Leviticus 20:14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-23.htm">Deuteronomy 27:23</a>), daughter-in-law (verse 15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-12.htm">Leviticus 20:12</a>), brother's wife (verse 16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-21.htm">Leviticus 20:21</a>), stepmother (verse 8; chapter 20:11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>), stepdaughter and step-granddaughter (verse 17), uncle's wife, or aunt by marriage (verse 14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-20.htm">Leviticus 20:20</a>); putting aside for the present the question of who is meant by <span class="accented">a wife to her sister</span>, in verse 18. In these lists, according to the canonists' method of reckoning, the mother, the daughter, and the sister are related in the first degree of consanguinity; the wife's mother, the wife's daughter, the stepmother, the daughter-in-law, the brother's wife, are related in the first degree of affinity. The granddaughter and the aunt are in the second degree of consanguinity; the wife's granddaughter and the uncle's wife in the second degree of affinity. According to the civilians' reckoning, the following would be the degrees of propinquity: - The mother and the daughter would be in the first degree of consanguinity; the wife's mother, the wife's daughter, the stepmother, the daughter-in-law, would be in the first degree of affinity. The sister and the granddaughter would be in the second degree of consanguinity; the brother's wife and the wife's granddaughter would be in the second degree of affinity. The aunt by blood would be in the third degree of consanguinity, and the uncle's wife, or aunt by marriage, would be in the third degree of affinity. The wife's sister, with regard to whom it is questioned whether she is referred to or not in verse 18, is in the first degree of affinity (a man's wife being regarded as himself) according to the canonists' reckoning, and in the second according to the civilians'. There is no mention made in the code of the grandmother, the niece, and the cousin-german. All of these are in the second degree of consanguinity according to the canon law; and according to the civil law, the grandmother would be in the second degree, the niece in the third, and the cousin-german in the fourth. It may reasonably be supposed that by the expression, <span class="accented">None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness</span>, intercourse is forbidden between all those who are related by consanguinity or affinity in the first and second degrees according to the canonists' reckoning (except cousins-german, whose case is considered below); in the first, second, and third degrees 'according to the civilians' method of calculating; whether they are mentioned by name in the list or not. It is only by implication, not by direct injunction, that marriage even with a daughter is forbidden (verse 17). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-30 Unlawful marriages and fleshly lusts. - Here is a law against all conformity to the corrupt usages of the heathen. Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to their hearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.</body></html>
