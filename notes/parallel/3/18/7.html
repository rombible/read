The daughter must not marry or have commerce with the father, nor the son with the mother. Hence the Chaldee Version of Jonathan translates it "the woman shall not lie with her father, and the man shall not lie with his mother." Accordingly the case here contemplated is that of Lot's daughters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/19-31.htm" title="And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:">Genesis 19:31-38</a>). This passage may, however, be translated literally, <span class= "ital">the nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother shalt thou not uncover. </span>That is, they being both one flesh, the nakedness of the one is the nakedness of the other. Amongst the Persians and other eastern nations, marriage between son and mother was allowed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - Incest with a stepmother is placed next after that with a mother. On account of the unity caused by marriage ("they shall be one flesh," <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), the stepmother's nakedness <span class="cmt_word">is the father's nakedness</span>. The tie of affinity is thus declared to be similar in its effects to the tie of consanguinity. Reuben's sin, by which he forfeited his birthright, is connected with this offense, but is of a more heinous character, as his father was alive at the time of his transgression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>). It is one of the sins which Ezekiel enumerates as those which brought the judgment of God on Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a>). "That one should have his father's wife" is declared by St. Paul to be "such fornication as is not named among the Gentiles," and to call for the excommunication of the offender (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>). Adonijah's marriage with Abishag, so strongly resented by Solomon on political grounds, is not denounced as morally reprehensible, probably because Abishag was not the wife of David in such a way as to cause the marriage with his son to be abominable in the eye of the law (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-4.htm">1 Kings 1:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>). Absalom's" going in unto his father's concubines" was regarded as the final act which made reconciliation with his father impossible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-3.htm">2 Samuel 20:3</a>). The history of the Church has shown that marriage with the stepmother has had to be again and again prohibited by Council after Council (see Smith and Cheetham's 'Dictionary of Antiquities,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> 'Prohibited Degrees'). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-30 Unlawful marriages and fleshly lusts. - Here is a law against all conformity to the corrupt usages of the heathen. Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to their hearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.</body></html>
