The law which obtained in the time of Christ also defines this prohibition to extend to a mother's sister or half-sister by the same father or mother, whether born in wedlock or out of it. It is remarkable that the administrators of the law during the second Temple understood this last prohibition strictly to apply to alliances between nephews and aunts, but not <span class= "ital">vice versa </span>to marriages between nieces and uncles. They regarded intermarriage between uncle and niece as an especially meritorious act, and interpreted the promises "then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-9.htm" title="Then shall you call, and the LORD shall answer; you shall cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If you take away from the middle of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;">Isaiah 58:9</a>) to refer more particularly to the man "who loves his neighbours, befriends his relations, <span class= "ital">marries his brother's daughter, </span>and lends money to the poor in the hour of need." This is in accordance with the fact that not only do we find that Nahor married Milcah the daughter of his brother Haran(<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm" title="And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.">Genesis 11:29</a>), but that Othniel, the son of Kenaz, married his niece Achsah, being the daughter of Caleb, his father's brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-17.htm" title="And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.">Joshua 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm" title="And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.">Judges 1:13</a>). Hence among the Jews to this day intermarriages between uncles and nieces is of common occurrence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-30 Unlawful marriages and fleshly lusts. - Here is a law against all conformity to the corrupt usages of the heathen. Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to their hearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.</body></html>
