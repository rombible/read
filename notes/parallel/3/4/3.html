By this the Levitical law indicates that even the chief of the priesthood was but a frail being like the rest of the people, and was exposed to the same infirmities as the laity, thus precluding the assumption of spiritual superiority. Hence the remark of the Apostle, "the law made those high priests who had infirmity, and who needed daily to offer up sacrifices, first for their own sins, and then for the people's; but our high priest, Christ Jesus, was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27-28</a>). The phrase "the priest that is anointed" for "the high priest" is restricted to this book, where it occurs four times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-5.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-16.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-15.htm" title="And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is on the meat offering, and shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell, even the memorial of it, to the LORD.">Leviticus 6:15</a> in Heb.; 22 in the English). "The great priest," or high priest, is the appellation used in the other portions of the Pentateuch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-25.htm" title="And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, where he was fled: and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.">Numbers 35:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-28.htm" title="Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.">Numbers 35:28</a>), and in Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-6.htm" title="And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city from from where he fled.">Joshua 20:6</a>); whilst in the later books of the Old Testament this functionary is called chief priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">2Kings 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-11.htm" title="And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you.

Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.">2Chronicles 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-20.htm" title="And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from there; yes, himself hurried also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.">2Chronicles 26:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-10.htm" title="And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.">2Chronicles 31:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-5.htm" title="The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:">Ezra 7:5</a>). He is called "the anointed priest," because, like Aaron, he alone was anointed when he succeeded to the high office, whilst the ordinary priests were simply consecrated. Their anointing descended with them to all futurity by virtue of being the descendants of Aaron. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm" title="And he poured of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.">Leviticus 8:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">According to the sin of the people.</span>--That is, he having in ignorance committed the same sin as the common people, to which he is as liable as they. From the phrase "against any commandments of the Lord" in the preceding verse, as well as from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come on all the people: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.">Leviticus 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10-15</a>, it is evident that the sin of ignorance here alluded to does not refer to the inadvertent neglect of his official duty, which devolves upon the high priest as the spiritual head of the people, but to any offence whatsoever ignorantly committed. According to the marginal reading, <span class= "ital">to make the people guilty, </span>or more literally, <span class= "ital">to the guilt of the people, </span>which is equally admissible, the meaning of the passage is, that he by committing a sin causes the people to transgress, inasmuch as his example is followed by them; or that, in virtue of the intimate connection which subsisted between the representative of the nation and the people, the sin of the one was the sin of the other. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come on all the people: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.">Leviticus 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-3.htm" title="And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?">1Chronicles 21:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A young bullock.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a steer, the son of a bull. </span>The sacrificial rules which obtained at the time of Christ minutely defined the respective ages of the bullock: the steer, the son of a bull, and the calf. The bullock or ox which was brought as a sacrifice had to be three years old: "the steer the son of a bull" rendered in the passage before us, and in the Authorised Version generally, by "a young bullock" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm" title="And this is the thing that you shall do to them to hallow them, to minister to me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,">Exodus 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm" title="When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-3.htm" title="Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-8.htm" title="But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:8</a>, &c.), had to be two years old; whilst the calf had to be of the first year.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-12.</span> - The case of the high priest. He is designated the <span class="cmt_word">priest that is anointed</span>, in respect to which title, see notes on chapter 8. In case he sins in his representative character, his sin is such as <span class="accented">to bring guilt on the people</span> (this is the meaning of the words translated <span class="cmt_word">according to the sin of the people</span>), and a special sin offering must therefore be made. He is to <span class="cmt_word">take of the blood</span> of the animal sacrificed, and <span class="cmt_word">bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:... and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the vail of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense.</span> This was a more solemn method of presenting the blood to the Lord than that used in the burnt offering; the offering of the blood, which was the vehicle of life, being the chief feature in the sin offering, as the consumption of the whole animal by the altar fire was in the burnt offering. In the burnt offerings and peace offerings the blood was thrown once on the altar of burnt sacrifice (see chapter Leviticus 1:5); now it is sprinkled, in a smaller quantity each <span class="accented">time</span>, but as often as seven times (the number seven symbolically representing completeness), before the vail which shrouded the ark. <span class="accented">The altar of sweet incense</span> is the golden altar, which stood within the tabernacle, in front of the vail. Perhaps the reason why <span class="accented">the horns of the altar</span> are specially appointed to have the blood placed on them is that they were regarded as the most sacred part of the altar, because they were its highest points, in which its elevation towards heaven culminated. The remainder of the victim's blood is to be poured <span class="cmt_word">at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering</span>, in the court of the tabernacle, to sink into the ground, because no more of it was wanted for ceremonial use. The internal fat is to be burnt upon the altar of the burnt offering, but not actually upon the smoldering burnt sacrifice, as in the case of the peace offerings; the sin offering preceding the burnt offering in order of time, while the peace offering followed it. The remainder of the animal <span class="cmt_word">is to be carried without the camp... and be burnt</span>, because its flesh was at once accursed and most holy. It was accursed, as having been symbolically the vehicle of the sins laid upon it by the offerer; therefore it must not be consumed upon the altar of God, but be destroyed with fire outside the camp, typifying the removal from God's kingdom, and the final destruction of all that is sinful. But yet it was most holy, as its blood had been taken into the tabernacle, and had served as a propitiation; therefore, if it had to be burnt, it yet had to be burnt solemnly, reverently, and as a ceremonial act, in a place appointed for the purpose. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews notices that one of the points in which our Lord was the antitype of the sin offering was that he "suffered without the gate," "that he might sanctify the people with his own blood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), which was thus indicated to have been carried within the sanctuary, that is, into heaven. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 Burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and peace-offerings, had been offered before the giving of the law upon mount Sinai; and in these the patriarchs had respect to sin, to make atonement for it. But the Jews were now put into a way of making atonement for sin, more particularly by sacrifice, as a shadow of good things to come; yet the substance is Christ, and that one offering of himself, by which he put away sin. The sins for which the sin-offerings were appointed are supposed to be open acts. They are supposed to be sins of commission, things which ought not to have been done. Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment: yet what had been omitted at one time, might be done at another; but a sin committed was past recall. They are supposed to be sins committed through ignorance. The law begins with the case of the anointed priest. It is evident that God never had any infallible priest in his church upon earth, when even the high priest was liable to fall into sins of ignorance. All pretensions to act without error are sure marks of Antichrist. The beast was to be carried without the camp, and there burned to ashes. This was a sign of the duty of repentance, which is the putting away sin as a detestable thing, which our soul hates. The sin-offering is called sin. What they did to that, we must do to our sins; the body of sin must be destroyed, Ro 6:6. The apostle applies the carrying this sacrifice without the camp to Christ, Heb 13:11-13.</body></html>
