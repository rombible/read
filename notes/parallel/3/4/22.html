As the word here translated "ruler" is used for a king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-34.htm" title="However, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:">1Kings 11:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-24.htm" title="And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.">Ezekiel 34:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-2.htm" title="And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.">Ezekiel 46:2</a>), the head of a tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/1-4.htm" title="And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.">Numbers 1:4-16</a>) or of the division of a tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-18.htm" title="And you shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.">Numbers 34:18</a>), opinions differ as to the exact position of the personage here meant. Now, in comparing the phrase used with regard to the sin of ignorance in the case of the high priest, the congregation, and any one of the people, it will be seen that in all the three instances it is simply described as a sin "against any commandments of the Lord"(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:">Leviticus 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm" title="And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;">Leviticus 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-27.htm" title="And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he does somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;">Leviticus 4:27</a>), whereas in the case of the ruler, we have the exceptional phrase, "against any of the commandments of the Lord <span class= "ital">his God." </span>Hence the interpretation obtained during the second Temple that the addition of the phrase <span class= "ital">his God, </span>which shows a peculiar relationship to his God, denotes here one over whom God alone is exalted--the sovereign who is only responsible to <span class= "ital">his God.</span><p><span class= "bld">And is guilty.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and acknowledges his guilt, </span>as the Authorised Version rightly translates it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm" title="I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.">Hosea 5:15</a>. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-5.htm" title="Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.">Zechariah 11:5</a>.) This sense is not only required by the disjunctive particle or, with which the next verse begins, but by the fact that the declaration in the present rendering, "When men sin they are guilty," is a truism. The sinner is guilty whether he sins advertently or inadvertently. The case here supposed is that the prince had himself come to the knowledge that what he had done was a sin, and had acknowledged it as such.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-26.</span> - The case of a ruler or nobleman. The clause, <span class="cmt_word">Or if his sin... come to his knowledge</span>, should be rather translated, <span class="accented">If perhaps his sin come to his knowledge.</span> He is to offer <span class="cmt_word">a kid of the goats</span>, or rather a <span class="accented">he-goat.</span> The blood is not to be carried into the tabernacle, as in the two previous cases, but <span class="cmt_word">put upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering</span>, which stood outside in the court, and, as a consequence of the blood not having been taken into the tabernacle, the flesh is not to be burnt outside the camp, but to be eaten by the priests in the court of the tabernacle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:22-26 Those who have power to call others to account, are themselves accountable to the Ruler of rulers. The sin of the ruler, committed through ignorance, must come to his knowledge, either by the check of his own conscience, or by the reproof of his friends; both which even the best and greatest, not only should submit to, but be thankful for. That which I see not, teach thou me, and, Show me wherein I have erred, are prayers we should put up to God every day; that if, through ignorance, we fall into sin, we may not through ignorance abide in it.</body></html>
