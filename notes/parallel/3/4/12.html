Hence the ancient Greek Version (LXX.) and the Samaritan rightly render it by "and they shall carry," in the plural: <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the whole bullock <span class= "ital">shall be </span>carried forth. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-24.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:24</a> of this very chapter the Authorised Version properly translates the same idiom into "in the place where <span class= "ital">they </span>kill the burnt offering," though the verb, as in the verse before us, is in the singular. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm" title="When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Without the camp.</span>--During the time of the second Temple there were three places for burning: one place was in the court of the sanctuary, where they burnt the sacrifices which were unfit and rejected; the second place was in the mountain of the house called <span class= "ital">Birah, </span>where were buried those sacrifices which met with an accident after they had been carried out of the court; and the third place was without Jerusalem, called the place of ashes. It is this place to which the Apostle refers when he says, "for the bodies of those beast whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as <span class= "ital">an offering </span>for sin are burned without the camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate<span class= "ital">" </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/13-11.htm" title="For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And burn him on the wood with fire.</span>--Whilst special wood was required for the burning of those victims which were consumed in the court of the sanctuary (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm" title="And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire:">Leviticus 1:7</a>), the sacrifices which were taken outside the city could be burnt with any wood, or even straw or stubble. All that was insisted on was that it should be burned <span class= "ital">with fire, </span>as the text before us has it, but not with cinder, coals, or lime.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 Burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and peace-offerings, had been offered before the giving of the law upon mount Sinai; and in these the patriarchs had respect to sin, to make atonement for it. But the Jews were now put into a way of making atonement for sin, more particularly by sacrifice, as a shadow of good things to come; yet the substance is Christ, and that one offering of himself, by which he put away sin. The sins for which the sin-offerings were appointed are supposed to be open acts. They are supposed to be sins of commission, things which ought not to have been done. Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment: yet what had been omitted at one time, might be done at another; but a sin committed was past recall. They are supposed to be sins committed through ignorance. The law begins with the case of the anointed priest. It is evident that God never had any infallible priest in his church upon earth, when even the high priest was liable to fall into sins of ignorance. All pretensions to act without error are sure marks of Antichrist. The beast was to be carried without the camp, and there burned to ashes. This was a sign of the duty of repentance, which is the putting away sin as a detestable thing, which our soul hates. The sin-offering is called sin. What they did to that, we must do to our sins; the body of sin must be destroyed, Ro 6:6. The apostle applies the carrying this sacrifice without the camp to Christ, Heb 13:11-13.</body></html>
