In ordinary cases the offerer himself slaughtered the victim (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a>), but in the case before us Moses performed this act in accordance with the command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-11.htm" title="And you shall kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Exodus 29:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And Moses took the blood.</span>--That is, having caught the blood in the bowl, he threw it upon the four corners of the altar, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a>--not, however, on the horns of the altar of incense, or in the tabernacle, as in the case of the sin offering for the high priest and for the nation. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-7.htm" title="And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/4-16.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:16-18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And purified the altar . . . and sanctified it.</span>--Like the priest, the altar was consecrated to the service of God by the anointing oil (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm" title="And he sprinkled thereof on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.">Leviticus 8:11</a>), and hence, like the priest, the altar is also purified by the expiatory sacrifice from its defilements.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses took the blood.</span> Moses continues still to act as priest, and the new sacrifice is once offered by him. He performs the priestly act of presenting the blood; but on this occasion, which is special, the blood is not dealt with in the manner prescribed for the high priest's offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6</a>). The reason of this is that Aaron was not yet high priest, and also that the offering was made not only for Aaron, but also for his sons; and further, the blood as well as the anointing oil was required to <span class="cmt_word">purify the altar, and sanctify it</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>). Although the blood was not "brought into the tabernacle," yet the bullock was <span class="cmt_word">burnt with fire without the camp,</span> not eaten according to the rule of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26, 30</a>. This was necessary, as there were as yet no priests to eat it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-36 In these types we see our great High Priest, even Christ Jesus, solemnly appointed, anointed, and invested with his sacred office, by his own blood, and the influences of his Holy Spirit. He sanctifies the ordinances of religion, to the benefit of his people and the honour of God the Father; who for his sake accepts our worship, though it is polluted with sin. We may also rejoice, that he is a merciful and faithful High Priest, full of compassion to the feeble-minded and tempest-tossed soul. All true Christians are consecrated to be spiritual priests. We should seriously ask ourselves, whether in our daily walk we study to maintain this character? and abound in spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Christ? If so, still there is no cause for boasting. Let us not despise our fellow-sinners; but remembering what we have done, and how we are saved, let us seek and pray for their salvation.</body></html>
