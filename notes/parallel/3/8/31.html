with the exception of the fat parts and the right shoulder, which were burnt upon the altar, and the wave-breast, which was awarded to Moses as the officiating priest on the occasion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-31.htm" title="And you shall take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.">Exodus 29:31-32</a>), the flesh of the victim is to be prepared by Aaron and his sons for the sacrificial meal (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-11.htm" title="And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer to the LORD.">Leviticus 7:11</a>, &c.). From the peculiar nature of this offering, however, it is ordained that the flesh is to be boiled <span class= "ital">at the entrance of the tent of meeting, </span>not <span class= "ital">at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, </span>as the Authorised Version has it. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-31.htm" title="And you shall take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.">Exodus 29:31</a>, this is to take place "at the holy place," that is, in the court, and is to be eaten with unleavened bread, thus distinguishing it from the ordinary sacrificial meal of the peace offering.<p><span class= "bld">Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</span>--This is another distinguishing feature of the sacrifice in question. Whilst to the ordinary sacrificial feasts the offerer could invite his family and strangers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm" title="And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.">Leviticus 7:15</a>), in this no layman or non-priest could partake of the meal, because the flesh and the bread were peculiarly holy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-33.htm" title="And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.">Exodus 29:33</a>), as this sacrifice had the same atoning virtue as the burnt offering. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm" title="And he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.">Leviticus 1:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - The flesh of the peace offering is given to Aaron and his sons to eat, not in the capacity of priests (for the peace offerings were not eaten by the priests), but as the offerers of the sacrifice. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-36 In these types we see our great High Priest, even Christ Jesus, solemnly appointed, anointed, and invested with his sacred office, by his own blood, and the influences of his Holy Spirit. He sanctifies the ordinances of religion, to the benefit of his people and the honour of God the Father; who for his sake accepts our worship, though it is polluted with sin. We may also rejoice, that he is a merciful and faithful High Priest, full of compassion to the feeble-minded and tempest-tossed soul. All true Christians are consecrated to be spiritual priests. We should seriously ask ourselves, whether in our daily walk we study to maintain this character? and abound in spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Christ? If so, still there is no cause for boasting. Let us not despise our fellow-sinners; but remembering what we have done, and how we are saved, let us seek and pray for their salvation.</body></html>
