Where the phrase "to wash with water" is used without specifying any particular part or parts of the body, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-2.htm" title="And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and you shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, No; but we will abide in the street all night.">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-32.htm" title="And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.">Genesis 24:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-19.htm" title="For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:">Exodus 30:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-21.htm" title="So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.">Exodus 30:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-6.htm" title="And all the elders of that city, that are next to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>, it denotes the washing or bathing of the entire body. This was not done in the presence of the people, but in a baptistry, behind a curtain. During the second Temple the sacerdotal immersion could not be effected in a vessel, but had to take place in a hollow made in the ground, containing at least twenty-four cubic feet of water. The installation of the priest, which is here conducted by Moses, as the giver and representative of the Divine law, was during the second Temple performed by the Sanhedrin, who "sat in Moses' seat."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Washing, robing, anointing, sacrificing, are the four means by the joint operation of which the consecration is effected. The washing, or bathing, took place in the sight of the people. The whole of the person, except so much as was covered by the linen drawers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>), was <span class="cmt_word">washed</span>. The symbolical significance is clear. Cleansing from sin precedes clothing in righteousness and spiritual unction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-13 The consecration of Aaron and his sons had been delayed until the tabernacle had been prepared, and the laws of the sacrifices given. Aaron and his sons were washed with water, to signify that they ought to purify themselves from all sinful dispositions, and ever after to keep themselves pure. Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood whom he makes kings and priests to our God, Re 1:5,6; and those that draw near to God must be washed in pure water, Heb 10:22. The anointing of Aaron was to typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by measure to him. All believers have received the anointing.</body></html>
