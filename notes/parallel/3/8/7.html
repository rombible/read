It will be seen that the first article of dress--viz., the drawers--distinctly mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm" title="And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach:">Exodus 28:42</a>, is here omitted. This arises from the fact that, being nearest to the skin, Aaron put them on himself behind the curtain, immediately after his ablution.<p><span class= "bld">And girded him with the girdle.</span>--Not the band of the ephod, which is mentioned further on by the name of "curious girdle," but the one made of needlework, with which the tunic was girded about the loins. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-10.htm" title="And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.">Leviticus 6:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm" title="And you shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the girdle of needlework.">Exodus 28:39</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The robe.</span>--Called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31-35</a>, "the robe of the ephod," which was woven without seam, and was wholly blue. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-10.htm" title="And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.">Leviticus 6:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And put the ephod upon him.</span>--The ephod, which was the distinctive vestment of the high priest, was a sleeveless garment, and was worn over the shoulders. It was made of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine-twined linen, interwoven with golden threads. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-6.htm" title="And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.">Exodus 28:6-7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And he girded him with the curious girdle.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and girded him with the band. </span>This band was not only made of the same costly materials as the ephod, but was woven out of the same piece on either side of the garment, so that the ephod had as it were two hands, which constituted the band. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-8.htm" title="And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is on it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.">Exodus 28:8</a>.) It will be seen that this is entirely different from the girdle which was tied around the tunic, mentioned in the former part of this verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - The robing. The various articles of the priestly dress had been appointed and described before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28, 29</a>). In these verses we see the order in which they were <span class="cmt_word">put on</span>. After the priests had, no doubt, changed their linen drawers, there came, first, <span class="cmt_word">the coat</span>, that is, a close-fitting tunic of white linen, made with sleeves and covering the whole body; <span class="cmt_word">next the girdle</span> of the tunic, that is, a linen sash for tying the tunic round the body, with variegated ends hanging on each side to the ankles; thirdly, <span class="cmt_word">the robe</span>, that is, a blue vesture, woven of one piece, with holes for the head and arms to pass through, reaching from the neck to below the knee, the bottom being ornamented with blue, purple, and scarlet pomegranates, alternating with golden bells; fourthly, <span class="cmt_word">the ephod</span>, which consisted of two shoulder-pieces, or epaulettes, made of variegated linen and gold thread, fastened together in front and at the back by a narrow strap or band, from which hung, before and behind the wearer, two pieces of cloth confined below by <span class="cmt_word">the curious girdle of the ephod</span>, that is, by a sash made of the same material as the ephod itself. Into the ephod were sewn two onyxes, one on each shoulder, in gold filigree settings, one of them engraven with the names of half of the tribes, and the other with the remaining half; and from two rosettes or buttons by the side of these stones depended twisted gold chains for the support of the breastplate. Fifth came <span class="cmt_word">the breastplate</span>, which was a square pocket, made of embroidered linen, a span long and a span broad, worn upon the breast and hanging from the gold chains above mentioned, the lower ends of the gold chain being tied to two rings at the upper and outer corner of the breastplate, while the upper and inner corner of the same was attached to the ephod by blue thread running through two sets of rings in the breastplate and ephod respectively. The outer side of the breastplate was stiffened and adorned by twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three, each stone having on it the name of one of the tribes of Israel. The breastplate being double and the two sides and the bottom being sewn up, the pocket formed by it had its opening at the top. Into this pocket were placed <span class="cmt_word">the Urim and the Thummim</span>, which were probably two balls of different colours, one of which on being drawn out indicated the approval of God, and the other his disapproval, as to any point on which the high priest consulted him. (The Jewish tradition, that the Divine answer by the Urim and the Thummim came by a supernatural light thrown on certain letters in the names of the tribes, has no foundation.) The last part of the dress to be put on was <span class="cmt_word">the mitre</span>, or head-dress of linen, probably of the nature of a turban; to which, by a blue string, was attached <span class="cmt_word">the golden plate</span>, in such a way that it rested lengthwise on the forehead, and on this plate or <span class="cmt_word">holy crown</span> were inscribed the words," Holiness to the Lord." The investiture took place <span class="cmt_word">as the Lord commanded Moses</span>, that is, in accordance with the instructions given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. Its purpose and its meaning in the eyes of the people would have been twofold: first, after the manner of the king's crown and the judge's robe, it served to manifest the fact that the function of priest was committed to the wearer; and next, it symbolized the necessity of being clothed upon with the righteousness of God, in order to be able to act as interpreter and mediator between God and man, thus foreshadowing the Divine Nature of him who should be the Mediator in antitype. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-13 The consecration of Aaron and his sons had been delayed until the tabernacle had been prepared, and the laws of the sacrifices given. Aaron and his sons were washed with water, to signify that they ought to purify themselves from all sinful dispositions, and ever after to keep themselves pure. Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood whom he makes kings and priests to our God, Re 1:5,6; and those that draw near to God must be washed in pure water, Heb 10:22. The anointing of Aaron was to typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by measure to him. All believers have received the anointing.</body></html>
