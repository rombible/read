This portion consisted of the internal fat and tail, which was usually burnt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>), and the heave offering of <span class="cmt_word">the right shoulder</span>, or hind leg, which generally went to the officiating priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>), and one of each of the unleavened cakes. After this special ceremony of waving, peculiar to the rite of consecration, the usual wave offering (the breast) was waved by Moses and consumed by himself. Ordinarily it was for the priests in general (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>). The blood was poured on the side of the altar, as was done in all peace offerings, but in addition, on the present occasion, it was <span class="cmt_word">put upon the tip of</span> the <span class="cmt_word">right ear</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">upon the thumb of</span> the <span class="cmt_word">right hand</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">upon the great toe of</span> the <span class="cmt_word">right foot</span> of the priests who were being consecrated, symbolizing that their senses and active powers were being devoted to God's service. The same ceremony is to be used in the restoration of the leper (see chapter Leviticus 14:14). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:14-36 In these types we see our great High Priest, even Christ Jesus, solemnly appointed, anointed, and invested with his sacred office, by his own blood, and the influences of his Holy Spirit. He sanctifies the ordinances of religion, to the benefit of his people and the honour of God the Father; who for his sake accepts our worship, though it is polluted with sin. We may also rejoice, that he is a merciful and faithful High Priest, full of compassion to the feeble-minded and tempest-tossed soul. All true Christians are consecrated to be spiritual priests. We should seriously ask ourselves, whether in our daily walk we study to maintain this character? and abound in spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Christ? If so, still there is no cause for boasting. Let us not despise our fellow-sinners; but remembering what we have done, and how we are saved, let us seek and pray for their salvation.</body></html>
