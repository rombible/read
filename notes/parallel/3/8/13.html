But there is no statement here of their being anointed, although their anointing is ordered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>, and still more imperatively in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a>.

On the other hand, the high priest is specially designated as "the priest that is anointed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). It is probable that the personal anointing of the ordinary priests was confined to their being sprinkled with oil, as described below in verse 30; but that they were regarded as virtually anointed in Aaron's anointing. The Levites had no special dress until they obtained permission from Herod Agrippa I[. to wear the priestly robes (Joseph., 'Ant.,' 20:09, 6). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-13 The consecration of Aaron and his sons had been delayed until the tabernacle had been prepared, and the laws of the sacrifices given. Aaron and his sons were washed with water, to signify that they ought to purify themselves from all sinful dispositions, and ever after to keep themselves pure. Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood whom he makes kings and priests to our God, Re 1:5,6; and those that draw near to God must be washed in pure water, Heb 10:22. The anointing of Aaron was to typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by measure to him. All believers have received the anointing.</body></html>
