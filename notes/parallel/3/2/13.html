"To eat bread and salt together" is, in the East, an expression for a league of mutual amity (Russell, <span class= "ital">Aleppo, </span>i. 232). When the Arabs make a covenant together, they put salt on the blade of a sword, from whence every one puts a little into his mouth. This constitutes them blood relations, and they remain faithful to each other even when in danger of life (Ritter, Erd. 14:960). Hence the expression "a covenant of salt," which also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-19.htm" title="All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.">Numbers 18:19</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-5.htm" title="Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?">2Chronicles 13:5</a>, denotes an indissoluble alliance, an everlasting covenant. Hence, too, the phrase "salted with the salt of the palace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-14.htm" title="Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;">Ezra 4:14</a>) means bound by sacred obligations of fidelity to the king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt. Salt is commanded as symbolizing in things spiritual, because preserving in things physical, incorruption (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-34.htm">Luke 14:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>). It is an emblem of an established and enduring covenant, such as God's covenant with his people, which is never to wax old and be destroyed, and it is therefore termed the salt of the covenant of thy God. Hence "a covenant of salt" came to mean a covenant that should not be broken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>). The use of salt is not confined to the meat offering. With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. Accordingly we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-24.htm">Ezekiel 43:24</a>, "The priest shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:12-16 Salt is required in all the offerings. God hereby intimates to them that their sacrifices, in themselves, were unsavoury. All religious services must be seasoned with grace. Christianity is the salt of the earth. Directions are given about offering their first-fruits at harvest. If a man, with a thankful sense of God's goodness in giving him a plentiful crop, was disposed to present an offering to God, let him bring the first ripe and full ears. Whatever was brought to God must be the best in its kind, though it were but green ears of corn. Oil and frankincense must be put upon it. Wisdom and humility soften and sweeten the spirits and services of young people, and their green ears of corn shall be acceptable. God takes delight in the first ripe fruits of the Spirit, and the expressions of early piety and devotion. Holy love to God is the fire by which all our offerings must be made. The frankincense denotes the mediation and intercession of Christ, by which our services are accepted. Blessed be God that we have the substance, of which these observances were but shadows. There is that excellency in Christ, and in his work as Mediator, which no types and shadows can fully represent. And our dependence thereon must be so entire, that we must never lose sight of it in any thing we do, if we would be accepted of God.</body></html>
