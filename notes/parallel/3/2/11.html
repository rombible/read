Leaven and honey are not forbidden to be offered to the Lord; on the contrary, in the next verse they are commanded to be offered. The prohibition only extends to their being burnt on the altar, owing, no doubt, to the effect of fire upon them in making them swell and froth, thus creating a repulsive appearance which, as we shall see, throughout the Mosaic legislation, represents moral evil. The firstfruits of honey are to be offered (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29</a>), and leaven is to be used in the two wave loaves offered at the Feast of Pentecost as firstfruits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm">Leviticus 23:17</a>). the words translated, As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the Lord, should be rendered, <span class="accented">As an oblation of firstfruits ye shall offer them</span> (that <span class="accented">is</span>, leaven and honey), <span class="accented">but they shall not be burnt on the altar.</span> The mark in A.V. denoting a new paragraph at the beginning of verse 12, should be removed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Meat-offerings may typify Christ, as presented to God for us, and as being the Bread of life to our souls; but they rather seem to denote our obligation to God for the blessings of providence, and those good works which are acceptable to God. The term meat was, and still is, properly given to any kind of provision, and the greater part of this offering was to be eaten for food, not burned. These meat-offerings are mentioned after the burnt-offerings: without an interest in the sacrifice of Christ, and devotedness of heart to God, such services cannot be accepted. Leaven is the emblem of pride, malice, and hypocrisy, and honey of sensual pleasure. The former are directly opposed to the graces of humility, love, and sincerity, which God approves; the latter takes men from the exercises of devotion, and the practice of good works. Christ, in his character and sacrifice, was wholly free from the things denoted by leaven; and his suffering life and agonizing death were the very opposites to worldly pleasure. His people are called to follow, and to be like him.</body></html>
