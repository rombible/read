They have accordingly both to immerse their whole bodies, and remain unclean till sundown, and were debarred from the privileges of the sanctuary during that day. Hence abstinence from conjugal intercourse was regarded as a necessary preparation for the performance of sacred duties. He who had approached his wife could not draw nigh to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm" title="And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.">Exodus 19:15</a>), and was not allowed to partake of sacred meals. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/21-5.htm" title="And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.">1Samuel 21:5-6</a>.) The law of pollution was not designed to put a check upon marriage, since matrimony is a Divine institution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-27.htm" title="So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.">Genesis 1:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/2-21.htm" title="And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;">Genesis 2:21-25</a>), but it is intended to prevent husband and wife from making an immoderate use of their conjugal life, and thus to preserve them in health and vigour by prescribing such constant purifications after it. This is probably the reason why other nations of antiquity enacted similar laws. Thus the Hindoos and the Babylonians bathed after conjugal intercourse. The Egyptian priests abstained from it when they had to perform sacred duties, and the laity were not allowed to enter the precincts of the Temple unless they submitted to ablutions. Mahommed, for the same reason, enjoins lustrations upon all the faithful before reciting their prayers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The third case of an issue (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-33 Laws concerning ceremonial uncleanness. - We need not be curious in explaining these laws; but have reason to be thankful that we need fear no defilement, except that of sin, nor need ceremonial and burdensome purifications.
