He is, however, not to perform these rites as soon as he finds that the issue has ceased, but has to wait seven clear days, so as to afford sufficient time to ascertain whether the infirmity had actually disappeared. If any vestige of it was seen during these seven days, or even at the end of the seventh day, and after he was baptized, he had again to count seven other days.<p><span class= "bld">Bathe his flesh in running water.</span>--Or, more literally, <span class= "ital">living water. </span>It will be seen that whilst all other defiled persons and things were to be immersed in a collection of water, the restored man who had suffered from the issue in question was ordered to bathe in a fountain or in spring water.

It is more than probable that the term "flesh" has here, too, the euphemistic sense in which it has hitherto been used in this section. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/15-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When any man has a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.">Leviticus 15:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-7.htm" title="And he that touches the flesh of him that has the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:7</a>.) This derives support from the fact that whenever bathing of the body is ordered, the phrase for it throughout this section is uniformly "bathe in water" simply, which occurs no less than ten times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/15-5.htm" title="And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/15-10.htm" title="And whoever touches any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that bears any of those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-18.htm" title="The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/15-21.htm" title="And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-27.htm" title="And whoever touches those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:27</a>), and where the Authorised Version has in all cases inserted <span class= "ital">himself </span>in italics. This, moreover, seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the only passage in this section where the expression "flesh" is used in its literal sense for "body" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-16.htm" title="And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:16</a>), the sacred writer designedly added (<span class= "ital">?th kol</span>) "all," so that it might be distinguished from the euphemistic sense in which it is used in all the other passages in this section, This, however, would not exclude the bathing of the body as well, but, on the contrary, premises it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-33 Laws concerning ceremonial uncleanness. - We need not be curious in explaining these laws; but have reason to be thankful that we need fear no defilement, except that of sin, nor need ceremonial and burdensome purifications. These laws remind us that God sees all things, even those which escape the notice of men. The great gospel duties of faith and repentance are here signified, and the great gospel privileges of the application of Christ's blood to our souls for our justification, and his grace for our sanctification.</body></html>
