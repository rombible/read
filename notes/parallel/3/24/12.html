Though this was a transgression of the third commandment, and though it was ordained that he who cursed his earthly parent should be put to death (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm" title="For every one that curses his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be on him.">Leviticus 20:9</a>), yet no law existed as to the exact punishment which was to be inflicted upon him who cursed his heavenly Father (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a>); nor was it known whether such an offender should be left to God Himself to execute the sentence. For this reason the criminal was detained till Moses had appealed to the Lord for instruction, in order that he might direct the people accordingly. Similar instances of Moses appealing direct to the Lord for guidance in matters of law and judgment we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-34.htm" title="And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.">Numbers 15:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/28-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 28:1-5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they put him in ward.</span> The same course was followed in the case of the man found gathering sticks upon the sabbath day: "And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-34.htm">Numbers 15:34</a>). The same penalty was awarded in both cases. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:10-23 This offender was the son of an Egyptian father, and an Israelitish mother. The notice of his parents shows the common ill effect of mixed marriages. A standing law for the stoning of blasphemers was made upon this occasion. Great stress is laid upon this law. It extends to the strangers among them, as well as to those born in the land. Strangers, as well as native Israelites, should be entitled to the benefit of the law, so as not to suffer wrong; and should be liable to the penalty of this law, in case they did wrong. If those who profane the name of God escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgments. What enmity against God must be in the heart of man, when blasphemies against God proceed out of his mouth. If he that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, of what punishment will they be worthy, who despise and abuse the gospel of the Son of God! Let us watch against anger, do no evil, avoid all connexions with wicked people, and reverence that holy name which sinners blaspheme.</body></html>
