Of the manner in which the shewbread, or the <span class= "ital">"</span>bread of His Presence," was renewed every Sabbath during the second Temple, we have a minute account. "Four priests entered the holy place, two of them carried in their hands the two piles of the cakes, and two carried in their hands the two incense cups, four priests having gone in before them, two to take off the two old piles, and two to take off the two incense cups. Those who brought in the new stood at the north side with their faces to the south, and those who took away the old stood at the south side with their faces to the north. As soon as the one party lifted up the old, the others put down the new, so that their hands were exactly over against each other, because it is written, before my Presence continually" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-30.htm" title="And you shall set on the table show bread before me always.">Exodus 25:30</a>). The authorities during the second Temple took the expression "continually" to denote that the cakes were not to be absent for one moment. Hence the simultaneous action of the two sets of priests, one lifting up the old, and the other at once putting down the new shewbread.<p><span class= "bld">Being taken from the children of Israel.</span>--Like the daily sacrifices, the offerings for the congregation, the salt for the sacrifices, the wood for the altar, the incense, the omer (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-10.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:">Leviticus 23:10-11</a>), the two wave-loaves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm" title="You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:17</a>), the scapegoat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-5.htm" title="And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:5</a>, &c.), the red heifer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/19-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,">Numbers 19:1-22</a>), &c., the shewbread, or the "bread of His Presence," according to the canon that obtained during the second Temple, were purchased with the people's half-shekels, which every Israelite had to contribute annually toward the maintenance of the service in the sanctuary.
