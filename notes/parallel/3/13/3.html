The authorities during the second Temple defined it that there must at least be two hairs white, at the root and in the body of the bright spot, before the patient can be declared unclean. The word <span class= "ital">plague, </span>in accordance with a usage common in Hebrew--to put the abstract for the concrete--denotes here the plagued spot, or the spot affected by the plague, whilst in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-4.htm" title="If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague seven days:">Leviticus 13:4</a> it means the person affected by this disorder. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-32.htm" title="You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:32</a>, "the hoary head" stands for <span class= "ital">hoary-headed person.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the plague in sight be deeper than the skin.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and the appearance of the plagued spot be deeper, &c. </span>The second symptom which shows the development of the disorder is that the spot affected by this plague appears to be deeper than the rest of the skin.<p><span class= "bld">Pronounce him unclean.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">make him unclean. </span>According to the frequently occurring phraseology a man is said to <span class= "ital">do </span>that which in his official capacity <span class= "ital">he </span>pronounces as done, or orders to be done. Thus Ezekiel is said "to destroy the city" when he simply foretold its destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm" title="And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.">Ezekiel 43:3</a>). The existence of these two symptoms made it incumbent upon the priest to declare the person unclean, and hence imparting defilement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the hair in the plague is turned white.</span> This is the first symptom, and the most noticeable as the commencement of the disease. The hair around the spot loses its colour and becomes thin and weak, the separate hairs being hardly stronger or individually thicker than down. The second symptom is when <span class="cmt_word">the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh</span>; that is, below the upper skin, or cuticle, and in the real cutis. These two symptoms distinguish real leprosy from other affections which at first bear a similar appearance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-17 The plague of leprosy was an uncleanness, rather than a disease. Christ is said to cleanse lepers, not to cure them. Common as the leprosy was among the Hebrews, during and after their residence in Egypt, we have no reason to believe that it was known among them before. Their distressed state and employment in that land must have rendered them liable to disease. But it was a plague often inflicted immediately by the hand of God. Miriam's leprosy, and Gehazi's, and king Uzziah's, were punishments of particular sins; no marvel there was care taken to distinguish it from a common distemper. The judgment of it was referred to the priests. And it was a figure of the moral pollutions of men's minds by sin, which is the leprosy of the soul, defiling to the conscience, and from which Christ alone can cleanse. The priest could only convict the leper, (by the law is the knowledge of sin,) but Christ can cure the sinner, he can take away sin. It is a work of great importance, but of great difficulty, to judge of our spiritual state. We all have cause to suspect ourselves, being conscious of sores and spots; but whether clean or unclean is the question. As there were certain marks by which to know it was leprosy, so there are marks of such as are in the gall of bitterness. The priest must take time in making his judgment. This teaches all, both ministers and people, not to be hasty in censures, nor to judge anything before the time. If some men's sins go before unto judgment, the sins of others follow after, and so do men's good works. If the person suspected were found to be clean, yet he must wash his clothes, because there had been ground for the suspicion. We have need to be washed in the blood of Christ from our spots, though not leprosy spots; for who can say, I am pure from sin?</body></html>
