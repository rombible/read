The ancient canons distinctly define this by "that which is burnt with a coal or with embers, whatsoever is from the force of actual fire, is the burning here meant," in contradistinction to the burn or inflammation mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-18.htm" title="The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,">Leviticus 13:18</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And the quick flesh that burneth.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and the sound flesh of the burning </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-10.htm" title="And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;">Leviticus 13:10</a>), that is, the tender flesh which is renewed (after it has lost the purulent matter in it) and exhibits these symptoms.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-28.</span> - The method of discriminating between a leprous spot and the scar of a burn. <span class="cmt_word">If there be any flesh, in the skin whereof</span> there is <span class="cmt_word">a hot burning</span>. This rendering indicates that the authors of the Authorized Version thought a disease of the nature of a carbuncle to be meant; but it is better to take the words literally as they are translated in the margin, <span class="accented">If there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a burning of fire</span>; that is, a scar from a burn, The leprous spot and the scar are to be distinguished as in the previous case. An old nicer or burn is a more likely place for a leprous spot to appear than any part of the body which is sound, just as in the moral sphere sin fixes on some old wound of the soul to burst out in. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:18-44 The priest is told what judgment to make, if there were any appearance of a leprosy in old sores; and such is the danger of those who having escaped the pollutions of the world are again entangled therein. Or, in a burn by accident, ver. 24. The burning of strife and contention often occasions the rising and breaking out of that corruption, which proves that men are unclean. Human life lies exposed to many grievances. With what troops of diseases are we beset on every side; and thy all entered by sin! If the constitution be healthy, and the body lively and easy, we are bound to glorify God with our bodies. Particular note was taken of the leprosy, if in the head. If the leprosy of sin has seized the head; if the judgment be corrupted, and wicked principles, which support wicked practices, are embraced, it is utter uncleanness, from which few are cleansed. Soundness in the faith keeps leprosy from the head.</body></html>
