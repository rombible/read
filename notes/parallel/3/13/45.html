During the second Temple the administrators of the law exempted leprous women from rending their clothes, which was evidently owing to a feeling of decorum.<p><span class= "bld">And his head bare.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and his hair be dishevelled. </span>This was another sign of mourning. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come on all the people: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.">Leviticus 10:6</a>.) The legislators during the second Temple also exempted leprous women from letting their hair fall in the disorderly and wild manner over their heads and faces which was the custom for mourners to do.<p><span class= "bld">And he shall put a covering upon his upper lip.</span>--To veil the beard, which was the pride of the Oriental, was also a sign of mourning. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm" title="Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of your head on you, and put on your shoes on your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men.">Ezekiel 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-22.htm" title="And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.">Ezekiel 24:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-7.htm" title="Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yes, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.">Micah 3:7</a>.) This was generally done by throwing the skirt of the garment over the lower part of the chin.<p><span class= "bld">And shall cry, Unclean.</span>--As leprosy was most defiling, and as the very entrance of a leper into a house rendered everything in it unclean, the person thus afflicted had to warn off the passers by, lest they should approach him, and by contact with him become defiled. In some instances this was done by a herald, who preceded the leper. Hence the rendering of the ancient Chaldee paraphrase of Jonathan by "a herald shall proclaim, and say, Depart, depart from the unclean !"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 45, 46.</span> - The cases for examination having been discussed, the law for the treatment of the man in whom leprosy has been proved to exist is pronounced. <span class="cmt_word">The leper in whom the plague</span> is to be ex-eluded from the camp, lest others should contract defilement from him. He is for the same reason to <span class="cmt_word">cry, Unclean, unclean</span>, lest any wayfarer should unwittingly come in contact with him; and <span class="cmt_word">his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip</span>, these being the signs of mourning for the dead. The bared or disheveled head (see chapter Leviticus 10:6) and the covered lip are incidentally mentioned as signs of mourning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>, and the covered upper lip as a mark of shame in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>. By the expression, He shall dwell alone, is meant he shall dwell apart from those who were clean. Of course, lepers would naturally associate with each other, and so we find that they actually did (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12</a>). As their presence was supposed to defile any place that they entered, they were punished in later times with forty stripes if they did not observe the restraints laid down for them. "They were, however, admitted to the synagogue, where a place was railed off for them, ten handbreadths high and four cubits wide, on condition of their entering the house of worship before the rest of the congregation and leaving it after them" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The exclusion of the leper was not for the purpose of avoiding contagion, nor to serve as a penalty for having contracted so loathsome a disease, but primarily to prevent the spread of ceremonial uncleanness communicated by his touch, and typically and mystically to teach that the fate brought upon a man by unremoved sin is separation from the people of God here and hereafter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:45,46 When the priest had pronounced the leper unclean, it put a stop to his business in the world, cut him off from his friends and relations, and ruined all the comfort he could have in the world. He must humble himself under the mighty hand of God, not insisting upon his cleanness, when the priest had pronounced him unclean, but accepting the punishment. Thus must we take to ourselves the shame that belongs to us, and with broken hearts call ourselves Unclean, unclean; heart unclean, life unclean; unclean by original corruption, unclean by actual transgression; unclean, therefore deserving to be for ever shut out from communion with God, and all hope of happiness in him; unclean, therefore undone, if infinite mercy do not interpose. The leper must warn others to take heed of coming near him. He must then be shut out of the camp, and afterward, when they came to Canaan, be shut out of the city, town, or village where he lived, and dwell with none but those that were lepers like himself. This typified the purity which ought to be in the gospel church.</body></html>
