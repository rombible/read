The theory, therefore, that "plague of leprosy" is here used figuratively of garments fretted by a species of animalculae or vermin, which feed upon and corrode the finer parts of the texture in the manner of moths, is contrary to the uniform import of this phrase in the discussion of the disorder, and is against the testimony of the administrators of the law during the second Temple, who came in personal contact with the complaint. They assure us that leprosy of garments and houses was not to be found in the world generally, but was a sign and miracle in Israel to guard them against an evil tongue. Equally untenable is the theory that it denotes an infectious condition of clothes caused by contact with the leprous matter of wounds and boils, which is so strong that it corrodes and injures all kinds of texture. Neither the regulations here laid down, nor the further development of them exhibited in the canons which obtained during the second Temple, regard leprosy as contagious. This is evident from the fact that the priest was in constant and close contact with the leper; that the leper who was <span class= "ital">entirely </span>covered was pronounced clean, and could mix with the community (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/13-12.htm" title="And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that has the plague from his head even to his foot, wherever the priest looks;">Leviticus 13:12-13</a>); that the priest himself ordered all the things in a leprous house to be taken out before he entered it, in order that they might be used again (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-36.htm" title="Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:">Leviticus 14:36</a>); that according to the ancient canons a leprous minor, a leprous heathen or proselyte, as well as leprous garments in houses of non-Israelites, do not render any one unclean, nor does a bridegroom who is seized with this malady during the nuptial week defile any one. All this most unquestionably implies that there was no fear of contagion on the part of the authorities who had personally to deal with this distemper.<p><span class= "bld">Whether it be a woollen garment.</span>--As among the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, woollen and linen garments were the only apparel worn by the Israelites. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-11.htm" title="You shall not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together.">Deuteronomy 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm" title="And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.">Hosea 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-11.htm" title="I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.">Hosea 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-13.htm" title="She seeks wool, and flax, and works willingly with her hands.">Proverbs 31:13</a>.) The administrators of the law during the second Temple, however, took this enactment literally as referring strictly to wool of sheep and flax, but not to hemp and other materials. Hence they declared that a material made of camels' hair and sheep's wool is not rendered unclean by leprosy if the camels' hair preponderates, but is unclean when the sheep's hair preponderates, or when both are equal. The same rule also applies to mixtures of flax and hemp. Dyed skins and garments are not rendered unclean by leprosy. We have here another proof that these authorities did not regard leprosy as contagious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - Whether it be a <span class="cmt_word">woolen garment</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">a linen garment</span>. Wool and flax are the two materials for clothes mentioned in Deuteronomy 22:11; Proverbs 31:13; Hosea 2:7. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:47-59 The garment suspected to be tainted with leprosy was not to be burned immediately. If, upon search, it was found that there was a leprous spot, it must be burned, or at least that part of it. If it proved to be free, it must be washed, and then might be used. This also sets forth the great evil there is in sin. It not only defiles the sinner's conscience, but it brings a stain upon all he has and all that he does. And those who make their clothes servants to their pride and lust, may see them thereby tainted with leprosy. But the robes of righteousness never fret, nor are moth-eaten.</body></html>
