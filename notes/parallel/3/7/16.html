The distinction between them, as defined by the canon law, which obtained in the time of Christ, is as follows :--A vow (<span class= "ital">n?d?r</span>) is an obligation voluntarily imposed upon oneself with the formula, "Behold, I take it upon myself to bring a bullock, &c., for a peace offering." This undertaking is binding upon the person till he fulfils it. Hence, if the bullock in question dies, or is stolen, or becomes disqualified for a sacrifice, he must bring another. A free-will offering (<span class= "ital">nedabah</span>) simply pledges voluntarily a certain animal for a peace offering, with the formula, " Behold, this animal I devote for a peace offering." Hence, if the animal in question dies, or is stolen, or has otherwise become disqualified for sacrifice, the obligation ceases, since it does not extend beyond the animal thus devoted.<p><span class= "bld">It shall be eaten the same day.</span>--As both these votive offerings were an indirect mode of supplication having respect to future favours, and hence were not a spontaneous expression of pious devotion, they were not so sacred as the former. They were, therefore, allowed to be eaten both on the day of presentation and on the following day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-27 As to the peace-offerings, in the expression of their sense of mercy, God left them more at liberty, than in the expression of their sense of sin; that their sacrifices, being free-will offerings, might be the more acceptable, while, by obliging them to bring the sacrifices of atonement, God shows the necessity of the great Propitiation. The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease. Therefore this law is not now in force on believers.</body></html>
