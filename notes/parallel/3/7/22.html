Probably it was silently abrogated; but the prohibition of blood was undoubtedly perpetual (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>), and it is based on a principle which does not apply to the fat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-27 As to the peace-offerings, in the expression of their sense of mercy, God left them more at liberty, than in the expression of their sense of sin; that their sacrifices, being free-will offerings, might be the more acceptable, while, by obliging them to bring the sacrifices of atonement, God shows the necessity of the great Propitiation. The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease. Therefore this law is not now in force on believers.</body></html>
