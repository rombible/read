Sustaining this high position, and being the intercessor between God and man, such outward expressions of sorrow might lead those in whose behalf he ministers in the sanctuary to believe that he thereby impugns the justice of the Divine judgment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-15.</span> - The high priest, <span class="cmt_word">upon whose head the anointing off was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments,</span> symbolizing in his person the Holy One in a more special manner than the other priests, has to aim so much the more at symbolical holiness. He may not, therefore. incur legal uncleanness by taking part in the funeral rites, even of his father or mother, not being permitted to absent himself from the sanctuary, which he would have to do if he had thus ceremonially defiled himself. Nor is it enough that he should abstain from taking an immoral or a divorced wife; he may only wed <span class="cmt_word">a virgin and of his own people,</span> whereas the other priests might marry widows and the daughters of strangers dwelling among the Israelites. In the ordinances for priests given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44.htm">Ezekiel 44</a>, the ordinary priests, as well as the high priest, are forbidden to marry widows, unless they be the widows of priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-22.htm">Ezekiel 44:22</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-24 Laws concerning the priests. - As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must be followers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate the Saviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.</body></html>
