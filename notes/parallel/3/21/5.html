Thus, in the graphic description of the idolatrous priests mourning, we are told "the priests sit in their temples, having their clothes rent, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads." (Bar 6:31.) The three things here prohibited to the priests are also forbidden to the people at large under other circumstances. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>.) The ordinary Israelites, however, indulged in the same practices. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm" title="Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-18.htm" title="They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.">Ezekiel 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm" title="And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.">Amos 8:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-24 Laws concerning the priests. - As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must be followers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate the Saviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.</body></html>
