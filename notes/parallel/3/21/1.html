This fact, moreover, as the authorities during the second Temple remark, imposes upon the priests the duty of bringing up their children in such a manner as to make them morally and intellectually fit to occupy this hereditary office. They also deduce from the emphatic position of the term "priests," that it only applies to those of them who are fit to perform their sacerdotal duties, and not to the disqualified priests (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-15.htm" title="Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.">Leviticus 21:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">There shall none be defiled for the dead.</span>--<p>Better, <span class= "ital">He shall not defile himself for a dead person; </span>that is, the priest is not to contract defilement by contact with the body of any dead person. What constitutes defilement is not specified, but, as is often the case, was left to the administrators of the Law to define more minutely. Accordingly, they enacted that not only touching a dead body, but coming within four cubits of it, entering the house where the corpse lay, entering a burial place, following to the grave, or the manifestation of mourning for the departed, pollutes the priest, and consequently renders him unfit for performing the services of the sanctuary, and for engaging in the services for the people. This they deduced from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/19-11.htm" title="He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:11-16</a>. The Egyptian priests were likewise bound to keep aloof from "burials and graves, from impure men and women." The Romans ordered a bough of a cypress-tree to be stuck at the door of the house in which a dead body was lying, lest a chief priest should unwittingly enter and defile himself.<p><span class= "bld">Among his people</span>--That is, among the tribes or people of Israel, the Jewish community (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm" title="When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-3.htm" title="Yes, he loved the people; all his saints are in your hand: and they sat down at your feet; every one shall receive of your words.">Deuteronomy 33:3</a>, &c.). Hence the authorities during the second Temple concluded that when the corpse is among the people whose duty it is to see to its burial, the priest is forbidden to take part in it; but when a priest, or even the high priest, finds a human body in the road where he cannot call on any one to bury it, he is obliged to perform this last sacred office to the dead himself. When it is borne in mind how much the ancient Hebrews thought of burial, and that nothing exceeded their horror than to think of an unburied corpse of any one belonging to them, this humane legislation will be duly appreciated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - The first paragraph refers to ceremonial uncleanness derived to the priest from his family relations. The priest may not take part in any funeral rites, the effect of which was legal defilement, except in the case of the death of his father, mother, son, daughter, brother, and unmarried sister. These are all that appear to be mentioned. But what, then, are we to understand regarding his wife? Was the priest allowed to lake part in mourning ceremonies for her or not? It is thought by some that her case is met by verse 4, <span class="cmt_word">But he shall not defile himself,</span> being <span class="cmt_word">a chief man among his people, to profane himself.</span> The literal translation of this verse is. <span class="accented">He shall not be defiled, a lord</span> (<span class="accented">haul</span>) <span class="accented">among his people.</span> The word <span class="accented">baal</span>, or <span class="accented">lord</span>, is commonly used in the sense of <span class="accented">husband.</span> The clause, therefore, may be understood to forbid the priest to mourn for his wife, being rendered, <span class="accented">He shall not defile himself as an husband</span> (i.e., <span class="accented">for his wife</span>) <span class="accented">among his people.</span> This, however, is something of a forced rendering. The words arc better understood to mean, <span class="accented">He shall not defile himself as a master of a house among his people</span>; that is, he may not lake part in the funeral rites of slaves or other members of the household, which ordinarily brought defilement on the master of a house. Then is the priest forbidden to mourn for his wife? This we can hardly believe, when he might mourn for father and mother, son and daughter, brother and sister. Nor is it necessary to take this view. For the case of the wife is covered by the words. <span class="cmt_word">For his kin, that is near unto him.... he may be defiled.</span> The wife, being so closely attached to the husband, is not specifically named, because that was not necessary, but is included under the expression, <span class="accented">his kin, that is near unto him</span>, just as daughter, grandmother, niece, and wife's sister, are covered by the phrase, "near of kin," without being specifically named in chapter Leviticus 18 (see note on chapter Leviticus 16:18). Even when mourning is permitted, the priest is to use no excessive forms of it, still less any that have been used by idolaters. <span class="cmt_word">They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>), <span class="cmt_word">nor make any cuttings in their flesh</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>). And the reason why they are to avoid ceremonial uncleanness in some cases, and to act with sobriety and gravity in all, is that they are dedicated to God, <span class="cmt_word">to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire, the bread of their God;</span> that is, the sacrifices which are consumed by the fire of the altar symbolizing the action of God (see note on Leviticus 3:11). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-24 Laws concerning the priests. - As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must be followers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate the Saviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.</body></html>
