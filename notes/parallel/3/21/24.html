The sacerdotal laws were administered and enforced by the elders or Sanhedrim, who were the representatives of the people. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-21.htm" title="No man that has a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come near to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.">Leviticus 21:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-24 Laws concerning the priests. - As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must be followers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate the Saviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.</body></html>
