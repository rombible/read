The translation <span class="cmt_word">dwarf</span>, in verse 20, is better than the marginal rendering "too slender," or withered. Being the descendants of Aaron, these priests, blemished as they were, were to be supported as the other priests were supported. <span class="cmt_word">He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy;</span> that is, the priests' portions of the meat offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-17.htm">Leviticus 6:17</a>), of the sin offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-29.htm">Leviticus 6:29</a>), of the trespass offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-1.htm">Leviticus 7:1</a>), of the shewbread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>), which were most holy, and of the heave offerings, wave offerings, firstfruit offerings, firstlings, and things devoted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-11.htm">Numbers 11:11-19</a>), which were holy. They were also apparently employed in the less formal and conspicuous duties of the priests, such as examining lepers, and any other functions which did not bring them <span class="cmt_word">nigh unto the altar</span>. But they were not to <span class="cmt_word">profane God's sanctuaries</span>, by which is meant the holy of holies, the holy place, and the court in which the altar stood. To none of these is the blemished priest to be admitted for the purpose of officiating, though he might enter the court and probably the holy place for other purposes, and might eat the offerings of the priests in the accustomed place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-24 Laws concerning the priests. - As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must be followers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate the Saviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.</body></html>
