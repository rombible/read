(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm" title="This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.">Leviticus 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-25.htm" title="And whoever bears ought of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:25</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">And shave off all his hair.</span>--The razor had to pass over the whole of his body, even his secret parts. A similar process was undertaken at the consecration of the Levites. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-7.htm" title="And thus shall you do to them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying on them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.">Numbers 8:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And shall tarry abroad out of his tent</span>--But though permitted to return to the camp, yet he had to live the first week out of his own house. This the authorities during the second Temple rightly regarded as an euphemism for seclusion from connubial intercourse during the first seven days, in order that he might not contract impurity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-10.htm" title="And whoever touches any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that bears any of those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:10</a>), and thus interrupt the period of holy preparation. Hence the ancient Chaldee Version of the so-called Jonathan translates it: "He shall sit without the tent of the house of his habitation, and shall not come near to the side of his wife seven days." With this ended the first stage of purification, which restored the convalescent to his social or civil privileges, but not to the sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - After the healed leper has <span class="cmt_word">washed his clothes, and shaved off all his hair, and washed himself with water,</span> so as to leave no remnant of his former defilement that can be removed, the first stage of his purification is over. He is restored to the camp, but not yet to the sanctuary, nor to his position as head or member of his family. He has still to undergo another week's purgation, and until that time has elapsed he may not live in his tent. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-9 The priests could not cleanse the lepers; but when the Lord removed the plague, various rules were to be observed in admitting them again to the ordinances of God, and the society of his people. They represent many duties and exercises of truly repenting sinners, and the duties of ministers respecting them. If we apply this to the spiritual leprosy of sin, it intimates that when we withdraw from those who walk disorderly, we must not count them as enemies, but admonish them as brethren. And also that when God by his grace has brought to repentance, they ought with tenderness and joy, and sincere affection, to be received again. Care should always be taken that sinners may not be encouraged, nor penitents discouraged. If it were found that the leprosy was healed, the priest must declare it with the particular solemnities here described. The two birds, one killed, and the other dipped in the blood of the bird that was killed, and then let loose, may signify Christ shedding his blood for sinners, and rising and ascending into heaven. The priest having pronounced the leper clean from the disease, he must make himself clean from all remains of it. Thus those who have comfort of the remission of their sins, must with care and caution cleanse themselves from sins; for every one that has this hope in him, will be concerned to purify himself.</body></html>
