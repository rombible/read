During the second Temple, restored lepers bathed in a chamber at the north-western corner of the Court of the Women, called the "chamber of the lepers."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-32.</span> - The ceremonies in the second stage of cleansing, which restored the late outcast to his home and to his covenant-right, were the following; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> At the end of seven days he repeated the process of washing, shaving, and bathing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> On the eighth day he brought a lamb for a trespass offering, a leg of oil, a meat offering, a sin offering, and a burnt offering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The priest that officiated at the cleansing presented him and his offerings at the door of the tabernacle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> He offered the trespass offering and the log of oil for him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> He slew the trespass offering and put some of the blood of it on different parts of the man's body. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> He poured some of the oil into his left hand, and having sprinkled some of it seven times before the Lord, he placed some of it on those parts of the man's body on which the blood had been placed, and poured the rest upon his head. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> He offered the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the meat offering. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it shall be on the seventh day.</span> The pause for seven days, followed by placing the blood on the tip of the right ear, and on the thumb of the right hand, and on the great toe of the right foot, and the subsequent anointing with off, irresistibly call to mind the ceremonies of the consecration of priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-35.htm">Leviticus 8:35, 23, 24, 12, 30</a>), and no doubt they are intended to do so. The whole nation was in a sense a priestly nation, and the restoration of the lapsed member to his rights was therefore a quasi-consecration. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-9 The priests could not cleanse the lepers; but when the Lord removed the plague, various rules were to be observed in admitting them again to the ordinances of God, and the society of his people. They represent many duties and exercises of truly repenting sinners, and the duties of ministers respecting them. If we apply this to the spiritual leprosy of sin, it intimates that when we withdraw from those who walk disorderly, we must not count them as enemies, but admonish them as brethren. And also that when God by his grace has brought to repentance, they ought with tenderness and joy, and sincere affection, to be received again. Care should always be taken that sinners may not be encouraged, nor penitents discouraged. If it were found that the leprosy was healed, the priest must declare it with the particular solemnities here described. The two birds, one killed, and the other dipped in the blood of the bird that was killed, and then let loose, may signify Christ shedding his blood for sinners, and rising and ascending into heaven. The priest having pronounced the leper clean from the disease, he must make himself clean from all remains of it. Thus those who have comfort of the remission of their sins, must with care and caution cleanse themselves from sins; for every one that has this hope in him, will be concerned to purify himself.</body></html>
