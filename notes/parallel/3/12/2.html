This general statement is afterwards specified by the phrases "and born a man child," and "bear a maid child," in the verse before us, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-5.htm" title="But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three score and six days.">Leviticus 12:5</a>. Thus the regulations about impurity naturally begin with the beginning of life. According to the administrators of the law during the second Temple, the regulations here set forth with regard to the deliverance are in force even when it is an untimely birth, or when the child is born dead, provided it has a perfect shape, which it assumes after forty days of its conception. Amongst the Hindoos, too, the mother in case of a miscarriage remains in a state of defilement as many nights as months have elapsed since her conception.<p><span class= "bld">And born a man child.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and giveth birth to a male child. </span>The expression rendered here in the Authorised Version by "a man child" is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-7.htm" title="Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that has born a male or a female.">Leviticus 12:7</a> simply "male." In so short a paragraph discussing the same enactment it is important that words identical in the original should be translated uniformly in English.<p><span class= "bld">She shall be unclean seven days.</span>--Though the issue of blood which succeeds child-birth generally only lasts three or four days, yet the period of uncleanness is extended to seven days to include exceptional cases.<p><span class= "bld">According to the days . . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">as in the days of the uncleanness of her monthly courses, </span>that is, her uncleanness is to be of the same duration, and she is to observe the same rules, and be subjected to the same restraints as during the period of her menstruation. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm" title="And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:19</a>.) The fact that reference is here made to the regulations about the periodical impurity of women which have not as yet been laid down shows that, like other laws, this law was already known to and generally practised by the Jews before it was finally fixed in the Levitical code.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She shall be unclean seven days.</span> The mother is to be <span class="accented">unclean seven days</span>, and after that to be <span class="cmt_word">in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days</span> (verse 4). The difference between these two states maybe seen by looking on to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19-28</a>, and comparing that passage with verse 4 of this chapter. In the first stage, during the seven days, she made all that she touched unclean; in the second stage, during the thirty-three days, she was only required to <span class="cmt_word">touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary</span>, as she was progressing towards cleanness. The number of days during which she is to be altogether unclean is to be <span class="cmt_word">according to the days of the separation for her infirmity</span>, that is, seven days, as in the case of her monthly courses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.</span> The Levitical legislation recognizes the regulation as to the day of the circumcision made at the time of the covenant with Abraham. "And he that is eight days old (or a son of eight days) shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.</span> "When in a state of impurity, the Hebrews were forbidden to enter the sanctuary, to keep the Passover, and to partake of holy food, whether of sacrificial meat, of sacred offerings and gifts, or of shew-bread, because the clean only were fit to approach the holy God and all that appertains to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-19.htm">Leviticus 7:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-3.htm">Leviticus 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a>)' (Kalisch). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Ceremonial purification. - After the laws concerning clean and unclean food, come the laws concerning clean and unclean persons.
