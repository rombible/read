The offerings were brought at the expiration of the fortieth day in the case of a boy, and at the end of the eightieth day in the case of a girl, that is, on the forty-first and on the eighty-first respectively.<p><span class= "bld">For a son, or for a daughter.</span>--That is, with regard to a son or a daughter, to either of which she had given birth. The purification was for herself, and was owing to the defiling discharges connected with childbirth, and not for the child to which she gave birth, since the baby was not unclean.<p><span class= "bld">She shall bring a lamb of the first year.</span>--Or, as the Margin has it, <span class= "ital">a son of his year, </span>that is, a lamb which was within the year of its birth. This burnt offering was an expression of gratitude for the Divine mercy vouchsafed to her in the hours of sorrow and danger, or, as some ancients suggest, it was designed as a confession of impatient and reproachful thoughts harboured by the mother during her pregnancy and the time of parturition (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-22.htm" title="And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.">Genesis 25:22</a>); whilst the sin offering was to atone for sinful and violent expressions which she may have heedlessly uttered in the hours of labour and agony. Though when the two sacrifices are mentioned together, the sin offering generally precedes the burnt offering (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-7.htm" title="And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he has committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-31.htm" title="Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.">Leviticus 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-15.htm" title="And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.">Leviticus 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-30.htm" title="And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.">Leviticus 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-3.htm" title="Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-5.htm" title="And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:5</a>, &c.), here the burnt offering takes precedence, because it is the more costly of the two. Besides the mother after child-birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-6.htm" title="And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest:">Leviticus 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-8.htm" title="And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.">Leviticus 12:8</a>), there were three other unclean persons who had to bring a sin offering for their uncleanness: the leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-19.htm" title="And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:">Leviticus 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-31.htm" title="Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.">Leviticus 14:31</a>), the woman that had an issue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-15.htm" title="And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.">Leviticus 15:15</a>), and the man that had an issue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-30.htm" title="And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.">Leviticus 15:30</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to the entrance of the tent of meeting. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm" title="If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.">Leviticus 1:3</a>.) During the time of the second Temple these sacrifices were brought to the eastern gate, called the Gate of Nicanor. Here the lying-in women were purified and the lepers cleansed. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-13.htm" title="And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:">Leviticus 14:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - The previous verses having stated the conditions and the term of continuance of the uncleanness arising from childbirth, the three final verses describe the offerings to be made by the woman for her purification. <span class="cmt_word">She shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering.</span> Two things are noticeable here: first, that the burnt offering, symbolizing self-devotion, is far more costly and important than the sin offering, which had not to be offered for any individual personal sin, but only for human sin, "which had been indirectly manifested in her bodily condition" (Keil); and secondly, that in this one case the sin offering appears to succeed the burnt offering instead of preceding it. No doubt the changed order is owing to the cause just mentioned; the idea of sin, though it may not be altogether put aside (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>), is not to be prominent, as though it were peculiar to the special woman who was purified. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-8 Ceremonial purification. - After the laws concerning clean and unclean food, come the laws concerning clean and unclean persons. Man imparts his depraved nature to his offspring, so that, excepting as the atonement of Christ and the sanctification of the Spirit prevent, the original blessing, Increase and multiply, Ge 1:28, is become to the fallen race a direful curse, and communicates sin and misery. Let those women who have received mercy from God in child-bearing, with all thankfulness own God's goodness to them; and this shall please the Lord better than sacrifices.</body></html>
