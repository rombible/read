that is, they must either be both turtle-doves or both pigeons, and not one turtle-dove and one pigeon. Turtle-doves and pigeons were plentiful and cheap in Palestine (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-14.htm" title="And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.">Leviticus 1:14</a>). It was therefore the poor woman's sacrifice which the mother of our Lord offered, when, in accordance with this commutation, she offered a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons, on presenting herself for purification at the Temple with the child Jesus, on the expiration of the prescribed term of uncleanness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-24.htm" title="And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.">Luke 2:24</a>), and the priest, after sprinkling her with the blood of the humble sacrifice, declared her cleansed.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If she be not able to bring a lamb.</span> A concession is made to poverty, which in later times appears to have been largely acted on.

Man imparts his depraved nature to his offspring, so that, excepting as the atonement of Christ and the sanctification of the Spirit prevent, the original blessing, Increase and multiply, Ge 1:28, is become to the fallen race a direful curse, and communicates sin and misery. Let those women who have received mercy from God in child-bearing, with all thankfulness own God's goodness to them; and this shall please the Lord better than sacrifices.</body></html>
