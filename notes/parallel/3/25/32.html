They constituted the share of the national property which was assigned to the tribe of Levi, and so far stood in the same relation to them as the land did to the other tribes. They therefore returned to the original possessor or his representative in the year of jubilee, and might at any earlier time be redeemed. The words, <span class="cmt_word">Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites,</span> should rather be rendered, <span class="accented">But in respect to the cities of the Levites.</span> There is a difficulty also as to the translation of the clause, <span class="cmt_word">And if a man purchase of the Levites,</span> for the word rendered <span class="accented">purchase</span> menus elsewhere <span class="accented">redeem</span>; but here the Authorized Version would seem to be correct. The sense that it gives is that if any one bought a house of the Levites, he had to render it back in the year of jubilee, just as though it had been land. On the other hand, the land belonging to the Levites, in the suburbs of the Levitical cities, which was used for the pasturage of the flocks of the Levites, could not be sold except to a Levite, and therefore no question between the Levites and members of the other tribes could arise regarding it. The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">the house that was sold, and the city of his possession,</span> must be understood, by a hendiadys, to mean, <span class="accented">the house that was sold in the city of his possession</span> (see Gesenius, 'Lex.,' s.v. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> i.b.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:23-34 If the land were not redeemed before the year of jubilee, it then returned to him that sold or mortgaged it. This was a figure of the free grace of God in Christ; by which, and not by any price or merit of our own, we are restored to the favour of God. Houses in walled cities were more the fruits of their own industry than land in the country, which was the direct gift of God's bounty; therefore if a man sold a house in a city, he might redeem it only within a year after the sale. This encouraged strangers and proselytes to come and settle among them.</body></html>
