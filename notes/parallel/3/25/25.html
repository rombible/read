This will account for the horror which Naboth expressed to Ahab of selling his patrimony: "The Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-3.htm" title="And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.">1Kings 21:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">then his nearest kinsman shall come and redeem. </span>If he has thus been compelled by pressure of poverty to sell part of his land, then it is the duty of the nearest relation, or, as the original literally denotes, "the redeemer that is nearest to him," to redeem the property which his impoverished relative has been obliged to sell. The expression "redeemer" is applied in Hebrew to one who, by virtue of being the nearest of kin, had not only to redeem the patrimony of the family, but to marry the childless widow of his brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-13.htm" title="Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives: lie down until the morning.">Ruth 3:13</a>), and avenge the blood of his relative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/35-19.htm" title="The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meets him, he shall slay him.">Numbers 35:19-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/19-6.htm" title="Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.">Deuteronomy 19:6-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-28.</span> - The right of redemption of land sold continued always alive, and might be exercised by the original owner or his kinsman. If not exercised, the owner returned into his possession at any rate in the jubilee year. If a man had to sell his land, he was bound to offer it to his nearest kinsman first (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7, 8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:23-34 If the land were not redeemed before the year of jubilee, it then returned to him that sold or mortgaged it. This was a figure of the free grace of God in Christ; by which, and not by any price or merit of our own, we are restored to the favour of God. Houses in walled cities were more the fruits of their own industry than land in the country, which was the direct gift of God's bounty; therefore if a man sold a house in a city, he might redeem it only within a year after the sale. This encouraged strangers and proselytes to come and settle among them.</body></html>
