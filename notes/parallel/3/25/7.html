(For the enactment which enjoins the remission of debts in the sabbatical year, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/15-1.htm" title="At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.">Deuteronomy 15:1-3</a>.) During the second Temple the sabbatical year began on the first day of the month of Tishri, which was the beginning of the civil year. The tillage, however, and the cultivation of certain fields and gardens, were left off in the sixth year. The cultivation of corn-fields ceased from the Feast of Passover, and orchards from Pentecost of the sixth year. The reading of portions of the Law which is enjoined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>, was assigned during the second Temple to the king. At the termination of the seventh fallow year, which coincided with the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles of the eighth year, a wooden platform was erected in the outer court of the Temple, on which the king was seated. The chief of the synagogue took the Book of the Law, and gave it to the head of the synagogue, who gave it to the head of the priests. He gave it to the high priest, and the latter handed it to the king, who stood up to receive it. He then sat down again, and read the following seven sections :--(1) <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-3.htm" title="Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>; (2) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/6-4.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:">Deuteronomy 6:4-8</a>; (3) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/11-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,">Deuteronomy 11:13-22</a>; (4) <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm" title="You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed, that the field brings forth year by year.">Deuteronomy 14:22</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-23.htm" title="Only you shall not eat the blood thereof; you shall pour it on the ground as water.">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>; (5) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/16-12.htm" title="And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.">Deuteronomy 16:12-19</a>; (6) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/17-14.htm" title="When you are come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>; (7) <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-1.htm" title="And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.">Deuteronomy 27:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-68.htm" title="And the LORD shall bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spoke to you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall be sold to your enemies for slaves and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.">Deuteronomy 28:68</a>. The king concluded with the same benedictions, which the high priest pronounced (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-27.htm" title="And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.">Leviticus 16:27</a>), only that he substituted the blessing for the festival for the absolution of sins.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 All labour was to cease in the seventh year, as much as daily labour on the seventh day. These statues tell us to beware of covetousness, for a man's life consists not in the abundance of his possessions. We are to exercise willing dependence on God's providence for our support; to consider ourselves the Lord's tenants or stewards, and to use our possessions accordingly. This year of rest typified the spiritual rest which all believers enter into through Christ. Through Him we are eased of the burden of wordly care and labour, both being sanctified and sweetened to us; and we are enabled and encouraged to live by faith.</body></html>
