Palestine was God's land: he divided it once for all in the time of Joshua among his people, and every fifty years he required that recourse should be had to that original division, in order that in each generation the people might feel themselves to be his tenants, not independent owners, <span class="accented">possessores</span>, not <span class="accented">domini.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:23-34 If the land were not redeemed before the year of jubilee, it then returned to him that sold or mortgaged it.

This encouraged strangers and proselytes to come and settle among them.</body></html>
