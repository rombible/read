Hence as new year was with the Hebrews the preparation for the Day of Atonement, so it also became the prelude to the acts of mercy which finally came into operation on the Day of Atonement. They therefore began counting the cycle of the jubile from the first of Tishri, or new year, though they proclaimed it on the tenth, or on the close of the Day of Atonement. In accordance with this the authorities during the second Temple record that "from the Feast of Trumpets <span class= "ital">[i.e., </span>Tishri 1] till the Day of Atonement <span class= "ital">[i.e., </span>Tishri 10], the slaves were neither manumitted to return to their homes, nor were made use of by their masters, but ate, drank, rejoiced, and wore garlands; and when the Day of Atonement came the judges blew the cornet, the slaves were manumitted to return to their homes, and the fields were set free."<p><span class= "bld">And proclaim liberty . . . unto all the inhabitants</span>--That is, to all the Israelites, who are the true possessors of the land. Hence the ancient authorities conclude that the law of jubile was only in force as long as the whole Jewish nation dwelt in the land, but not after the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, were carried into captivity by Pul and Tilgath-Pilneser kings of Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm" title="And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.">1Chronicles 5:26</a>), because "all the inhabitants" of the land dwelt no longer in it. It is from this declaration to proclaim liberty that the year of jubile is also called "the year of freedom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-17.htm" title="But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.">Ezekiel 46:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">It shall be a jubile.</span>--This is an abbreviation of the fuller form, "a year of jubile," used in the other passages of this chapter (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm" title="In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.">Leviticus 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-28.htm" title="But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.">Leviticus 25:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-40.htm" title="But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with you, and shall serve you to the year of jubilee.">Leviticus 25:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-50.htm" title="And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.">Leviticus 25:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-52.htm" title="And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.">Leviticus 25:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-54.htm" title="And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him.">Leviticus 25:54</a>), and denotes "a year proclaimed by the blast of the horn," since the word <span class= "ital">yobel </span>signifies both ram's horn and the sound emitted from it.<p><span class= "bld">And ye shall return every man.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-14.htm" title="And if you sell ought to your neighbor, or buy ought of your neighbor's hand, you shall not oppress one another:">Leviticus 25:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-23.htm" title="The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for you are strangers and sojourners with me.">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Every man unto his family.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - This verse contains a short statement of the two purposes of the jubilee: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">to proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye shall return every man unto his possession.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:8-22 The word jubilee signifies a peculiarly animated sound of the silver trumpets. This sound was to be made on the evening of the great day of atonement; for the proclamation of gospel liberty and salvation results from the sacrifice of the Redeemer. It was provided that the lands should not be sold away from their families. They could only be disposed of, as it were, by leases till the year of jubilee, and then returned to the owner or his heir. This tended to preserve their tribes and families distinct, till the coming of the Messiah. The liberty every man was born to, if sold or forfeited, should return at the year of jubilee. This was typical of redemption by Christ from the slavery of sin and Satan, and of being brought again to the liberty of the children of God. All bargains ought to be made by this rule, Ye shall not oppress one another, not take advantage of one another's ignorance or necessity, but thou shalt fear thy God. The fear of God reigning in the heart, would restrain from doing wrong to our neighbour in word or deed. Assurance was given that they should be great gainers, by observing these years of rest. If we are careful to do our duty, we may trust God with our comfort. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all neither sowed or reaped. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all God's people, in all ages, to trust him in the way of duty. There is nothing lost by faith and self-denial in obedience. Some asked, What shall we eat the seventh year? Thus many Christians anticipate evils, questioning what they shall do, and fearing to proceed in the way of duty. But we have no right to anticipate evils, so as to distress ourselves about them. To carnal minds we may appear to act absurdly, but the path of duty is ever the path of safety.</body></html>
