(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm" title="And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.">Leviticus 19:23</a>.) This is the fourth instance in Leviticus of a law being given prospectively which had no immediate bearing on the condition of Israel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-34.htm" title="When you be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;">Leviticus 14:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm" title="And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.">Leviticus 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:">Leviticus 23:10</a>.) According to the authorities during the second Temple this law came into operation in the twenty-first year after the Israelites entered Canaan. As the conquest of the promised land occupied them seven years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-10.htm" title="And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, see, I am this day fourscore and five years old.">Joshua 14:10</a>), and as the division of it between the different tribes took seven years more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm" title="And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.">Joshua 18:1</a>, &c.), the real cultivation of the land only began at the end of the second seven years. Hence the first seventh year in which laws of the sabbatical year came into operation was the twenty-first year after their entrance into Canaan.<p><span class= "bld">Then shall the land keep a sabbath.</span>--For which the marginal rendering is "rest," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a sabbath. For the import of this phrase see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-32.htm" title="It shall be to you a sabbath of rest, and you shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even to even, shall you celebrate your sabbath.">Leviticus 23:32</a>. The septennial sabbath is to be to the land what the weekly sabbath is to the whole earth. Just as the seventh day is dedicated to God in recognition of His being the Creator of the world, so the seventh year is to be consecrated to Him in acknowledgment that He is the owner of the land. Hence, like the weekly sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm" title="But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm" title="Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; you shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm" title="But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your ox, nor your ass, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates; that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you.">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>), the seventh year sabbath is belonging "unto the Lord." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-4.htm" title="But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.">Leviticus 25:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-7.</span> - The sabbath of the seventh year could only be observed <span class="cmt_word">when ye come into the land which I give you.</span> The habit of making no distraction in the seventh year during the whole of the life in the wilderness may have led to the neglect of the law after the settlement in Canaan. Another excuse for the neglect may have been a difficulty which would have presented itself of fixing the date from which to count up to the seventh year, as different parts of the land were conquered at different times. According to the law, from New Year's Day of the seventh year (the 1st of Tisri, which occurred about the middle of September) to the following New Year's Day, there was to be neither sowing nor pruning, reaping or gathering. The expression, <span class="cmt_word">Neither shalt thou gather the grapes of thy vine undressed,</span> would be more literally rendered, <span class="accented">the grapes of thy Nazarite vine</span>, the vine with its unpruned tendrils, being likened to the Nazarite with his unshorn locks. As to sowing and reaping, an exception was made with respect to the barley sown and reaped for the Passover sheaf, and the wheat sown and reaped for the Pentecost loaves. The spontaneous fruits of the earth, and they were very large in the rich fields of the valleys and plains, were to be the property of all alike, whether the owners of the land or not, "that the poor of thy people might eat" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>). And what was left by man was to be food for the cattle and beasts of the field. The cessation of agricultural labours must have served, and may have been intended to serve, as an encouragement to mercantile pursuits, as well as to the study of the Divine Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>). The Feast of Tabernacles of the seventh year was specially appointed by Moses as a day for reading the Law to the assembled people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>). And the Mishna appoints the following passages of Deuteronomy to be read on that day: - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27, 28</a>. ('Mish. Sotah.,' 7:8). The other ordinance connected with the sabbatical year, the release of debts to the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-1.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1-6</a>), was, like the fifth commandment, made of none effect by rabbinical traditions - notably by one which required a debtor, when his creditor said, "I remit," to insist that nevertheless he should accept payment. The moral purpose of the sabbath of the seventh year is well drawn out by Keil: - "In the sabbatical year the land which the Lord had given his people was to observe a period of holy rest and refreshment to its Lord and God, just as the congregation did on the sabbath day; and the hand of man was to be withheld from the fields and fruit gardens from working them that they might yield their produce for his use. The earth was to be sacred from the hand of man, exhausting its power for earthly purposes as his own property, and to enjoy the holy rest with which God had blessed the earth and all its productions after the Creation. From this, Israel, as the nation of God, was to learn, on the one hand, that although the earth was created for man, it was not merely created for him to draw out its power for his own use, but also to be holy to the Lord and participate in the blessed rest; and on the other hand, that the great purpose for which the congregation of the Lord existed did not consist in the uninterrupted tilling of the earth, connected with bitter labour in the sweat of the brow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17, 19</a>), but in the peaceful enjoyment of the fruits of the earth, which the Lord their God had given them and would give them still, without the labour of their hands, if they strove to keep his covenant and satisfy themselves with his grace." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 All labour was to cease in the seventh year, as much as daily labour on the seventh day. These statues tell us to beware of covetousness, for a man's life consists not in the abundance of his possessions. We are to exercise willing dependence on God's providence for our support; to consider ourselves the Lord's tenants or stewards, and to use our possessions accordingly. This year of rest typified the spiritual rest which all believers enter into through Christ. Through Him we are eased of the burden of wordly care and labour, both being sanctified and sweetened to us; and we are enabled and encouraged to live by faith.</body></html>
