To the same effect were the laws of inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/27-6.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 27:6-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/36-5.htm" title="And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph has said well.">Numbers 36:5-13</a>).

This encouraged strangers and proselytes to come and settle among them.</body></html>
