According to the rules which obtained during the second Temple, it must be over thirty-one days in the second year of its age. It was of greater value than the female sheep. The sacrifice for a trespass in holy things, though ignorantly committed, was therefore more costly than for the sin of ignorance mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-6.htm" title="And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.">Leviticus 5:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">With thy estimation by shekels of silver.</span>--That is, according to the valuation of Moses, to whom this was primarily addressed, the ram is to be so grown up as to be worth several, or at least two shekels. The act of valuing was transferred by Moses to the officiating priests. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-8.htm" title="But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.">Leviticus 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-12.htm" title="And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you value it, who are the priest, so shall it be.">Leviticus 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-16.htm" title="And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.">Numbers 18:16</a>.) For the shekels of the sanctuary see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm" title="This they shall give, every one that passes among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.">Exodus 30:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16</span> refer to sins of omission, offenses <span class="cmt_word">in the holy things of the Lord</span>; that is, withholding tithes and offerings. The non-payment of tithes and offerings was looked upon as robbing Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a>), and therefore it is that a trespass offering, involving compensation, and not only a sin offering, is required to atone for the offense. The ram that is to be offered is to be of a value fixed by the priest (<span class="cmt_word">with thy estimation</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the estimation of the priest), and the priest is to estimate it <span class="cmt_word">by shekels of silver</span>; implying that its value must amount at least to <span class="accented">shekels</span> (in the plural), meaning two shekels (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, where "portions" means "more than one portion," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "two portions"). The shekel is considered to be equal to 2s. 7d. The <span class="cmt_word">shekel of the sanctuary</span> means the shekel according to its exact weight and value, while still unworn by traffic and daily use. Beside offering the rain, he is to <span class="cmt_word">make amends for the harm</span> (or rather <span class="accented">sin</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that he hath clone in the holy thing, and.. . add the fifth part.</span> The fifth part is probably appointed as being the same as two-tenths of the principal sum. Full satisfaction is the marked feature of the trespass offering. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>, "Zacchaeus stood, and said,... Behold, Lord,... if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore fourfold." He went far beyond his legal obligation in respect to compensation. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-6.htm">2 Samuel 12:6</a>, "He shall restore the lamb fourfold.") <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:14-19 Here are offerings to atone for trespasses against a neighbour. If a man put to his own use unwittingly, any thing dedicated to God, he was to bring this sacrifice. We are to be jealous over ourselves, to ask pardon for the sin, and make satisfaction for the wrong, which we do but suspect ourselves guilty of. The law of God is so very broad, the occasions of sin in this guilty of. The law of God is so very broad, the occasions of sin in this world are so numerous, and we are so prone to evil, that we need to fear always, and to pray always, that we may be kept from sin. Also we should look before us at every step. The true Christian daily pleads guilty before God, and seeks forgiveness through the blood of Christ. And the gospel salvation is so free, that the poorest is not shut out; and so full, that the most burdened conscience may find relief from it. Yet the evil of sin is so displayed as to cause every pardoned sinner to abhor and dread it.</body></html>
