Hence, the remark of the Apostle, "And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron; so also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest, but he that said. unto him," &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-4.htm" title="And no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.">Hebrews 5:4-5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Make atonement for thyself and the people.</span>--The fact that these sacrifices which the high priest is to bring are here described as designed to make atonement for himself and the people, goes far to confirm the ancient interpretation that reference is here made to the particular sin which Aaron and the people committed in common, and that it is the sin of the golden calf (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-2.htm" title="And he said to Aaron, Take you a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.">Leviticus 9:2</a>), which is so emphatically described in the words "they made the calf which Aaron made" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-35.htm" title="And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.">Exodus 32:35</a>). Hence, whilst their share of the sin is to be atoned by a special sacrifice (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-15.htm" title="And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.">Leviticus 9:15</a>), they are yet to participate in the atoning virtue of Aaron's sacrifice because they prevailed on him to make the calf (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-1.htm" title="And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.">Exodus 32:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make an atonement for thyself, and for the people.</span> By means of the sin offering for the high priest, whose sin brought guilt both on himself and upon the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). After he had (symbolically) purified himself and them of <span class="accented">this</span> guilt, he was to <span class="cmt_word">offer the offering of the people,</span> which should purify them from the guilt contrasted by their own sins, <span class="cmt_word">and make an atonement for them</span>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-21 These many sacrifices, which were all done away by the death of Christ, teach us that our best services need washing in his blood, and that the guilt of our best sacrifices needs to be done away by one more pure and more noble than they. Let us be thankful that we have such a High Priest. The priests had not a day's respite from service allowed. God's spiritual priests have constant work, which the duty of every day requires; they that would give up their account with joy, must redeem time. The glory of God appeared in the sight of the people, and owned what they had done. We are not now to expect such appearances, but God draws nigh to those who draw nigh to him, and the offerings of faith are acceptable to him; though the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of the acceptance are spiritual likewise. When Aaron had done all that was to be done about the sacrifices, he lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them. Aaron could but crave a blessing, God alone can command it.</body></html>
