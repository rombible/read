So you shall put the evil away from among you.">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>), the administrators of the law during the second Temple decreed the following mode of carrying out the sentence. On his way from the court of justice to the place of execution a herald preceded the criminal, exclaiming, "So-and-so is being led out to be stoned for this and this crime, and so-and-so are the witnesses; if any one has to say anything that might save him, let him come forward and say it." Within ten yards of the place of execution he was publicly admonished to confess his sins, within four yards he was stripped naked except a slight covering about his loins. After his hands had been bound, he was led upon a scaffolding about twice the height of a man. Here wine mingled with myrrh was mercifully given him to dull the pain of execution, and from here one of the witnesses pushed him down with great violence so that he fell upon his back. If the fall did not kill him, the other witness dashed a great stone on his breast, and if this did not kill him, all the people that stood by covered him with stones. The corpse was then nailed to the cross, and afterwards burnt. Hereupon the relatives visited both the judges and the witnesses to show that they bore no hatred towards them, and that the sentence was just. Not unfrequently, however, the excited multitude resorted to lapidation when they wished to inflict summary justice. This description will explain why the Jews said to Christ that the woman had to be stoned, and why He replied to her accusers that he who is without sin should cast the first stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm" title="Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?">John 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-7.htm" title="So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.">John 8:7</a>); why the Jews wanted to stone Christ when they thought He was blaspheming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31</a>), and why they offered Him wine mingled with myrrh before his crucifixion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm" title="They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.">Matthew 27:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-38.htm" title="Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.">Matthew 27:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-23.htm" title="And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.">Mark 15:23</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - The close connection between <span class="cmt_word">giving of his seed unto Molech</span> and <span class="cmt_word">defiling my sanctuary</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">profaning my holy name</span>, is explained and illustrated by Ezekiel in the judgment on Aholah and Aholibah. "They have caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them. Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37-39</a>). Not only was the juxtaposition and combination of the worship of Molech and Jehovah an offense to him whose name is Jealous, but at the time that Molech-worship was carried on in the valley of Hinnom, idols were set up in the court of the temple itself, as we learn from the Book of Kings and from Jeremiah. "But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my Name, to defile it. And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which! commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34, 35</a>). And of Manasseh it is related, "He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said, In Jerusalem will I put my Name. And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. And he made his son pass through the fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-9 Are we shocked at the unnatural cruelty of the ancient idolaters in sacrificing their children? We may justly be so. But are there not very many parents, who, by bad teaching and wicked examples, and by the mysteries of iniquity which they show their children, devote them to the service of Satan, and forward their everlasting ruin, in a manner even more to be lamented? What an account must such parents render to God, and what a meeting will they have with their children at the day of judgment! On the other hand, let children remember that he who cursed father or mother was surely put to death. This law Christ confirmed. Laws which were made before are repeated, and penalties annexed to them. If men will not avoid evil practices, because the law has made these practices sin, and it is right that we go on that principle, surely they should avoid them when the law has made them death, from a principle of self-preservation. In the midst of these laws comes in a general charge, Sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy. It is the Lord that sanctifies, and his work will be done, though it be difficult. Yet his grace is so far from doing away our endeavours, that it strongly encourages them. Work out your salvation, for it is God that worketh in you.</body></html>
