Though the second and third only are here mentioned, there can hardly be any doubt that all the four garments were meant, and that the third and fourth are either omitted for the sake of brevity, or because they are included in the first term, which is the reason why some of the ancient versions have it in the plural.<p><span class= "bld">Take up the ashes which the fire had consumed with the burnt offering.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">take up the ashes into which the fire had consumed the burnt offering. </span>That is, the ashes into which the consuming fire had converted the victim.<p><span class= "bld">He shall put them beside the altar.</span>--During the second Temple, a priest was appointed by lot to take off from the altar every morning at least <span class= "bld">a </span>shovelful of ashes and carry it without the camp, and when the ashes accumulated they were entirely removed to the same place.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-13 The daily sacrifice of a lamb is chiefly referred to.
