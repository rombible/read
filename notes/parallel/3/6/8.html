Hitherto the law pointed out to the people under what circumstances and how they are to bring their sacred oblations, now directions are given to the priests how to conduct the sacrificial service of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-13.</span> - (See note on Leviticus 1:3.) The further ritual of the burnt offering is exhibited in the particular instance of the lamb sacrificed every evening (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-33.htm">Exodus 29:33</a>). In other cases the ritual was to be the same. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning,</span> the reading should be, <span class="accented">It, the burnt offering</span> (viz. the evening sacrifice), <span class="accented">shall burn upon the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning.</span> The priest is to wear his priestly dress already appointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>) - which was a white linen garment, covering the whole person like a close-fitting English surplice, fastened by a sash - while he is actually officiating at the altar; and thus vested, he is to remove from the altar <span class="cmt_word">the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering,</span> or rather, as it would be better translated, <span class="accented">the ashes to which the fire hath reduced the burnt offering</span>, and put them beside the altar, that is, on the ash-heap to the east of the altar. On leaving the court of the tabernacle, he is to change his dress, and to carry the ashes of the sacrifice <span class="cmt_word">without the camp unto a clean place</span>. The priest is also instructed to lay fresh wood on the altar fire every morning, in preparation for the morning sacrifice of the lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>). The fat of the peace offerings, that is, the parts of the peace offerings that were burnt on the altar, were laid on the burnt offering. The altar fire was never to go out, because the daily sacrifices constantly burning on the altar symbolized the unceasing worship of God by Israel, and the gracious acceptance of Israel by God. The ever-burning sacrifice was the token of the people being in communion with God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-13 The daily sacrifice of a lamb is chiefly referred to. The priest must take care of the fire upon the altar. The first fire upon the altar came from heaven, ch. 9:24; by keeping that up continually, all their sacrifices might be said to be consumed with the fire from heaven, in token of God's acceptance. Thus should the fire of our holy affections, the exercise of our faith and love, of prayer and praise, be without ceasing.</body></html>
