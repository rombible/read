that is, of the high priest and of every common priest. The ordinary priest, however, only offered it once on the day of his consecration, whilst the high priest was bound to offer it every day after the regular holocaust, with its meat offering and before the drink offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/45-14.htm" title="Their sacrifices shall be wholly consumed every day twice continually.">Ecclesiasticus 45:14</a>, with Josephus, <span class= "ital">Antiq. </span>III. 10 ? 7). It is to this practice that the apostle refers when he says, "For such a high priest became us . . . who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins, &c." (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In the day when he is anointed.</span>--That is, when he is anointed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a>) or when his anointing ceremony is completed, and he entered upon the duties of his office, which was on the eighth day. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-35.htm" title="Therefore shall you abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that you die not: for so I am commanded.">Leviticus 8:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;">Leviticus 9:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A meat offering perpetual.</span>--That is, in the case of the high priest this oblation is to be offered every day as long as he lived or held the pontifical office. This perpetual meat offering is to consist of a tenth part of an ephah, which is an omer, half of which he is to offer in the morning and half in the evening.<p><span class= "bld">In a pan it shall be made.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">upon a flat plate. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-5.htm" title="And if your oblation be a meat offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.">Leviticus 2:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And when it is baken thou shalt bring it in.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">thou shalt bring it well soaked. </span>That is, thoroughly saturated with oil.<p><span class= "bld">And the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer.</span>--That is, a meat offering consisted of small roasted cakes. After the flour was put into the pan, and was soaked in oil, it was divided into and baked in small pieces, apparently to represent the limbs into which the victim of the burnt offering was divided before it was burnt. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-8.htm" title="And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:">Leviticus 1:8</a>.) During the second Temple the following practice obtained. The high priest brought the whole tenth part of flour every morning. After sanctifying the whole, he divided it into halves with the measure kept in the sanctuary. He likewise brought three logs of oil, which he mingled with the flour, and kneaded six cakes of each half. After baking the cakes a little, he fried them upon the pan with some of the oil, taking care not to bake them too much, but that they should be between baked and raw, in accordance with the expression, <span class= "ital">tuphinei, </span>which the authorities of those days explained in this manner but which is rendered here in the Authorised Version by <span class= "ital">baked, </span>and by us <span class= "ital">roasted cakes. </span>Hereupon the high priest divided the six cakes into twelve cakes being the same number as those of the shewbread, and offered six subdivided in two in the morning and six in the evening.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:14-23 The law of the burnt-offerings put upon the priests a great deal of care and work; the flesh was wholly burnt, and the priests had nothing but the skin. But most of the meat-offering was their own. It is God's will that his ministers should be provided with what is needful.</body></html>
