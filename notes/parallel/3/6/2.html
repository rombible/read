As fraud and plunder are most subversive of social life, a crime of this sort is described as an insult to God, who is the founder and sovereign ruler of his people.<p><span class= "bld">In that which was delivered him to keep.</span>--To deposit valuable property with a neighbour was, and still is, a common practice in the East where no responsible establishments exist for the reception of private treasure. Hence, when a man went on a journey, he concealed his precious things underground. This was connected with the danger of forgetting the spot where they were hidden, when search and digging had to be resorted to. This not only accounts for the fact that treasure is called in Hebrew by a name which denotes <span class= "ital">hidden, </span>or things which men are in the habit of hiding underground, but explains such allusions as "hidden riches of secret places" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-3.htm" title="And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, the LORD, which call you by your name, am the God of Israel.">Isaiah 45:3</a>), "and searchest for her as for hid treasure" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-4.htm" title="If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;">Proverbs 2:4</a>), "dig for it more than for hid treasure" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-21.htm" title="Which long for death, but it comes not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;">Job 3:21</a>). To avoid this danger, men entrusted their treasure to the custody of a neighbour. It is to this practice which the text before us refers, and it is from this practice that the apostle took the expression when he declares, "I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2Timothy 1:12</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-14.htm" title="And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.">Leviticus 6:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:">1Timothy 6:20</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Or in fellowship.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">or in something that is placed in the hand; </span>that is, put in his hand, a deposit. It is similar in nature to the trust mentioned in the preceding clause, for which reason it is not repeated in the general recapitulation of the offences in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/6-4.htm" title="Then it shall be, because he has sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he has deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,">Leviticus 6:4-5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Or in a thing taken away in violence.</span>--Having specified two cases of embezzlement in connection with things voluntarily handed over to the defrauder, two other frauds are adduced, in which the offender possessed himself of his neighbour's property by violence and extortion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse would be better translated as follows: - <span class="cmt_word">If a soul sin,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and commit a trespass against the Lord, and falsely deny to his neighbour something that was delivered to him to keep, or something that he had received in pawn, or something that he had taken away by violence, or hath got something by oppression from his neighbour.</span> Cf. the injunction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-11.htm">Leviticus 19:11</a>: "Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another." <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7-13</a> contains earlier legislation on the subject of things taken in trust. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Though all the instances relate to our neighbour, yet it is called a trespass against the Lord. Though the person injured be mean, and even despicable, yet the injury reflects upon that God who has made the command of loving our neighbour next to that of loving himself. Human laws make a difference as to punishments; but all methods of doing wrong to others, are alike violations of the Divine law, even keeping what is found, when the owner can be discovered. Frauds are generally accompanied with lies, often with false oaths. If the offender would escape the vengeance of God, he must make ample restitution, according to his power, and seek forgiveness by faith in that one Offering which taketh away the sin of the world. The trespasses here mentioned, still are trespasses against the law of Christ, which insists as much upon justice and truth, as the law of nature, or the law of Moses.</body></html>
