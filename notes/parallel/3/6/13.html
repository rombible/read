During the second Temple, this perpetual fire consisted <span class= "bld">of </span>three parts or separate piles of wood on the same altar: on the largest one the daily sacrifice was burnt; the second, which was called the pile of incense, supplied the fire for the censers to burn the morning and evening incense; and the third was the perpetual fire from which the other two portions were fed. It never was quenched till the destruction of the Temple by Nebuchadnezzar. Indeed, we are positively assured that the pious priests who were carried captives into Persia concealed it in a pit, where it remained till the time of Nehemiah, when it was restored to the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/1-19.htm" title="For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests that were then devout took the fire of the altar privily, and hid it in an hollow place of a pit without water, where they kept it sure, so that the place was unknown to all men.">2 Maccabees 1:19-22</a>). The authorities in the time of Christ, however, assure us that the perpetual fire was one of the five things wanting in the second Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:8-13 The daily sacrifice of a lamb is chiefly referred to. The priest must take care of the fire upon the altar. The first fire upon the altar came from heaven, ch. 9:24; by keeping that up continually, all their sacrifices might be said to be consumed with the fire from heaven, in token of God's acceptance. Thus should the fire of our holy affections, the exercise of our faith and love, of prayer and praise, be without ceasing.</body></html>
