It is repeatedly stated, in some of our best commentaries, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 6:1-7</a> form part of Leviticus 5 in the Hebrew Bible, and that our translators unfortunately adopted the division of the Septuagint, instead of following the Hebrew. Nothing can be more erroneous than this statement. The Hebrew Scriptures in manuscript have no division into chapters at all. The text is divided into sections, of which there are no less than 669 in the Pentateuch. The book of Leviticus has ninety-eight of these sections, while in our Authorised Version it has only twenty-seven chapters. The divisions into chapters, now to be found in the Hebrew Bibles, were adopted in the fourteenth century by the Jews from the Christians for polemical purposes, and the figures attached to each verse are of a still later period.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord spake.</span> The six following verses contain a separate communication from the Lord to Moses, but in continuance of the subject which began at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Though all the instances relate to our neighbour, yet it is called a trespass against the Lord. Though the person injured be mean, and even despicable, yet the injury reflects upon that God who has made the command of loving our neighbour next to that of loving himself. Human laws make a difference as to punishments; but all methods of doing wrong to others, are alike violations of the Divine law, even keeping what is found, when the owner can be discovered. Frauds are generally accompanied with lies, often with false oaths. If the offender would escape the vengeance of God, he must make ample restitution, according to his power, and seek forgiveness by faith in that one Offering which taketh away the sin of the world. The trespasses here mentioned, still are trespasses against the law of Christ, which insists as much upon justice and truth, as the law of nature, or the law of Moses.</body></html>
