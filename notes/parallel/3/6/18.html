There is, however, another view of the passage which is of equal, if not of anterior, date. That is, <span class= "ital">whoso </span>or <span class= "ital">whatsoever toucheth them shall become holy. </span>Any layman or any ordinary utensil, &c., becomes sacred by touching one of the higher order of sanctity. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-37.htm" title="Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever touches the altar shall be holy.">Exodus 29:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm" title="And you shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever touches them shall be holy.">Exodus 30:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-19.htm" title="And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.">Ezekiel 44:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm" title="Then said he to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.">Ezekiel 46:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm" title="If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?
