The Levitical law lays down regulations adapting an already existing practice for the use of the Israelitish nation; it begins, therefore, not with a command, "Thou shalt bring," but, <span class="accented">if any man of you</span> (according to custom) <span class="accented">bring.</span> Any member of the congregation might bring his voluntary offering when he would. The times at which the public offerings were to be made, and their number, are afterwards designated. <span class="cmt_word">An offering.</span> This verse is introductory to the ensuing chapters, and speaks of "offerings" in general. "Kor-ban," which is the word here used for "offering," derived from <span class="accented">karab</span>, meaning "to draw near for the sake of presentation," is the generic name including all offerings and sacrifices. It is used in speaking of animal sacrifices of various kinds, including peace offerings and sin offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a> and it is applied to vegetable offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 13</a>) and to miscellaneous offerings for the service of the tabernacle, such as wagons and oxen, silver vessels for the altar, gold, jewels, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-3.htm">Numbers 7:3, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-50.htm">Numbers 31:50</a>). It is translated by the LXX. into Greek by the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">donum</span>, and our "gift." These offerings are now distinguished into their different kinds. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1,2 The offering of sacrifices was an ordinance of true religion, from the fall of man unto the coming of Christ. But till the Israelites were in the wilderness, no very particular regulations seem to have been appointed. The general design of these laws is plain. The sacrifices typified Christ; they also shadowed out the believer's duty, character, privilege, and communion with God. There is scarcely any thing spoken of the Lord Jesus in Scripture which has not also a reference to his people. This book begins with the laws concerning sacrifices; the most ancient were the burnt-offerings, about which God here gives Moses directions. It is taken for granted that the people would be willing to bring offerings to the Lord. The very light of nature directs man, some way or other, to do honour to his Maker, as his Lord. Immediately after the fall, sacrifices were ordained.</body></html>
