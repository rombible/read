The imposition of hands upon the victim was dispensed with, both because the bird was too small for this ceremony, and because the offerer brought it in his hands to the place of sacrifice, thus conveying by this act the idea involved in the imposition of hands.<p><span class= "bld">And wring off his head.</span>--When the bird is handed to him, the priest is not to use any knife, but is to nip off its head with his nails, throw the severed head on the altar fire, and thus cause it to ascend in the sweet smelling savour. As the small quantity of blood could not be caught in a bowl, and would not suffice for throwing it or pouring it on the four walls, as was the case in the offering of quadrupeds, he pressed it out from the headless body, and let it run on the walls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priest shall bring it unto the altar</span>. The difference in the ritual for the burnt sacrifice of fowls is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the offerer is not commanded to lay his hand on the bird. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the altar is the place of maciation, instead of the space on the north side of the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That the priest slays it instead of the offerer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That the blood (owing to its smaller quantity) is pressed out against the side of the altar instead of being caught in a vessel and thrown on it. There is no essential variation here; the analogy of the sacrifice of the animal is followed so far as circumstances permit. It is not certain that the word <span class="accented">malak</span>, translated <span class="accented">wring off his head</span>, means more than <span class="accented">"make</span> an incision with the nail;" but in all probability the head was to be severed and laid on the fire separately, after the manner of the other sacrifices. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-17 Those who could not offer a bullock, were to bring a sheep or a goat; and those who were not able to do that, were accepted of God, if they brought a turtle-dove, or a pigeon. Those creatures were chosen for sacrifice which were mild, and gentle, and harmless; to show the innocence and meekness that were in Christ, and that should be in Christians. The offering of the poor was as typical of Christ's atonement as the more costly sacrifices, and expressed as fully repentance, faith, and devotedness to God. We have no excuse, if we refuse the pleasant and reasonable service now required. But we can no more offer the sacrifice of a broken heart, or of praise and thanksgiving, than an Israelite could offer a bullock or a goat, except as God hath first given to us. The more we do in the Lord's service, the greater are our obligations to him, for the will, for the ability, and opportunity. In many things God leaves us to fix what shall be spent in his service, whether of our time or our substance; yet where God's providence has put much into a man's power, scanty offerings will not be accepted, for they are not proper expressions of a willing mind. Let us be devoted in body and soul to his service, whatever he may call us to give, venture, do, or suffer for his sake.</body></html>
