At the end of the previous book we are told that when the tent of meeting was completed, the Lord showed His approbation of it by covering the outside of the edifice with a heaven-sent cloud, and by filling the inside with His glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/40-34.htm" title="Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:34-38</a>). <span class= "ital">He </span>therefore, who had filled the sanctuary with his glory now "called unto Moses," thus indicating by "And he called," which are one word in the original, the intimate connection between the two books. The ancient Jewish synagogue already pointed out the fact that this unusual phrase, "And he called unto Moses," is used as an introductory formula on the three different occasions when the Lord made a special communication to this great law-giver. Thus when the Lord first communicated to Moses that He was about to deliver the Israelites from Egypt, "He called unto him" from the burning bush (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm" title="And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.">Exodus 3:4</a>). When the Lord was about to give to Moses the Ten Commandments for the people of Israel, "He called unto him" from the top of Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-3.htm" title="And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;">Exodus 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-20.htm" title="And the LORD came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.">Exodus 19:20</a>); and now when the Lord is about to give to His chosen people, through His servant Moses, the laws by which their Divine worship is to be regulated, "He called unto him" from the tent of meeting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-1.htm" title="And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,">Leviticus 1:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the LORD called unto Moses</span>. The first word of the verse, in the original <span class="accented">Vayikra</span>, meaning "and called," has been taken as the designation of the book in the Hebrew Bible. The title Leviticon, or Leviticus, was first adopted by the LXX., to indicate that it had for its main subject the duties and functions appertaining to the chief house of the priestly tribe of Levi. The word "and" connects the third with the second book of the Pentateuch. God is spoken of in this and in the next book almost exclusively under the appellation of "the LORD" or "Jehovah," the word "Elohim" being, however, used sufficiently often to identify the two names. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>, 19:12. <span class="cmt_word">And spake unto him</span>. The manner in which God ordinarily communicated with a prophet was by "a vision" or "in a dream;" but this was not the case with Moses; "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). The Levitical code of laws, therefore, was delivered to Moses in his ordinary mental state, not in trance, or dream, or ecstasy. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> The tabernacle had just been set up by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>). It derives its name <span class="accented">of the congregation</span>, or rather <span class="accented">of meeting</span>, from being the place where God met the representatives of his people (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-42.htm">Numbers 16:42</a>). Hitherto God had spoken from the mount, now he speaks from the mercy-seat of the ark in the tabernacle. He had symbolically drawn near to his people, and the sacrificial system is now instituted as the means by which they should draw nigh to him. All the laws in the Book of Leviticus, and in the first ten chapters of the Book of Numbers, were given during the fifty days which intervened between the setting up of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>) and the departure of the children of Israel from the neighbourhood of Mount Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1,2 The offering of sacrifices was an ordinance of true religion, from the fall of man unto the coming of Christ. But till the Israelites were in the wilderness, no very particular regulations seem to have been appointed. The general design of these laws is plain. The sacrifices typified Christ; they also shadowed out the believer's duty, character, privilege, and communion with God. There is scarcely any thing spoken of the Lord Jesus in Scripture which has not also a reference to his people. This book begins with the laws concerning sacrifices; the most ancient were the burnt-offerings, about which God here gives Moses directions. It is taken for granted that the people would be willing to bring offerings to the Lord. The very light of nature directs man, some way or other, to do honour to his Maker, as his Lord. Immediately after the fall, sacrifices were ordained.</body></html>
