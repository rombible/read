This also applies to the sin and trespass offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-24.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-29.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.">Leviticus 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-33.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.">Leviticus 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-25.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.">Leviticus 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-2.htm" title="In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about on the altar.">Leviticus 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-13.htm" title="And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:">Leviticus 14:13</a>, &c.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall kill it on the side of the altar, northward before the Lord.</span> In the sacrifice of the bullock it is only "before the Lord" (verse 5). No doubt the same place is meant in both cases, but it is specified with more exactness here. On the western side of the altar was the tabernacle, on the east side the heap of ashes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-16.htm">Leviticus 1:16</a>), on the south side probably the ascent to the altar (see Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5:05, 6); on the north side, therefore, was the most convenient slaughtering place, and this is probably the reason for the injunction. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:10-17 Those who could not offer a bullock, were to bring a sheep or a goat; and those who were not able to do that, were accepted of God, if they brought a turtle-dove, or a pigeon. Those creatures were chosen for sacrifice which were mild, and gentle, and harmless; to show the innocence and meekness that were in Christ, and that should be in Christians. The offering of the poor was as typical of Christ's atonement as the more costly sacrifices, and expressed as fully repentance, faith, and devotedness to God. We have no excuse, if we refuse the pleasant and reasonable service now required. But we can no more offer the sacrifice of a broken heart, or of praise and thanksgiving, than an Israelite could offer a bullock or a goat, except as God hath first given to us. The more we do in the Lord's service, the greater are our obligations to him, for the will, for the ability, and opportunity. In many things God leaves us to fix what shall be spent in his service, whether of our time or our substance; yet where God's providence has put much into a man's power, scanty offerings will not be accepted, for they are not proper expressions of a willing mind. Let us be devoted in body and soul to his service, whatever he may call us to give, venture, do, or suffer for his sake.</body></html>
