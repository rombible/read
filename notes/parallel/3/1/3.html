First in order comes the burnt offering, which is divided into burnt offering from the beeves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/1-3.htm" title="If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>), and burnt offering from the flock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10-13</a>). The ox takes precedence because it is the more costly and more important sacrifice. It had to be without disease or blemish of any kind. To offer a defective sacrifice was an insult and a deception. Hence the exclamation of the prophet, "cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>an animal with a blemish), <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-14.htm" title="But cursed be the deceiver, which has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, said the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.">Malachi 1:14</a>. The offerer is to bring the animal to <span class= "ital">the entrance of the tent of meeting, </span>as it should be rendered, that is, to the front of the Tabernacle where the brazen altar stood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-6.htm" title="And you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.">Exodus 40:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Of his own voluntary will.</span>--The whole passage is better rendered, <span class= "ital">at the entrance of the tent of meeting shall he offer it, that he may be accepted before the Lord. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm" title="And it shall be on Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.">Exodus 28:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-5.htm" title="And if you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it at your own will.">Leviticus 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/22-19.htm" title="You shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.">Leviticus 22:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-29.htm" title="And when you will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it at your own will.">Leviticus 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-11.htm" title="And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.">Leviticus 23:11</a>.) This meaning is unmistakably set forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/22-19.htm" title="You shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.">Leviticus 22:19-21</a>, where it is explicitly declared, "ye shall offer for your acceptance a male without blemish of the beeves, of the sheep or of the goats, but whatsoever hath a blemish that ye shall not offer, for <span class= "ital">it </span>shall not be acceptable for you." It is to be remarked that the phrase "for your acceptance," or "acceptable for you," is only used in connection with burnt offerings and peace offerings, but never with sin offerings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If his offering be a burnt sacrifice.</span> The Hebrew term for "burnt sacrifice" is <span class="accented">olah</span>, meaning "that which ascends;" sometimes <span class="accented">kaleel</span> "whole offering," is found (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>); the LXX. use the word <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "whole burnt offering." The conditions to be fulfilled by an Israelite who offered a burnt sacrifice were the following: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He must offer either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a young bull without blemish, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a young ram, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a young he-goat, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> a turtle-dove, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> a young pigeon. 2. In case it were a bull, ram, or goat, he must bring it to the door of the tabernacle, that is, the entrance of the court in front of the brazen altar and of the door of the holy place, and there after or present it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> In offering it he must place his hand firmly on its head, as a ceremonial act. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> He must kill it, either himself or by the agency of a Levite. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> He must flay it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> He must divide it into separate portions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> He must wash the intestines and legs. Meantime the priests had their parts to do; they had <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To catch the blood, to carry it to the altar, and to strike the inner sides of the altar with it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To arrange the fire on the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To place upon the altar the head, and the fat, and the remainder of the animal, for consumption by the fro. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> To sprinkle or place a meat offering upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The next morning, still dressed in their priestly garments, to take the ashes off the altar, and to place them at the east of the altar (chapter 6:10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> To carry them outside the camp to a clean place, the bearer being dressed in his ordinary costume (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>). There were, therefore, four essential parts in the ritual of the burnt offering - the oblation of the victim (verses 3, 4), the immolation (verse 5), the oblation of the blood, representing the life (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), and the consumption (verse 9) - the first two to be performed by the offerer, the third by the priest, the fourth by the fire representing the action of God. The moral lesson taught by the burnt offering was the necessity of self-surrender and of devotion to God, even to the extent of yielding up life and the very tenement of life. As the offerer could not give up his own life and body and still live, the life of an animal belonging to him, and valued by him, was substituted for his own; but he knew, and by laying his hand on its head showed that he knew, that it was his own life and his very self that was represented by the animal. The mystical lessons taught to those who could grasp them were - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The doctrine of substitution or vicarious suffering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The fact that without the shedding of blood there was no acceptance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The need of One who, being very man, should be able to perform an action of perfect surrender of his will and of his life. The fulfilment of the type is found in the perfect submission of Christ as man, throughout his ministry, and especially in the Garden of Gethsemane, and in the offering made by him, as Priest and willing Victim, of his life upon the altar of the cross. the burnt offering is to be <span class="cmt_word">without blemish</span>, for had not the animal been perfect in its kind, it would not have served its moral, its mystical, or its typical purpose. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, used by the LXX. as equivalent to the Hebrew term, is applied to Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>; and St. Paul teaches that it is the purpose of God that those who are adopted in Christ should also be "holy and without blemish" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). A priest had to certify that the victim was free kern all defects. <span class="cmt_word">He shall offer it of his own voluntary will</span> should rather be translated, <span class="accented">He shall offer it for his own acceptance.</span> The animal, representing the offerer, was presented by the latter in order that he might be himself accepted by the Lord. This aspect of the offering is brought out more clearly by the <span class="accented">minchah</span>, or meat offering, which always accompanied the burnt offering. The place where the presentation took place was <span class="cmt_word">the door of the tabernacle</span>, that is, the space immediately within the eastern entrance into the court of the tabernacle, immediately facing the brazen altar, which stood before the east end of the tabernacle, where was the door or entrance which led into the holy place. "The presenting of the victim at the entrance of the tabernacle was a symbol of the free will submitting itself to the Law of the Lord" (Clarke). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>: "I beseech you that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:3-9 In the due performance of the Levitical ordinances, the mysteries of the spiritual world are represented by corresponding natural objects; and future events are exhibited in these rites. Without this, the whole will seem unmeaning ceremonies. There is in these things a type of the sufferings of the Son of God, who was to be a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world? The burning body of an animal was but a faint representation of that everlasting misery, which we all have deserved; and which our blessed Lord bore in his body and in his soul, when he died under the load of our iniquities. Observe, 1. The beast to be offered must be without blemish. This signified the strength and purity that were in Christ, and the holy life that should be in his people. 2. The owner must offer it of his own free will. What is done in religion, so as to please God, must be done by love. Christ willingly offered himself for us. 3. It must be offered at the door of the tabernacle, where the brazen altar of burnt-offerings stood, which sanctified the gift: he must offer it at the door, as one unworthy to enter, and acknowledging that a sinner can have no communion with God, but by sacrifice. 4. The offerer must put his hand upon the head of his offering, signifying thereby, his desire and hope that it might be accepted from him, to make atonement for him. 5. The sacrifice was to be killed before the Lord, in an orderly manner, and to honour God. It signified also, that in Christians the flesh must be crucified with its corrupt affections and lust. 6. The priests were to sprinkle the blood upon the altar; for the blood being the life, that was it which made atonement. This signified the pacifying and purifying of our consciences, by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ upon them by faith. 7. The beast was to be divided into several pieces, and then to be burned upon the altar. The burning of the sacrifice signified the sharp sufferings of Christ, and the devout affections with which, as a holy fire, Christians must offer up themselves, their whole spirit, soul, and body, unto God. 8. This is said to be an offering of a sweet savour. As an act of obedience to a Divine command, and a type of Christ, this was well-pleasing to God; and the spiritual sacrifices of Christians are acceptable to God, through Christ, 1Pe 2:5.</body></html>
