One chief disorder is mentioned, that of the mixed marriages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a>), which the new lawgiver evidently regarded as fatal to the purity of the Divine service, and to the design of God in separating for a season this peculiar people.<p>(1-4) The report of the abuse of mixed marriages is formally brought before Ezra.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The princes</span>--Heads of tribes, native rulers of Jerusalem, as distinguished from the satraps and governors. Zerubbabel's office had no successor; and the term princes expressed rather their eminence than their authority, which had been powerless to check the abuses they complain of.<p><span class= "bld">Doing according to their abominations.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">as it regards their abominations.</span> They are not charged with abandonment to idolatry, but with that peculiar laxity which appears in the sequel.<p><span class= "bld">The Ammonites.</span>--It is remarkable that all the ancient proscribed races are mentioned, and not the specific nations by the names of which the Samaritans were known, as if to make the case as hateful as possible. At the same time, many of these races still lingered in the neighbourhood of Judaea.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">The holy seed.</span>--The "holy nation" or "peculiar people" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a> is called the "holy seed" by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-13.htm" title="Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.">Ezra 6:13</a>), with reference to its being preserved and kept holy amidst judgments; and here the same term is used with reference to its desecration by being made common among the nations.<p><span class= "bld">The princes and rulers.</span>--The upper classes, whether priests and Levites or laymen.<p><span class= "bld">This trespass.</span>--There is no question as to the unlawfulness of these intermarriages, nor any palliation on account of necessity. The rulers report it, and Ezra receives the report as evidence that the whole purpose of God with regard to the people was, at the very outset of their new economy, in course of being defeated by the guilt of the heads of Israel. Their delinquency as such is admitted on all hands.<p>(3) I<span class= "bld"> rent my garment and my mantle.</span>--The actions of Ezra betoken his horror and grief. But both the rending of the outer and inner garment and the plucking the hair were symbolical acts, teaching their lesson to the people who witnessed, and, as we see, were deeply impressed.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Trembled.</span>--In fear of the Divine judgments.<p><span class= "bld">Transgression of those that had been carried away.</span>--The usual name of the people at this time. During their captivity, however, they had not been thus guilty. It was the aggravation of their guilt that they committed the trespass now.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When these things were done.</span> It must have been some considerable time afterwards. Ezra reached Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>), rested three days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32</a>), and on the fourth day of the same month made over the vessels to the temple authorities. It was not till the seventeenth day of the ninth month that, on Ezra's motion, the matter of the mixed marriages was taken in hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-8.htm">Ezra 10:8, 9</a>). Yet we cannot suppose that action was long delayed after the matter came to Ezra's knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">The princes</span>. The civil heads of the community, whom Ezra found at the head of affairs on his arrival, and whose authority he did not wholly supersede (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-14.htm">Ezra 10:14, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The people</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the lands.</span> The idolatrous nations inhabiting the districts adjoining Palestine: Egyptians and Amorites on the south; Moabites and Ammonites on the east; Canaanites probably towards the north and the north-west. <span class="cmt_word">Doing according to their abominations.</span> Rather, "in respect of their abominations." The complaint was not so much that the Jews had as yet actually adopted idolatrous functions, as that they did not keep themselves wholly aloof from them. The foreign wives would introduce idolatrous rites into their very houses. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-4 Many corruptions lurk out of the view of the most careful rulers. Some of the people disobeyed the express command of God, which forbade all marriages with the heathen, De 7. Disbelief of God's all-sufficiency, is at the bottom of the sorry shifts we make to help ourselves. They exposed themselves and their children to the peril of idolatry, that had ruined their church and nation. Carnal professors may make light of such connexions, and try to explain away the exhortations to be separate; but those who are best acquainted with the word of God, will treat the subject in another manner. They must forebode the worst from such unions. The evils excused, and even pleaded for; by many professors, astonish and cause regret in the true believer. All who profess to be God's people, ought to strengthen those that appear and act against vice and profaneness.</body></html>
