Reuben rent his clothes when his brothers sold Joseph to the Midianites, and Jacob did the same when he believed that Joseph was dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29, 34</a>). Job "rent his mantle" on learning the death of his sons and daughters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>); and his friends "<span class="accented">rent</span> every one his mantle when they came to mourn with him and comfort him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11, 12</a>). Rent clothes indicated that a messenger was a messenger of woe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>), or that a man had heard something that had greatly shocked him, and of which he wished to express his horror (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>). Ezra's action is of this last kind, expressive of horror more than of grief, but perhaps in some degree of grief also. <span class="cmt_word">And plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard.</span> These are somewhat unusual signs of grief among the Orientals, who were wont to shave the head in great mourning, but seldom tore the hair out by the roots. The practice is not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, excepting in the apocryphal books (1 Esdras 8:71; 2 Esdras 1:8; Apoc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-2.htm">Esther 4:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And sat down astonied.</span> Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>, where the same verb is used in the same sense. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-4 Many corruptions lurk out of the view of the most careful rulers. Some of the people disobeyed the express command of God, which forbade all marriages with the heathen, De 7. Disbelief of God's all-sufficiency, is at the bottom of the sorry shifts we make to help ourselves. They exposed themselves and their children to the peril of idolatry, that had ruined their church and nation. Carnal professors may make light of such connexions, and try to explain away the exhortations to be separate; but those who are best acquainted with the word of God, will treat the subject in another manner. They must forebode the worst from such unions. The evils excused, and even pleaded for; by many professors, astonish and cause regret in the true believer. All who profess to be God's people, ought to strengthen those that appear and act against vice and profaneness.</body></html>
