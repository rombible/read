The idea is inverted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-7.htm" title="For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you.">Isaiah 54:7</a> : "For a small moment have I forsaken thee."<p><span class= "bld">Nail in his holy place.</span>--The Temple was itself the sure nail on which all their hopes hung.<p><span class= "bld">A little reviving.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">make us a little life.</span> The present revival was but the beginning, and still by manifold tokens precarious.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">We were bondmen.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">we are bondmen.</span> In this lies the emphasis of the appeal.<p><span class= "bld">A wall.</span>--Like "the nail," a figurative expression for security. The literal wall was not yet rebuilt. This completes the description of Divine mercy: first, the people were a delivered remnant; the Temple was a sure nail for the future of religion; and their civil estate was made secure.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">After</span> <span class= "bld">this.</span>--But all was a mercy for which there had been no adequate return.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Saying.</span>--In the later Old Testament Scriptures the quotation of the earlier is often of this character, giving the substance of many passages. The same style is observable in the New Testament.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Give not your daughters.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm" title="Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take to your son.">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>, the only place where the interdict includes both daughters and sons. It is observable that the giving of daughters in marriage to heathens is not mentioned either in Ezra or in Nehemiah.<p><span class= "bld">Nor seek their peace.</span>--An evident echo of that most stern injunction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-6.htm" title="You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days for ever.">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">O Lord God of Israel, thou art righteous.</span>--The solemn invocation shows that this is a summary of the whole prayer: God's righteousness is magnified, as accompanied by the grace which had preserved them, although as only a remnant; and as such covered with their trespasses; and especially with "this" the present trespass, the guilt of which underlies all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness.</span> The time of sacrifice was the fittest time for prayer, especially for a prayer in which acknowledgment of sin was to form a large part. Sacrifice symbolized expiation; and Ezra probably felt that his supplication would be helped by the expiatory rite which was being performed at the time. He <span class="cmt_word">rent his garment and his mantle</span> a second time, as a renewed indication of sorrow, and with the view of impressing the people who "were assembled unto him" (ver. 4) the more, and stirring them up to penitence. "Segnius irritant animum demissa per aures Quam quae sunt <span class="accented">oculis subjecta fidelibus."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:5-15 The sacrifice, especially the evening sacrifice, was a type of the blessed Lamb of God, who in the evening of the world, was to take away sin by the sacrifice of himself. Ezra's address is a penitent confession of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfort of true penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God's mercy is in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one much ashamed. Holy shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow. Ezra speaks as much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement; the more we think of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful to me sinner. Ezra speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer or saddler presage of ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments, and great deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonder that he has not wearied out the Lord's patience, and brought destruction upon himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly? But though the true penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf, the heavenly Advocate pleads most powerfully for him.</body></html>
