The "seed of Israel," however much it polluted itself by transgressions, was still "holy" by profession, by call, by obligation, by prophetic announcement. They were "a kingdom of priests, a holy nation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>); bound to be "separated from all the people that were on the face of the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-16.htm">Exodus 33:16</a>), and to keep themselves a "peculiar people." When they <span class="cmt_word">mingled themselves with the people of the</span> lands, they not only broke a positive command (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), but did their best to frustrate God's entire purpose in respect of them, and to render all that he had done for them of no effect. <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in the trespass.</span> "Princes and rulers" are here opposed to people of the middle and lower ranks. The upper classes, whether clerical or lay, had been the chief offenders (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18</a>); and compare the similar defection of Jews of the upper classes in Nehemiah's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-17.htm">Nehemiah 6:17, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4, 28</a>). EZRA'S ASTONISHMENT AND HORROR (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3, 4</a>). In Babylonia, whence Ezra had come, the inclination to intermarry with the heathen had not, it would seem, shown itself. Exiles in a foreign land naturally cling to each other under their adverse circumstances, and, moreover, being despised by those among whom they sojourn, are not readily accepted by them into social fellowship, much less into affinity and alliance. Thus the thing was to Ezra a new thing. His familiarity with the Law, and, perhaps we may add, his insight into the grounds upon which the Law upon this point was founded, caused him to view the matter as one of the gravest kind, and to feel shocked and horror-struck at what was told him respecting it. He showed his feelings with the usual openness and <span class="accented">abandon</span> of an Oriental: first rending both his outer and his inner garments, then tearing his hair and his beard, and finally" sitting down astonied," motionless and speechless, until the time of the evening sacrifice. Such a manifestation of horror and amazement was well calculated to impress and affect the sympathetic and ardent people over whom Providence had placed him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-4 Many corruptions lurk out of the view of the most careful rulers. Some of the people disobeyed the express command of God, which forbade all marriages with the heathen, De 7. Disbelief of God's all-sufficiency, is at the bottom of the sorry shifts we make to help ourselves. They exposed themselves and their children to the peril of idolatry, that had ruined their church and nation. Carnal professors may make light of such connexions, and try to explain away the exhortations to be separate; but those who are best acquainted with the word of God, will treat the subject in another manner. They must forebode the worst from such unions. The evils excused, and even pleaded for; by many professors, astonish and cause regret in the true believer. All who profess to be God's people, ought to strengthen those that appear and act against vice and profaneness.</body></html>
