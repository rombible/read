THE FIRST RETURN UNDER ZERUBBABEL.</span><p>(1-4) The decree of Cyrus: marking an epoch of very great importance, and therefore repeated almost word for word from the end of Chronicles.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The first year.</span>--Cyrus became king of Persia in B.C. 559. Twenty years afterwards he took Babylon from Belshazzar; and this first year of his rule in Babylon was his beginning as an agent in Jewish affairs and for the Kingdom of God.<p><span class= "bld">Stirred up.</span>--By a direct influence, probably through the instrumentality of Daniel. This prophet we may suppose Cyrus to have found in Babylon, and to have had his mind directed to the express prediction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where his name is mentioned. But the writer, who again and again records the prophetic intervention of Haggai and Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-1.htm" title="Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.">Ezra 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-14.htm" title="And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.">Ezra 6:14</a>), makes no allusion to the part that Daniel the earlier prophet had taken. He refers only to the Divine prediction by Jeremiah, which must be fulfilled: "And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon" ( <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, said the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.">Jeremiah 25:12</a>); "For thus saith the Lord, that after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.">Jeremiah 29:10</a>).<p>(2) <span class= "bld">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia.</span>--In the interpretation of this decree two courses are open. We may suppose that "the spirit" of Cyrus was so effectually "stirred up" by the Spirit of God, through the prophecies of Isaiah, as to send out a written proclamation avowing his faith in Jehovah-Elohim, and thus publicly accepting the prediction: <span class= "ital">"</span>He hath charged me to build." In this case the parenthesis of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-3.htm" title="Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:3</a> (He is the God) may be compared with the confession of his father-in-law, Darius the Mede: "He is the living God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-26.htm" title="I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end.">Daniel 6:26</a>). Or we may assume that "Ormazd" in the original was reproduced in the Hebrew version that accompanied it by its equivalent, <span class= "ital">"</span>Jehovah." The latter supposition avoids the difficulty involved in making Cyrus disavow the national faith in the presence of his empire. The decree itself runs much in the style of those found in the majority of Persian inscriptions, such as "By the grace of Ormazd is Darius king;" and the spirit of tolerance! and piety in it is perfectly in harmony with all ancient testimonies to the character of Cyrus.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Whosoever remaineth.</span>--<span class= "ital">As to all the Remnant in all places.</span> There is a singular correspondence between this and the beginning of Nehemiah; but there this familiar name for the survivors of the great national catastrophe is used of those who had returned to Jerusalem, while here it is used for the dispersion in all the provinces of the empire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm" title="And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.">Nehemiah 1:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Where he sojourneth.</span>--Every individual Jew is thus significantly supposed to be only an exile.<p><span class= "bld">Let the men of his place help him.</span>--The heathen subjects of Cyrus are required to assist the departing sojourner, and expected also to send freewill offerings to the Temple. Note that in all these terms the spirit and phrase of the Hebrew people are used; and that there was more in the decree than is here given, as appears in the sequel. Cyrus was under strong influence, both human and Divine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the first year of Cyrus.</span> The context shows that it is the first year of Cyrus <span class="accented">at Babylon</span> which is intended. Cyrus the Great became King of Persia by his final defeat and capture of Astyages, in <span class="date">B.C. 559</span> probably. His conquest of Babylon was, comparatively speaking, late in his reign (Herod., Xenoph.), and is fixed by the Canon of Ptolemy to <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. He took the city on the night of Belshazzar's feast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>), when Daniel had just been appointed to the third place in the kingdom (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 29), and was practically at the head of affairs. Thus the great king and the great prophet of the time were brought into contact, and naturally conferred together, as may be gathered from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1). <span class="cmt_word">That the word of the Lord by</span> <span class="cmt_word">the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled</span>. The reference is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12</a>, and Jeremiah 29:10. Jeremiah had prophesied not only the fact, but the date of the return, by assigning to the captivity a duration of "seventy years." There might be some doubt when exactly this term would run out, since the year of 360 was in prophetic use no less than the year of 365 days ('Dict. of the Bible,' s.v. YEAR), and, moreover, the exact date of the commencement of the captivity admitted of question; but Daniel appears to have calculated in <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> that the term was approaching its termination (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2-19</a>). If the captivity were regarded as commencing in the third year of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1, 2</a>), which was <span class="date">B.C. 606-605</span>, and if years of 360 days were regarded as intended, this would clearly be so, since 360 x 70 = 25,200, and 365 &times; 68 = 24,820, so that in <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> only another year was wanting. For the prophecy to be fulfilled, it was requisite that the first steps towards bringing about the return and the cessation of desolation should not be delayed beyond the close of <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span>, accordingly, in this year <span class="cmt_word">stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia</span>. As God in earlier times had worked on the minds of Abimelech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>) and Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-5.htm">Numbers 23:5, 16</a>), and more recently of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>), so now, it would seem, he directly influenced the heart and will of Cyrus. This is the less surprising, as Cyrus was, in the Divine counsels, fore-ordained to do this work, and had been raised to his high station for the purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-4</a>). Cyrus was thus induced to make a <span class="cmt_word">proclamation</span> (literally, "to make to pass a voice") throughout the whole kingdom, which reached from the AEgean Sea to the borders of India, and from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf, and even to <span class="cmt_word">put it in writing</span>, <span class="accented">b</span> <span class="accented">miktab</span>, that so it might be sure to become generally known. Writing was probably of recent introduction into Persia; but there is positive evidence in the native remains of its use by Cyrus. His proclamation was probably issued in at least two languages, Persian and Chaldee. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus. The hearts of kings are in the hand of the Lord. God governs the world by his influence on the spirits of men; whatever good they do, God stirs up their spirits to do it. It was during the captivity of the Jews, that God principally employed them as the means of calling the attention of the heathen to him. Cyrus took it for granted, that those among the Jews who were able, would offer free-will offerings for the house of God. He would also have them supplied out of his kingdom. Well-wishers to the temple should be well-doers for it.</body></html>
