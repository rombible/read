but the formula "says Darius the king," "says Xerxes the king" is frequent in them. <span class="cmt_word">King of Persia</span>. So the Behistun inscription: "I am Darius, the great king, the king of kings, <span class="accented">the king of Persia."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The Lord</span> <span class="cmt_word">God of heaven,</span> <span class="accented">Yehovah Elohey hashshamayim.</span> "God of heaven" seems to have been a usual title of the Supreme Being among the Persians (see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-9.htm">Ezra 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12, 23</a>), and perhaps designated Ormuzd in contradistinction to Ahriman, who was lord of the infernal regions. The use of the term "Jehovah," instead of Ormuzd, is remarkable, and was probably limited to the Hebrew transcript of the proclamation. <span class="cmt_word">Hath given me all</span> <span class="cmt_word">the kingdoms of the earth.</span> An acknowledgment that they have received and hold their royal power from Ormuzd is universal on the part of all the Persian kings who have left inscriptions of any length; but they do not often indulge in such a hyperbole as this of Cyrus. Artaxerxes Ochus, however, calls himself "king of this world" (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inser.,' vol. 1. p. 341). The mention of the "kingdoms of the earth" is appropriate, since Cyrus had not inherited his empire, but built it up by the conquest of a vast number of independent states ('Herod.' 1. <span class="accented">passim</span>). His earn feeling that God had in all cases given him the victory harmonizes with the statement of Isaiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">hath charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem</span>. The <span class="accented">he</span> is emphatic, and is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the Septuagint and <span class="accented">ipse</span> in the Vulgate. He himself, Jehovah-Elohim, has given it me in charge to build him a house. Most critics rightly explain by referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, and accepting the statement of Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1) that the passage was shown to Cyrus shortly after his capture of Babylon. He understood the prophecy as a command, and proceeded to obey it. <span class="cmt_word">Which is in Judah</span>. The addition of this clause marks strongly the oblivion into which the ruined city had fallen. Apparently, it was necessary, to recall its situation to men's minds by an express mention of the province whereof it had been the capital. Note the repetition of the clause in the next verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus. The hearts of kings are in the hand of the Lord. God governs the world by his influence on the spirits of men; whatever good they do, God stirs up their spirits to do it. It was during the captivity of the Jews, that God principally employed them as the means of calling the attention of the heathen to him. Cyrus took it for granted, that those among the Jews who were able, would offer free-will offerings for the house of God. He would also have them supplied out of his kingdom. Well-wishers to the temple should be well-doers for it.</body></html>
