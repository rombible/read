Gozan and Media, to which the ten tribes had been transported by the Assyrian monarchs, were within his dominions no less than Babylonia. That many non-Jewish Israelites did return appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">His God</span> <span class="cmt_word">be with</span> him. A pious wish, almost a blessing, indicative of the deep religious feeling and great goodness of heart which characterized Cyrus alone of Persian monarchs. Among the Greeks, AEschylus, who first speaks of him, calls him kindly" or "gracious" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); Herodotus says he ruled his subjects like a father; Xenophon makes him a model prince; Plutarch observes that "in wisdom and virtue and greatness of soul he excelled all other kings;" Diodorus ascribes to him a remarkable power of self-command, together with good feeling and gentleness. The Latin writers, Cicero and others, add their meed of praise; and altogether it may be said that, so far as the evidence reaches, no nobler character appears in ancient history. The Scriptural notices, whether in this book or in Isaiah, are in remarkable accord. <span class="cmt_word">Let him go up</span>. Jerusalem was on a much higher level than Babylon, and the travellers would consequently have to ascend considerably. <span class="cmt_word">And build</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house.</span> The "charge" to Cyrus did not require him to take a personal share in the building. He was simply to "say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). He is therefore content to assign the actual work to others. <span class="cmt_word">He is the God</span>. The Septuagint and the Vulgate attach the last clause of the verse to these words, and render "He is the God who is in Jerusalem," which greatly weakens the force of the expression. According to this punctuation, Cyrus makes Jehovah a mere local Deity; according to the far preferable arrangement of the A. V., he declares emphatically that Jehovah is the one true God, beside whom there is no other. Compare the very similar confession of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus. The hearts of kings are in the hand of the Lord. God governs the world by his influence on the spirits of men; whatever good they do, God stirs up their spirits to do it. It was during the captivity of the Jews, that God principally employed them as the means of calling the attention of the heathen to him. Cyrus took it for granted, that those among the Jews who were able, would offer free-will offerings for the house of God. He would also have them supplied out of his kingdom. Well-wishers to the temple should be well-doers for it.</body></html>
