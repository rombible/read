But "according to the counsel" removes all appearance of arbitrariness on the part of Ezra.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Within three days.</span>--From the time of hearing the summons. No town was more than forty miles distant; and of course only those would come that were able, and who came within the scope of the proclamation, the precise terms of which are not given. They were not more than could assemble "in the street," or open court of the Temple. The minute specifications of date, and the two reasons for the trembling of the people, and the whole strain of the narrative, bear witness to the veracity of an eye-witness.<p><span class= "bld">It was the ninth month.</span>--Chisleu, our December, the rainy month in Palestine.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">Ezra the priest.</span>--He stood up, not as the commissioner of Artaxerxes, not at this moment as the scribe, but as the representative of God.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Do his pleasure.</span>--This procedure, humanly severe, is connected with the Divine will.<p><span class= "bld">From the people of the land, and from the strange wives.</span>--The marriages were but a subordinate branch, though a very important one, of the wider sin: that of confederacy with idolators.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">We are many.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">we have greatly offended in this thing.</span> The greatness of the offence of course implied the number of the offenders.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">Stand.</span>--As a representative body in session.<p><span class= "bld">Until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.</span>--A difficult verse, owing to a slight peculiarity in the original.

But the reason is obvious enough. Some modern expositors are of their mind, and regard the act of Ezra as remedying one sin by another still greater. They bring Malachi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-15.htm" title="The children of Adin, four hundred fifty and four.">Ezra 2:15</a>) to their support; but nothing in his prediction about "the wife of thy youth," rightly understood, tends to condemn the conduct here described.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">By their names.</span>--As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-20.htm" title="Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.">Ezra 8:20</a>, the names were before the writer, but are not given.<p><span class= "bld">And sat down.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">held a session.</span> This was ten days after the general assembly.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">And they made an end.</span>--Though the number of transgressors was only one hundred and thirteen, two months were occupied, which shows the care taken to do justice, especially to the claims of the women put away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They</span> <span class="cmt_word">made proclamation.</span> Literally, "they made to pass a voice" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> - LXX.).

So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affair should be carried on. That which is hastily resolved on seldom proves lasting.</body></html>
