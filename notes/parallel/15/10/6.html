Johanan appears by <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22, 23</a>, compared with vers. 10-11, to have been really the grandson of Eliashib, who, as high priest, would have the right of assigning him a chamber in the temple (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I did eat no bread nor drink water</span>. Strict fasts of this kind had been observed by Moses twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>), and by the Ninevites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7</a>), but they were very uncommon. Usually it was considered enough to abstain from eating (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-34.htm">1 Samuel 20:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>). Sometimes the person who fasted merely abstained from "meat and wine, and <span class="accented">pleasant</span> bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>). Ezra's great earnestness appears in the severity of his fast, which (it is to be remembered) was not for his own sins, but for those of his brethren. PROCLAMATION MADE, SUMMONING ALL THE JEWS TO JERUSALEM (vers. 7- 9). After due deliberation between Ezra, the princes, and the elders (ver. 8), it was resolved, as a first step, to summon all Jews - or, rather, all those who had returned from the captivity, whether they were Jews or Israelites - to Jerusalem, in order that the decision come to with respect to the mixed marriages might be communicated to them. The limit of three days was fixed as the latest date at which any one might make his appearance, and absentees were threatened with the heavy penalties of excommunication and forfeiture of all their possessions. Proclamation having been made to this effect "throughout Judah" (ver. 7), there was a gathering of all the males of full age to Jerusalem within the prescribed time. The place of meeting was the great court of the temple (ver. 9). According to Hecataeus of Abdera (Fr. 14), this was "a stone-walled enclosure, about 500 feet long and 150 feet wide," which might perhaps afford sitting room for 20,000 men. Deducting the aged and infirm, the sick, and those between twelve and twenty years of age, the country Jews would scarcely have reached this number. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 There is hope concerning people, when they are convinced, not only that it is good to part with their sins, but that it is necessary; we must do it, or we are undone. So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affair should be carried on. That which is hastily resolved on seldom proves lasting.</body></html>
