That covenant was entered into before God, in the temple, by the princes and all the people (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 10). <span class="cmt_word">To put away all the wives</span>. Shechaniah probably held that marriages made contrary to the law were not merely wrongful, but invalid. At any rate, since the law of Moses, as interpreted by the Rabbis, allowed divorce "for every cause" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3</a>), the remedy suggested was feasible, though scarcely one which the civil power could enforce. <span class="cmt_word">And such as are born of them.</span> "Filii matrem sequuntur" was a maxim of Roman, and, apparently, also of Jewish law. Young children require especially a mother's care. Older ones might be already tainted with idolatry. It was best, Shechaniah thought, to make a clean sweep, and dismiss the children as well as the mothers. <span class="cmt_word">According to the counsel</span> of my lord. Ezra had not yet advised any course; but Shechaniah gathers from the horror which he has expressed what his wishes must be. <span class="cmt_word">Let it be done according to the law</span>. Either, "<span class="accented">Let</span> the law, which forbids these marriages, be in this way satisfied" (Dathe); or, "<span class="accented">Let</span> the repudiation of the wives take place in the mode prescribed by the law" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Shechaniah owned the national guilt. The case is sad, but it is not desperate; the disease threatening, but not incurable. Now that the people begin to lament, a spirit of repentance seems to be poured out; now there is hope that God will forgive, and have mercy. The sin that rightly troubles us, shall not ruin us. In melancholy times we must observe what makes for us, as well as against us. And there may be good hopes through grace, even where there is the sense of great guilt before God. The case is plain; what has been done amiss, must be undone again as far as possible; nothing less than this is true repentance. Sin must be put away, with a resolution never to have any thing more to do with it. What has been unjustly got, must be restored. Arise, be of good courage. Weeping, in this case, is good, but reforming is better. As to being unequally yoked with unbelievers, such marriages, it is certain, are sinful, and ought not to be made; but now they are not null, as they were before the gospel did away the separation between Jews and Gentiles.</body></html>
