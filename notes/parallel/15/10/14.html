OPPOSITION OF JONATHAN AND OTHERS (ver. 15). It was natural that some opposition should manifest itself when so trenchant a measure was announced as that which Ezra had declared to be necessary. To compel men to divorce their wives was to touch many in the tenderest place. Nor was it difficult to bring forward very plausible arguments to show that the marriages - or at any rate some of them - were allowable. Joseph had married an Egyptian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>), Moses a Midianite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>). True, these marriages had taken place before the law was given; but subsequently, also, Boaz had married Ruth the Moabitess (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>); David had taken to wife Maacah, a Geshurite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>); and Solomon had without blame married the daughter of a Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>). These examples might be pleaded in proof that the Law admitted of exceptions, and individuals might argue that their cases were of an exceptional character. Again, in some instances the foreign wives may have become proselytes, and the children may have been circumcised, and so accepted into the congregation; which would give them a claim to remain, which would extend in some degree to the mothers. We therefore cannot be surprised that an opposition was made. Rather, it is remarkable that it was so slight, only extending (so far as appears) to four persons, and so easily quelled. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 There is hope concerning people, when they are convinced, not only that it is good to part with their sins, but that it is necessary; we must do it, or we are undone. So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affair should be carried on. That which is hastily resolved on seldom proves lasting.</body></html>
