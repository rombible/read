Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/ezra/10.htm">New Living Translation</a></span><br />So this was the plan they followed. Ezra selected leaders to represent their families, designating each of the representatives by name. On December 29, the leaders sat down to investigate the matter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/ezra/10.htm">English Standard Version</a></span><br />Then the returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men, heads of fathers&#8217; houses, according to their fathers&#8217; houses, each of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/ezra/10.htm">Berean Study Bible</a></span><br />So the exiles did as proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, each of them identified by name, to represent their families. On the first day of the tenth month they convened the investigation,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/ezra/10.htm">New American Standard Bible </a></span><br />But the exiles did so. And Ezra the priest selected men who were heads of fathers' households for each of their father's households, all of them by name. So they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/ezra/10.htm">King James Bible</a></span><br />And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, <i>with</i> certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by <i>their</i> names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/csb/ezra/10.htm">Christian Standard Bible</a></span><br />The exiles did what had been proposed. The priest Ezra selected men who were family heads, all identified by name, to represent their ancestral families. They convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/cev/ezra/10.htm">Contemporary English Version</a></span><br />Everyone else who had returned from exile agreed with the plan. So Ezra the priest chose men who were heads of the families, and he listed their names. They started looking into the matter on the first day of the tenth month, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/gnt/ezra/10.htm">Good News Translation</a></span><br />The returned exiles accepted the plan, so Ezra the priest appointed men from among the heads of the clans and recorded their names. On the first day of the tenth month they began their investigation, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hcsb/ezra/10.htm">Holman Christian Standard Bible</a></span><br />The exiles did what had been proposed.

Ezra the priest and leaders of certain ancestral groups listed by name devoted themselves to examine the situation on the first day of the tenth month. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/net/ezra/10.htm">NET Bible</a></span><br />So the exiles proceeded accordingly. Ezra the priest separated out by name men who were leaders in their family groups. They sat down to consider this matter on the first day of the tenth month,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nheb/ezra/10.htm">New Heart English Bible</a></span><br />But the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest selected for himself men, heads of fathers' houses, according to their fathers' houses, and all of them by their names. So they began their sessions  on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/gwt/ezra/10.htm">GOD'S WORD&reg; Translation</a></span><br />The former exiles did this.

The people generally, notwithstanding the opposition of Jonathan, acquiesced in Ezra's decision, and acted accordingly. <span class="cmt_word">Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers.</span> There is no "with," or other connective, in the original; but our translators did right in supplying one, since the conjunction <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span>, "and," has almost certainly fallen out of the text by the mistake of a copyist. <span class="cmt_word">After</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house of their fathers.</span> Rather, "for each father's house" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "for each family." It would seem from this clause that each recognised family was represented on the commission by its head.

And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.</body></html>
