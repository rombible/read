And all the people stood to the covenant.">2Kings 23:3</a>, and in regard to particular offences, as here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-8.htm" title="This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;">Jeremiah 34:8</a>--were familiar in Jewish history.

First, it was "in the counsel of the Lord" as God's law, rightly interpreted, demanded this measure, however seemingly harsh; secondly, it was to be done "according to the law;" and, thirdly, according to the present covenant, which, went beyond the law of Moses.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">The chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib.</span>--Ezra retired for fasting and prayer into one of the chambers opening on the court. It seems impossible to identify these names with the Eliashib of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-10.htm" title="And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,">Nehemiah 12:10</a> and his grandson.

He at once "sat down astonied" (ver. 8). So he remained until preparations began to be made for the evening sacrifice, when he arose, and took up a position directly in front of the altar and the holy place, towards which he proceeded to pray. Doubtless he had in his mind the words of Solomon, assented to by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>), and pleaded by Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-9.htm">2 Chronicles 20:9</a>): "What prayer and supplication be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, <span class="accented">and spread forth his hands towards this place</span>: then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-38.htm">1 Kings 8:38, 39</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Shechaniah owned the national guilt. The case is sad, but it is not desperate; the disease threatening, but not incurable. Now that the people begin to lament, a spirit of repentance seems to be poured out; now there is hope that God will forgive, and have mercy. The sin that rightly troubles us, shall not ruin us. In melancholy times we must observe what makes for us, as well as against us. And there may be good hopes through grace, even where there is the sense of great guilt before God. The case is plain; what has been done amiss, must be undone again as far as possible; nothing less than this is true repentance. Sin must be put away, with a resolution never to have any thing more to do with it. What has been unjustly got, must be restored. Arise, be of good courage. Weeping, in this case, is good, but reforming is better. As to being unequally yoked with unbelievers, such marriages, it is certain, are sinful, and ought not to be made; but now they are not null, as they were before the gospel did away the separation between Jews and Gentiles.</body></html>
