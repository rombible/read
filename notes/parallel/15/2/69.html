This being so, the two accounts agree, always allowing that Ezra's 61,000 is a corruption of 41,000 in the gold, and his 5,000 pounds of silver and 100 priests' garments round numbers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 69.</span> - After their ability.

This was a gold coin, stamped with the figure of a Persian king, wearing his crown, and armed with a bow and arrow. According to the most exact computation, each such coin contained somewhat more pure gold than an English guinea, and was worth &pound;1 1s. 10.5d. of our money.

In Greece the silver mind was worth a little more than &pound;4 of our money. The value of the Hebrew silver <span class="accented">munch</span> is uncertain, but probably was not very different from the Greek. Thus the sum contributed in silver may be estimated at above &pound;20,000, and the entire contribution at nearly &pound;90,000. It must be noted, however, that Nehemiah's estimate (Nehemiah 7:71, 72) is less. <span class="cmt_word">One hundred priests' garments.</span> Nehemiah says ninety-seven (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 70, 72), whence we may conclude that Ezra uses a round number. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:64-70 Let none complain of the needful expenses of their religion. Seek first the kingdom of God, his favour and his glory, then will all other things be added unto them. Their offerings were nothing, compared with the offerings of the princes in David's time; yet, being according to their ability, were as acceptable to God. The Lord will carry us through all undertakings entered on according to his will, with an aim to his glory, and dependence on his assistance. Those who, at the call of the gospel, renounce sin and return to the Lord, shall be guarded and guided through all perils of the way, and arrive safely at the mansions provided in the holy city of God.</body></html>
