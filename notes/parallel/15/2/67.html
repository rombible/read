The ass (we see) is still, as in the earlier times, the chief beast of burden employed by the Israelites. Horses are rare, camels and mules still rarer; but most emigrant families had, it would seem, one ass (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-16.htm">1 Samuel 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-30.htm">1 Chronicles 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:68-70 THE OFFERINGS MADE BY THE RETURNED EXILES ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT JERUSALEM (vers. 68-70). It has been customary among the pious of all ages and countries to make thank-offerings to the Almighty on the accomplishment of any important or dangerous work. The long journey of the exiles from Babylonia to Jerusalem involved considerable risk (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22, 31</a>), and its successful termination naturally called forth their gratitude. The character of the offerings made is indicative of the fact, otherwise probable, that the exiles had turned all that they possessed into money, and had brought to Jerusalem a considerable amount of coin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:64-70 Let none complain of the needful expenses of their religion. Seek first the kingdom of God, his favour and his glory, then will all other things be added unto them. Their offerings were nothing, compared with the offerings of the princes in David's time; yet, being according to their ability, were as acceptable to God. The Lord will carry us through all undertakings entered on according to his will, with an aim to his glory, and dependence on his assistance. Those who, at the call of the gospel, renounce sin and return to the Lord, shall be guarded and guided through all perils of the way, and arrive safely at the mansions provided in the holy city of God.</body></html>
