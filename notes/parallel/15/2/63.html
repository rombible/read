They were pronounced to be excluded from priestly functions. Without ark or temple, the people had not as yet that special presence of Jehovah before which the high priest could "inquire of the Lord by Urim and Thummim." Zerubbabel might hope that this privilege would return, and thought the official purity of the priestly line of sufficient importance for such an inquiry. But the holy of holies in the new temple never had in it the ancient "tokens "; and by Urim and Thummim Jehovah was never again inquired of.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 63.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Tirshatha</span>. As "Shesh-bazzar" was the Babylonian name of Zerub-babel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-8.htm">Ezra 1:8</a>), so "the Tirshatha" seems to have been his Persian title. The word is probably a participial form from <span class="accented">tars</span> or <span class="accented">tarsa</span>, "<span class="accented">to</span> fear," and means literally "the Feared."

Zerubbabel evidently expected that the power of obtaining direct answers from God by means of the Urim and Thummim, whatever they were (see note on Exodus 28:30), which had existed in the pre-captivity Church, would be restored when the Church was re-established in its ancient home. The doubt whether the families of Habaiah and Coz (or Haccoz) belonged to the priestly class or no might then be resolved. But Zerubbabel's expectation was disappointed. The gift of Urim and Thum-mira, forfeited by disobedience, was never recovered. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:36-63 Those who undervalue their relation to the Lord in times of reproach, persecution, or distress, will have no benefit from it when it becomes honourable or profitable.
