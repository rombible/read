Consequently, among those who returned there were many masons and carpenters. These were now set to work by Zerubbabel, and received their wages in money. <span class="cmt_word">And meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre.</span> The Phoenicians, on the other hand, received their wages in kind. As Phoenicia was a narrow strip of country, and grew but little corn, it had always to depend mainly for its supplies of food on its neighbours, and generally drew the greater part from Palestine (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>). Hiram had furnished materials to Solomon for the first temple on condition of receiving wheat, barley, wine, and oil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-15.htm">2 Chronicles 2:15</a>). Zerubbabel made a similar arrangement at the present time with the Tyrians and Sidonians. <span class="cmt_word">To bring</span> <span class="cmt_word">cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa.</span> Having cut the timber in the mountains, the Phoenicians conveyed it to the coast, perhaps sometimes letting it pass down the rivers, and, collecting it on the coast into large rafts or "flotes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>), took these by sea to the roadstead of Joppa (Jaffa). Hence it was conveyed by land a distance of thirty-five miles to Jerusalem. Lebanon cedar was in great request in the East, and appears to have been cut and carried off both by the Egyptians and the Assyrians. The forests must in the ancient times have been far more extensive than at present. <span class="cmt_word">According to the grant that they had of Cyrus.</span> A special grant of Phoenician timber, made by Cyrus, seems to be intended. Though Cyrus had not conquered Phoenicia ('Herod.,' 3:34), he might regard his conquest of Babylon as involving the submission of what had for some time been a Babylonian dependency. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 3:8-13 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&sect; 3. REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE AND OPPOSITION MADE TO IT. LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE TEMPLE AND CEREMONIAL ON THE OCCASION (vers. 8-13). Seven months were occupied with preparations. The winter was past, and the spring had arrived. It was the second month, Zif, the month of "blossom," corresponding to our May - the same month in which Solomon had laid the foundation of the first temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>) - when Zerubbabel judged that the time had come for commencing the foundation of the second. The correspondence of the month was no doubt intentional, like the correspondence of the foundations of the altar (ver. 3), and was to mark that all was to be as before, that nothing was to be wantonly changed. Zerubbabel and Jeshua presided; but to Zerubbabel is assigned the chief part in the work. "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house" are the words of God himself to Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>). It was arranged that the work should commence with a religious ceremonial, natural piety here suggesting what was not recorded of the "first house," though it may have occurred and not have been put on record. The ceremonial consisted chiefly of praise, and was accompanied with sacred music, according to the pattern set by David and Solomon in their sacred processions and ceremonies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>, etc.). Their special parts in it were assigned beforehand to the priests, the Levites, and the people. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 From the proceedings of the Jews on their arrival, let us learn to begin with God, and to do what we can in the worship of God, when we cannot do what we would. They could not at once have a temple, but they would not be without an altar. Fear of danger should stir us to our duty. Have we many enemies? Then it is good to have God our Friend, and to keep up communion with him. Our fears should drive us to our knees. The sacrifices for all these solemnities were a heavy expense for so poor a company; yet besides those expressly appointed, many brought free-will offerings to the Lord. And they made preparation for the building of the temple without delay: whatever God calls us to do, we may depend upon his providence to furnish us with the needful means.</body></html>
