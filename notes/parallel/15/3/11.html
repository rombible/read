But religious shouting is less common. Still we hear of such shouting when the ark of the covenant was taken into the Israelite camp near Aphek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5</a>), and again when David solemnly brought it up from Kirjathjearim to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a>). Shouting appears also in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>) and in Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>) in connection with religion. It is always indicative of religious joy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 There was a remarkable mixture of affections upon laying the foundation of the temple. Those that only knew the misery of having no temple at all, praised the Lord with shouts of joy. To them, even this foundation seemed great. We ought to be thankful for the beginnings of mercy, though it be not yet perfect. But those who remembered the glory of the first temple, and considered how far inferior this was likely to be, wept with a loud voice. There was reason for it, and if they bewailed the sin that was the cause of this melancholy change, they did well. Yet it was wrong to cast a damp upon the common joys. They despised the day of small things, and were unthankful for the good they enjoyed. Let not the remembrance of former afflictions drown the sense of present mercies.</body></html>
