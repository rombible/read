The first house was destroyed in B.C. 588, fifty years before. The weeping of the ancients was not occasioned by any comparison as to size and grandeur, unless indeed they marked the smallness of their foundation stones. They thought chiefly of the great desolation as measured by the past; the younger peoplc thought of the new future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many... who were ancient men, that had seen the first house.</span> The old temple had not been destroyed so much as fifty years. Consequently, there would be <span class="accented">many</span> who could remember its grandeur and glory. These persons, <span class="cmt_word">when the foundation of the</span> (new) <span class="cmt_word">house was laid before their eyes, wept with</span> a loud voice. It was "the day of small things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>). The new house, in comparison with the old one, was "as nothing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-3.htm">Haggai 2:3</a>). The difference was perhaps not so much in the dimensions (see note on Ezra 6:3) as in the size and quality of the foundation-stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>), the excellence of the masonry, and the like. Solomon had employed the best workmen of one of the greatest of the Tyrian kings; Zerubbabel had only the arms of his own subjects to depend upon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 There was a remarkable mixture of affections upon laying the foundation of the temple. Those that only knew the misery of having no temple at all, praised the Lord with shouts of joy. To them, even this foundation seemed great. We ought to be thankful for the beginnings of mercy, though it be not yet perfect. But those who remembered the glory of the first temple, and considered how far inferior this was likely to be, wept with a loud voice. There was reason for it, and if they bewailed the sin that was the cause of this melancholy change, they did well. Yet it was wrong to cast a damp upon the common joys. They despised the day of small things, and were unthankful for the good they enjoyed. Let not the remembrance of former afflictions drown the sense of present mercies.</body></html>
