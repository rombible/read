As the first offerings on the altar were according to what was "written in the law of Moses, the man of God," so the musical ceremonial of this foundation is according to the precedent of David (see 1 Chronicles 6, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-25.htm" title="For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.">1Chronicles 16:25</a>). The trumpets belonged to the priests, the cymbals to the Levites, in the ancient ordinances of worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">the builders</span> (Zerubbabel and Jeshua) <span class="cmt_word">laid</span> <span class="cmt_word">the foundation of the temple, they set the priests in their apparel -</span> the rich apparel, designed "for glory and for beauty," which the law required (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-27.htm">Exodus 40:27-29</a>), and which the people had recently provided (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>). With trumpets. To blow with trumpets was always the duty of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-6.htm">Numbers 31:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-6.htm">1 Chronicles 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>), to praise God with cymbals the task of the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>, etc.), perhaps because the trumpet was regarded as the instrument of greater dignity. <span class="cmt_word">After the ordinance of David</span>. David's ordinance on the subject is first expressed briefly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>; afterwards, more fully, in vers. 17-21 of the same chapter. The musical service of Zerubbabel fell short of the "ordinance of David," since it comprised neither psalteries nor harps, which were an essential part of David's system. Apparently, the musical skill of the Levites had declined under the depressing circumstances of the captivity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 There was a remarkable mixture of affections upon laying the foundation of the temple. Those that only knew the misery of having no temple at all, praised the Lord with shouts of joy. To them, even this foundation seemed great. We ought to be thankful for the beginnings of mercy, though it be not yet perfect. But those who remembered the glory of the first temple, and considered how far inferior this was likely to be, wept with a loud voice. There was reason for it, and if they bewailed the sin that was the cause of this melancholy change, they did well. Yet it was wrong to cast a damp upon the common joys. They despised the day of small things, and were unthankful for the good they enjoyed. Let not the remembrance of former afflictions drown the sense of present mercies.</body></html>
