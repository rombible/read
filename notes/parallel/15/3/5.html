The practice was resumed of sacrificing on the great altar at any time any free-will offerings that individual Israelites might bring (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1, 2, 3</a>, etc.). Thus provision was made for all that was most essential in the ritual of religion, while the temple itself still remained unbuilt (see ver. 6). PREPARATION OF MATERIALS FOR THE REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE (ver. 7). When the restoration of religion had pro-greased thus far, the civil and ecclesiastical rulers turned their attention to that object which had been specially mentioned in the "decree of Cyrus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>), the rebuilding of the temple. And, first of all, it was necessary to collect building materials, wood and stone, which were the chief materials of the first temple, and which Cyrus had particularized in a supplementary decree (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-4.htm">Ezra 6:4</a>) as those to be employed in the construction of the second. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 From the proceedings of the Jews on their arrival, let us learn to begin with God, and to do what we can in the worship of God, when we cannot do what we would. They could not at once have a temple, but they would not be without an altar. Fear of danger should stir us to our duty. Have we many enemies? Then it is good to have God our Friend, and to keep up communion with him. Our fears should drive us to our knees. The sacrifices for all these solemnities were a heavy expense for so poor a company; yet besides those expressly appointed, many brought free-will offerings to the Lord. And they made preparation for the building of the temple without delay: whatever God calls us to do, we may depend upon his providence to furnish us with the needful means.</body></html>
