The two wings of the temple of Solomon were undoubtedly three storeys high (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>). But it is perhaps doubtful whether the word <span class="accented">nidbak</span> ever means "storey." Most commentators suppose three <span class="accented">courses</span> of stone, and then a course of timber, repeated from foundation to summit; but there is no known example of such a mode of building. The <span class="cmt_word">expences</span> were to be <span class="cmt_word">given</span> <span class="cmt_word">out of the king's</span> <span class="cmt_word">house,</span> defrayed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, out of the royal revenue; but either this intention of Cyrus was not carried out, or it was understood to apply only to the materials. Large sums were subscribed by the Jews themselves towards the building (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>), and large payments were made by them to the persons employed upon the work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-12 When God's time is come for fulfilling his gracious purposes concerning his church, he will raise up instruments to do it, from whom such good service was not expected. While our thoughts are directed to this event, we are led by Zechariah to fix our regard on a nobler, a spiritual building. The Lord Jesus Christ continues to lay one stone upon another: let us assist the great design. Difficulties delay the progress of this sacred edifice. Yet let not opposition discourage us, for in due season it will be completed to his abundant praise. He shall bring forth the head-stone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.</body></html>
