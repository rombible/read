We may assume that some of every tribe had returned with Zerubbabel, and that consequently it was possible to regard the re-established people as "Israel" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-20.htm">Nehemiah 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-13.htm">Zechariah 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-1.htm">Malachi 1:1</a>); though, since the great majority were Jews, they were more commonly spoken of as "Judah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1, 6, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-1.htm">Ezra 5:1, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-7.htm">Ezra 6:7, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-15.htm">Zechariah 8:15</a>, etc.). Zerubbabel, desirous of emphasising the nobler and grander view, made this solemn sin offering of twelve he-goats, one for each of the tribes. Ezra acted similarly when he brought the second colony (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:13-22 The gospel church, that spiritual temple, is long in the building, but it will be finished at last, when the mystical body is completed. Every believer is a living temple, building up himself in his most holy faith: much opposition is given to this work by Satan and our own corruptions. We trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses; but He that has begun the good work, will see it performed. Then spirits of just men will be made perfect. By getting their sins taken away, the Jews would free themselves from the sting of their late troubles. Their service was with joy. Let us welcome holy ordinances with joy, and serve the Lord with gladness.</body></html>
