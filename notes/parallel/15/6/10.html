The connection of this with the prayer following justifies the same translation here, and, moreover, indicates under what good instruction the decree was drawn up.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours.</span> Either incense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a>, or "sacrifices that are pleasing and acceptable" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And pray for the life of the king</span>. The Jews have always maintained the practice of praying for the civil ruler of any country in which they have had their abode. Jeremiah s exhortation to "seek the peace" of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>) was understood in this way, and the tradition has been handed down even to the present day. Under monarchs so favour-able to them as the Achaemenian Persians the duty would certainly not have been neglected. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">of his sons.</span> In Persia "the royal house" was the special object of regard. Individual kings must die, but the house would go on (see the speech of Artemisia to Xerxes in 'Herod.,' 8:102; and compare the references to the "gods of the royal house" in the Inscriptions). Kings took special care of their sons. Thus Cyrus sent Cambyses back to Persia when he was about to attack the Massagetae ('Herod.,' 1:208), and Xerxes gave several of his sons into the charge of Artemisia, to convey them by ship to Asia, while he himself took the long and perilous journey by land (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 8:103). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-12 When God's time is come for fulfilling his gracious purposes concerning his church, he will raise up instruments to do it, from whom such good service was not expected. While our thoughts are directed to this event, we are led by Zechariah to fix our regard on a nobler, a spiritual building. The Lord Jesus Christ continues to lay one stone upon another: let us assist the great design. Difficulties delay the progress of this sacred edifice. Yet let not opposition discourage us, for in due season it will be completed to his abundant praise. He shall bring forth the head-stone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.</body></html>
