The decree adds a word that signifies "with sufficient support."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifice.</span> Or, "the place where they may offer sacrifice." It is the future, rather than the past, which Cyrus is contemplating. <span class="cmt_word">Let the foundation thereof be strongly laid</span>. Isaiah had prophesied that Cyrus should "say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, <span class="accented">Thy foundation shall be laid"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Cyrus adds an injunction that the foundations be laid "supportingly," or "strongly," that so the house may the longer continue. <span class="cmt_word">The height thereof threescore cubits.</span> Half the height of the first temple, according to the existing text of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>); but one-third <span class="accented">more</span> than the previous height, as estimated by the author of Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the breadth thereof threescore cubits.</span> This breadth is thrice that of the main building, according to both Chronicles and Kings. It is even double that of the old temple, <span class="accented">with the side chambers</span>, which occupied a space of five cubits, or seven and a half feet, on either wing. That such an enlargement actually took effect would seem to be most improbable; and we may perhaps conclude that Cyrus designed a building on a grander scale than Zerubbabel, with the resources at his disposal, was able to erect. It is curious that Cyrus did not in his decree specify the length of the temple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-12 When God's time is come for fulfilling his gracious purposes concerning his church, he will raise up instruments to do it, from whom such good service was not expected. While our thoughts are directed to this event, we are led by Zechariah to fix our regard on a nobler, a spiritual building. The Lord Jesus Christ continues to lay one stone upon another: let us assist the great design. Difficulties delay the progress of this sacred edifice. Yet let not opposition discourage us, for in due season it will be completed to his abundant praise. He shall bring forth the head-stone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.</body></html>
