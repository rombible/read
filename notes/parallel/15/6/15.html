Haggai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm" title="In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.">Haggai 1:15</a>) gives the exact date of the re-commencement: the time therefore was four years five months and ten days. But, dating from the first foundation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm" title="And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.">Ezra 3:10</a>), no less than twenty-one years had elapsed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house was finished on the third day of the month Adar. Haggai</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>) gives the exact day of the recommencement of the work as the twenty-fourth of Elul in Darius's second year. Ezra here gives the exact day of the completion. From Zerubbabel's laying of the foundation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>), the time that had elapsed was twenty-one years. From the recommencement under the inspiriting influence of the two prophets, the time was only four years, five months, and ten days. DEDICATION OF THE SECOND TEMPLE (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-18</a>). Following the example of Solomon, who had solemnly "dedicated" the first temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), and had offered on the occasion a sacrifice unexampled for its magnitude in the whole of Jewish history (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), Zerubbabel now, under the advice of two prophets, inaugurated the new building with a similar ceremony. In "the day of small things" it was not possible for him to emulate Solomon's magnificence in respect of the number of victims. Solomon had sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. Zerubbabel's means only enabled him to make an offering of 712 animals, more than half of them lambs. He did, however, according to his ability; and God, who accepts all our endeavours according to that we have, and not according to that we have not, was content to receive graciously the humble offering made to him, and to bless the building thus inaugurated with a glory unknown to the first temple. The Lord himself, the Messenger of the covenant, so long sought by his people, suddenly came to this temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>) - came to it, and frequented it, and taught in it, and gave it a dignity and a majesty far beyond the first temple, which possessed indeed the Shechinah, but was once, and once only, vouchsafed a brief manifestation of the actual Divine presence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:13-22 The gospel church, that spiritual temple, is long in the building, but it will be finished at last, when the mystical body is completed. Every believer is a living temple, building up himself in his most holy faith: much opposition is given to this work by Satan and our own corruptions. We trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses; but He that has begun the good work, will see it performed. Then spirits of just men will be made perfect. By getting their sins taken away, the Jews would free themselves from the sting of their late troubles. Their service was with joy. Let us welcome holy ordinances with joy, and serve the Lord with gladness.</body></html>
