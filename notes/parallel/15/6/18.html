This arrangement was based upon the ordinances of the law with respect to the respective offices of the two orders, as given in the Book of Numbers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-26</a>), and, so far, was <span class="cmt_word">according to the writing of the book of Moses.</span> But the "courses" themselves were not established till David's time. CELEBRATION OF THE PASSOVER IN THE ENSUING MONTH, AND OBSERVANCE OF THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-19.htm">Ezra 6:19-22</a>). Specially solemn passovers were celebrated on specially solemn occasions; and these received special record at the hands of the sacred writers. Of this kind are the passover celebrated By Hezekiah in the year <span class="date">B.C. 726</span>, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a>, and that celebrated by Josiah in <span class="date">B.C. 624</span>, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35.htm">2 Chronicles 35</a>. Both of these followed upon a cleansing of the temple, and restoration of the temple worship after a period of suspension. Ezra seems to place the passover of <span class="date">B.C. 516</span> in the same category. It marked the period of the full re-establishment of the regular ordinances of religion, more or less interrupted from the time of the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. It terminated the abnormal and commenced the normal condition of things. Perhaps it is to mark this, that Ezra at this point disuses the Chaldee dialect, which he had introduced in ch. 4:8, and returns to the Hebrew, the established language of the Jewish religion. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:13-22 The gospel church, that spiritual temple, is long in the building, but it will be finished at last, when the mystical body is completed. Every believer is a living temple, building up himself in his most holy faith: much opposition is given to this work by Satan and our own corruptions. We trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses; but He that has begun the good work, will see it performed. Then spirits of just men will be made perfect. By getting their sins taken away, the Jews would free themselves from the sting of their late troubles. Their service was with joy. Let us welcome holy ordinances with joy, and serve the Lord with gladness.</body></html>
