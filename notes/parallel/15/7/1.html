Ezra omits the names of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, who were undistinguished, and claims descent from Seraiah, the last high priest who had ministered in Solomon's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Azariah</span>, the father of Seraiah, does not occur in either Kings or Chronicles; but <span class="cmt_word">Hilkiah</span>, Azariah's father, is no doubt the high priest of Josiah's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-14.htm">2 Chronicles 34:14-22</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-10 Ezra went from Babylon to Jerusalem, for the good of his country. The king was kind to him; he granted all his requests, whatever Ezra desired to enable him to serve his country. When he went, many went with him; he obtained favour from his king, by the Divine favour. Every creature is that to us, which God makes it to be. We must see the hand of God in the events that befal us, and acknowledge him with thankfulness.</body></html>
