The form of his thanksgiving a little resembles that of David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-10.htm">1 Chronicles 29:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of</span> <span class="cmt_word">our fathers</span> is an unusual phrase, only elsewhere employed by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-18.htm">1 Chronicles 29:18</a>) and Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>). "<span class="accented">God</span> of our fathers" is more common, being found in Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-7.htm">Deuteronomy 26:7</a>) and Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-30.htm">Acts 5:30</a>), as well as in Chronicles frequently. <span class="cmt_word">Which hath put such a thought as this in the king's heart.</span> Compare Ezra 1:1. and Ezra 6:22. All thoughts favorable to the Jews are regarded by Ezra as impressed upon the hearts of heathen kings by the direct action of God. To beautify. Or "adorn." Ezra gathers from the general tenor of the king's letter that the adornment of the temple is his main object (see comment on ver. 17). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:27,28 Two things Ezra blessed God for: 1. For his commission. If any good appear in our hearts, or in the hearts of others, we must own that God put it there, and bless him; it is he that worketh in us, both to will and to do that which is good. 2. For his encouragement: God has extended mercy to me. Ezra was a man of courage, yet he ascribed this not to his own heart, but to God's hand. If God give us his hand, we are bold and cheerful; if he withdraw it, we are weak as water. Whatever we are enabled to do for God and those around us, God must have all the glory.</body></html>
