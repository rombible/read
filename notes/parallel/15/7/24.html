Hitherto the king has made every permission and command to rest on his own sole authority (see vers. 12, 13, 21). Now that he reaches the most important point in the whole of his decree - the permanent exemption of a large part of the people from liability to taxation of any kind, his style changes, and he says, "<span class="accented">We</span> certify you." Perhaps he speaks in the name of himself <span class="accented">and his successors</span>; or possibly he means to say that in this matter he has asked and obtained the assent and consent of his council (compare ver. 28). Or ministers. Rather, "and ministers." It is generally allowed that the word here translated "ministers" is not applied to the Nethinim, but to that still lower grade of attendants in the sanctuary called "Solomon's servants" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-55.htm">Ezra 2:55-58</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-57.htm">Nehemiah 7:57-60</a>. <span class="cmt_word">It shall not be lawful</span> <span class="cmt_word">to impose toll, tribute, or custom upon them</span> It may be suspected from this proviso that the Persians exempted from taxation their own (Magian) priests, though of this there is no other evidence. But they would scarcely have placed a foreign priesthood on a higher level of favour than their own. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-26 The liberality of heathen kings to support the worship of God, reproached the conduct of many kings of Judah, and will rise up in judgment against the covetousness of wealthy professed Christians, who will not promote the cause of God. But the weapons of Christian ministers are not carnal. Faithful preaching, holy lives, fervent prayers, and patient suffering when called to it, are the means to bring men into obedience to Christ.</body></html>
