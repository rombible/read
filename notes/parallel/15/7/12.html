"King of kings, <span class="accented">kkshayathiya khshaya-thiyanam</span>," an equivalent of the modern <span class="accented">shahinshah</span>, was a recognised title of the Persian monarchs, and is found in every Persian inscription of any considerable length (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persis,' vol. 1 pp. 195, 271, 279, 287, 292, etc.). It was a title that had been used occasionally, though not at all frequently, by the Assyrian monarchs ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 41; vol. 5. p. 8), and naturally expressed the fact that those monarchs for the most part maintained the native princes on the thrones of the countries which they conquered (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>). It was less appropriate to the Persians, whose empire was in the main satrapial, but still had a basis of truth to rest upon, since the Persian monarch had always a certain number of tributary kings under him ( cf. 'Herod.,' 5:104, 118; 8:142; Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:2, &sect;12; 'Hellen.,' 4:1,&sect;&sect; 3,4,etc.). The Parthian kings took the title from the time of Mithridates I.; and from them it passed to the Sassanians, who style themselves <span class="accented">malkan malka</span>, from first to last, upon their coins. <span class="cmt_word">The God</span> <span class="cmt_word">of heaven.</span> On this favourite Persian expression see comment on Ezra 1:2. <span class="cmt_word">Perfect peace.</span> There is nothing in the Chaldee original in any way corresponding to "peace;" and the participle passage being translated as in the margin of the A. V. - "to Ezra the priest, a perfect scribe of the law of the God of heaven." <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">at such a time.</span> Rather, "and so forth," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10, 11, 17</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-26 The liberality of heathen kings to support the worship of God, reproached the conduct of many kings of Judah, and will rise up in judgment against the covetousness of wealthy professed Christians, who will not promote the cause of God. But the weapons of Christian ministers are not carnal. Faithful preaching, holy lives, fervent prayers, and patient suffering when called to it, are the means to bring men into obedience to Christ.</body></html>
