These powers were always intrusted by the Persians to the civil administrators of provinces, who were autocrats within their respective territories, and responsible to the king alone for the exercise of their authority. EZRA'S THANKSGIVING ON RECEIPT OF ARTAXERXES' LETTER (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27, 28</a>). With an abruptness that may appear strange, but which has many parallels in the works of Oriental writers, Ezra passes without a word of explanation from Artaxerxes' letter to his own thanksgiving upon the receipt of it. Compare the interjectional prayers of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9, 14</a>, etc.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-26 The liberality of heathen kings to support the worship of God, reproached the conduct of many kings of Judah, and will rise up in judgment against the covetousness of wealthy professed Christians, who will not promote the cause of God. But the weapons of Christian ministers are not carnal. Faithful preaching, holy lives, fervent prayers, and patient suffering when called to it, are the means to bring men into obedience to Christ.</body></html>
