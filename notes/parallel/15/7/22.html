If we adopt the views of Mr. R.S. Peele ('Dict. of the Bible, Articles, MONEY and WEIGHTS AND MEASURES), it would authorise drawing to the amount of &pound;40,000. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">hundred measures of wheat.</span> Literally, "a hundred <span class="accented">cors</span> of wheat," as given in the margin. The <span class="accented">cor</span> is variously estimated, at 44.25 gallons and at 86.67 gallons. It contained ten <span class="accented">baths.</span> Orders on the treasury for so much wheat, wine, oil, and salt sound strangely in modern ears; but were natural enough in the Persian system, where taxation was partly in kind, and every province had to remit to the court the choicest portion of its produce. Wine, corn, oil, and salt were all of them produced abundantly in Palestine, which was "a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of off olive, and of honey" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-32.htm">2 Kings 18:32</a>), and which, in the region about the Dead Sea, abounded with salt. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-26 The liberality of heathen kings to support the worship of God, reproached the conduct of many kings of Judah, and will rise up in judgment against the covetousness of wealthy professed Christians, who will not promote the cause of God. But the weapons of Christian ministers are not carnal. Faithful preaching, holy lives, fervent prayers, and patient suffering when called to it, are the means to bring men into obedience to Christ.</body></html>
