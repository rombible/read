Egypt had revolted from the Persians in <span class="date">B.C. 460</span>, and in the following year, with the assistance of the Athenians, had driven the last Persian out of the country. A vain attempt was made by an embassy to Sparta, towards the close of <span class="date">B.C. 459</span>, to force Athens to recall her troops. In <span class="date">B.C. 458</span>, Artaxerxes' seventh year, it was resolved that a Persian force should attempt the recovery of the revolted country. Artaxerxes gives his <span class="accented">firman</span> to Ezra when this expedition is preparing to start, and partly alludes to the past "wrath," shown in the success of the rebels, partly deprecates any further visitation. Without pretending to penetrate the Divine counsels, it may be noticed that from the year <span class="date">B.C. 458</span> things went well for the Persians in Egypt. Memphis was recovered in that year or the next; and in <span class="date">B.C. 455</span> the Athenians were finally defeated, and the province recovered. <span class="cmt_word">The king and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons.</span> This mention of the "sons" of Artaxerxes has been regarded as a proof that the Artaxerxes of Esther was Mnemon, and not Longimanus (Patrick). But it is quite a gratuitous supposition that Longimanus, who had attained to manhood before he ascended the throne, had no sons in the seventh year of his reign. Ultimately he left behind him eighteen sons (Ctesias, 'Exc. Pers.,' &sect; 44). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:11-26 The liberality of heathen kings to support the worship of God, reproached the conduct of many kings of Judah, and will rise up in judgment against the covetousness of wealthy professed Christians, who will not promote the cause of God.

Faithful preaching, holy lives, fervent prayers, and patient suffering when called to it, are the means to bring men into obedience to Christ.</body></html>
