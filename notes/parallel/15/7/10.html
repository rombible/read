Besides these temporary enactments, the decree contained certain provisions of a more permanent nature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Ezra was invested with the chief authority over the whole district "beyond the river," and was commissioned to appoint all the subordinate "magistrates and judges" (ver. 25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He was authorised to enforce his decisions by the penalties of imprisonment, confiscation of goods, banishment, and even death itself (ver. 26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> An exemption from taxation of every kind was granted to all grades of the sacerdotal order - to the priests, the Levites, the singers, the porters, the Nethinim, and the lowest grade of "ministers" - to all, in fact, who were engaged in the performance of any sacred function connected with the temple (ver. 24).
