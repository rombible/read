The Samaritans suggest a consultation of this book, which would at any rate contain their own previous accusations against Jerusalem (<span class="accented">supra</span>, vers. 5, 6), and might make some mention of the revolts from Babylon (see the comment on ver. 12). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">which cause was this city destroyed.</span> This was the great fact on which the Samaritans relied.

Nothing can be more false, for true godliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely. But God's judgment is just; he sees things as they are.</body></html>
