"</span>We seek your God" was true; "as ye do" was not true. The Samaritans worshipped Jehovah, but not, as the Jews did, exclusively. "They feared the Lord, <span class="accented">and worshipped their own gods"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-33.htm">2 Kings 17:33</a>). Such worship dishonours Jehovah almost more than total neglect of him. <span class="cmt_word">Since the</span> <span class="cmt_word">days of Esar-haddon.</span> There was more than one colonisation of Central Palestine by the Assyrians. Sargon relates that he placed Arabians in the country; the writer of Kings tells us that it was occupied by Babylonians, Cuthaeans, Avites, Hamathites, and Sepharrites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>); the Samaritans themselves said that they were "Dinaites, Apharsathchites, Tarpelites, Apharsites, Archevites, Babylonians, Susanchites, Debarites, and Elamites" (<span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 9). They attributed this last colonization to Esar-haddon. We may suspect that the second colonisation was by Sennacherib, who appears to have taken Babylon, Hamath, Sepharvaim, and Ivah or Avah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a>). The result was that the Samaritans were a very mixed race. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 Every attempt to revive true religion will stir up the opposition of Satan, and of those in whom he works. The adversaries were the Samaritans, who had been planted in the land of Israel, 2Ki 17. It was plain that they did not mean to unite in the worship of the Lord, according to his word. Let those who discourage a good work, and weaken them that are employed in it, see whose pattern they follow.</body></html>
