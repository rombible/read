They reveal a state of apathy which Ezra does not allude to; such a state of things, in fact, as would have thwarted the whole design of Providence had it not been changed. Hence the abrupt return of the spirit of prophecy, some of the last utterances of which provoked or "stirred up "--as Cyrus had been stirred up--the spirit of the two leaders and of the heads of the families.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="cmt_word"> - Zechariah the son of Iddo.</span> Really the grandson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>).

Then they had two good ministers, who urged them to go on with the work. It is a sign that God has mercy in store for a people, when he raises up prophets to be helpers in the way and work of God, as guides, overseers, and rulers. In Haggai, we see what great things God does by his word, which he magnifies above all his name, and by his Spirit working with it.</body></html>
