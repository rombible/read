Mainly by their long series of idolatries, with the moral abominations that those idolatries involved - the sacrifice of children by their own parents, the licentious rites belonging to the worship of Baal, and the unmentionable horrors practised by the devotees of the Dea Syra. For centuries, with only short and rare intervals, "the chief of the priests, and the people, had transgressed very much after <span class="accented">all</span> the abominations of the heathen," and had even "polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon</span>. He punished, as he always does, national apostasy with national destruction. Making an idolatrous people, but a less guilty one, his sword, he cut off Judah, as he had previously cut off Israel, causing the national life to cease, and even removing the bulk of the people into a distant country. Not by his own power or might did Nebuchadnezzar prevail. God could have delivered the Jews from him as easily as he had delivered them in former days from Jabin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2-24</a>), and from Zerah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11-15</a>), and from Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20-36</a>). But he was otherwise minded; he "<span class="accented">gave them into the hand</span> of Nebuchadnezzar" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>). He divided their counsels, paralysed their resistance, caused Pharaoh Hophra to desert their cause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>), and left them helpless and unprotected. Nebuchadnczzar was his instrument to chastise his guilty people, and in pursuing his own ends merely worked out the purposes of the Almighty. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-17 While employed in God's work, we are under his special protection; his eye is upon us for good. This should keep us to our duty, and encourage us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from his unmerited mercy. However the work may seem to be hindered, yet the Lord Jesus Christ is carrying it on, his people are growing unto a holy temple in the Lord, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.</body></html>
