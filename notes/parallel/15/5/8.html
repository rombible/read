Tatnai probably dwelt at Damascus, and when he went to Jerusalem was deeply impressed. But he only gives a statement of the progress which he observed in the Temple. "The walls here are the walls within the Temple, not the city walls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We went into the province of</span> Judaea. It has been supposed (Pusey's 'Daniel,' p. 571), on the strength of a doubtful passage in Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-7.htm">Nehemiah 3:7</a>), that Tatnai ordinarily resided at Jernsalem. But this expression indicates the contrary. Most probably the satrap of Syria held his court at Damascus. <span class="cmt_word">The house of the great God</span> is a remarkable expression in the mouth of a heathen. It has some parallels, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the expressions of Cyrus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>, and of Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a> and Daniel 3:29; but they were persons who had been brought to the knowledge that Jehovah was the one true God, under very peculiar and miraculous circumstances. Tatnai, on the other hand, represents the mere ordinary Persian official; and his acknowledgment of the God of the Jews as "the great God" must be held to indicate the general belief of the Persians on the subject (see the comment on Ezra 1:2). <span class="cmt_word">Which is builded</span>. Rather, "being builded." <span class="cmt_word">With great stones.</span> Literally, "stones of rolling," which is commonly explained as stones so large that they had to be rolled along the ground. But the squared stones used in building neither were, nor could be, rolled; they are always represented as dragged, generally on a rough sledge. And it is not at all probable that in the "day of small things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>) the Jews were building with very large stones. The LXX. translate "choice stones;" the Vulgate "unpolished" or "rough stone." Some of the Jewish expositors suggest "marble." <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">timber is laid</span>. A good deal of timber had been employed in the old temple, but chiefly for the floors of chambers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-10.htm">1 Kings 6:10</a>), for the internal lining of the walls (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 9, 15), and probably for the roofing. In the new temple, timber seems to have been employed also as the main material of the party-walls. Here again we have a trace of the economy necessary in the "day of small things." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-17 While employed in God's work, we are under his special protection; his eye is upon us for good. This should keep us to our duty, and encourage us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from his unmerited mercy. However the work may seem to be hindered, yet the Lord Jesus Christ is carrying it on, his people are growing unto a holy temple in the Lord, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.</body></html>
