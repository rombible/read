What Shimshai was to the Samaritan Pechah, Rehum, Shethar-boznai seems to be to Tatnai--his secretary.<p><span class= "bld">Who hath commanded you?</span>--It is obvious that the overthrow of Smerdis, the Magian hater of Zoroastrianism and destroyer of temples, had encouraged the builders to go on without fearing molestation from the Court of Darius. Moreover, the two prophets had made their duty too plain to be deferred. Still, the decree of the preceding chapter had never been expressly revoked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tatnai</span>, <span class="cmt_word">governor on this side the river</span>. The title given to Tatnai is the same which is assigned to Zerubbabel, both in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-7.htm">Ezra 6:7</a> and in Haggai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1, 14</a>, etc.), viz., <span class="accented">pechah</span>, which is a somewhat vague term of authority, translated sometimes <span class="accented">"captain"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-24.htm">1 Kings 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2, 3</a>, etc.), sometimes "deputy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-3.htm">Esther 9:3</a>), but generally, as here, "governor." The etymology is uncertain, but seems not to be Semitic (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' pp. 570-572). The respective rank of Tatnai and Zerub-babel is indicated, not by this term, but by what follows it. Tatnai was <span class="accented">pechah</span> "<span class="accented">be</span>yond the river," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> governor of the whole tract west of the Euphrates; Zerubbabel was <span class="accented">pechah</span> of Judah only. A Greek writer would have called the one "<span class="accented">satrap</span> of Syria," the other "<span class="accented">sub-satrap</span> of Judaea." It was the duty of Tatuai to watch the proceedings of his sub-satraps. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:3-17 While employed in God's work, we are under his special protection; his eye is upon us for good. This should keep us to our duty, and encourage us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from his unmerited mercy. However the work may seem to be hindered, yet the Lord Jesus Christ is carrying it on, his people are growing unto a holy temple in the Lord, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.</body></html>
