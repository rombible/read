Ezra had magnified God's providence before the king: His "hand" upon his own "for good"--the habitual tribute to Providence in this book and Nehemiah--and His power "against" His enemies "for evil" not being expressed. This sublime testimony made the "seeking" God a condition of safety. Hence the solemn fasting and prayer, following many precedents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.">Judges 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm" title="And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.">1Samuel 7:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - I <span class="cmt_word">was ashamed to require of the king</span> <span class="cmt_word">a band of soldiers</span>. Before he apprehended danger Ezra had boasted to Artaxerxes of the power and goodness of God, and had spoken of himself and his brethren as assured of the Divine protection. Now that peril threatened he found himself afraid, and would have been glad of such an escort as Nehemiah obtained at a later date (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-9.htm">Nehemiah 2:9</a>). But after his boasts he was ashamed to confess his fear. Who the <span class="cmt_word">enemy in the way</span> was it is impossible to decide; but we may gather from ver. 31 that it was no imaginary foe. Probably some of the Arab tribes, who owed no allegiance to Persia, had formed a design to intercept the caravan and plunder it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:21-23 Ezra procured Levites to go with him; but what will that avail, unless he have God with him? Those who seek God, are safe under the shadow of his wings, even in their greatest dangers; but those who forsake him, are always exposed. When entering upon any new state of life, our care should be, to bring none of the guilt of the sins of our former condition into it. When we are in any peril, let us be at peace with God, and then nothing can do us any real hurt. All our concerns about ourselves, our families, and our estates, it is our wisdom and duty, by prayer to commit to God, and to leave the care of them with him. And, on some occasions, we should decline advantages which are within our reach, lest we should cause others to stumble, and so our God be dishonoured. Let us ask wisdom of God, that we may know how to use or to refuse lawful things. We shall be no losers by venturing, suffering, or giving up for the Lord's sake. Their prayers were answered, and the event declared it. Never have any that sought God in earnest, found that they sought him in vain. In times of difficulty and danger, to set a season apart for secret or for social prayer, is the best method for relief we can take.</body></html>
