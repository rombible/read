Jezebel proclaimed one in Ahab's name when she wished to impress the Jezreelites with the notion that a great crime had been committed. Jehoshaphat did the same when he was invaded by the Ammonites, Moabites, and Mehunim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-3</a>). A fast was proclaimed in the fifth year of Jehoiakim when the kingdom of Judah was menaced by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a>). Ezra therefore assumes that he may command one now, in connection with the perils of the coming journey. <span class="cmt_word">That we might afflict ourselves.</span> The Jews were commanded to "afflict themselves" on the great day of atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>), and understood that the affliction was to be mainly by fasting and abstaining from the bath. <span class="cmt_word">To ask of him a right</span> <span class="cmt_word">way.</span> Or "a direct road," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a prosperous and unimpeded journey to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">For us</span> <span class="cmt_word">and our little ones.</span> The colonists went up attended by their families. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:21-23 Ezra procured Levites to go with him; but what will that avail, unless he have God with him? Those who seek God, are safe under the shadow of his wings, even in their greatest dangers; but those who forsake him, are always exposed. When entering upon any new state of life, our care should be, to bring none of the guilt of the sins of our former condition into it. When we are in any peril, let us be at peace with God, and then nothing can do us any real hurt. All our concerns about ourselves, our families, and our estates, it is our wisdom and duty, by prayer to commit to God, and to leave the care of them with him. And, on some occasions, we should decline advantages which are within our reach, lest we should cause others to stumble, and so our God be dishonoured. Let us ask wisdom of God, that we may know how to use or to refuse lawful things. We shall be no losers by venturing, suffering, or giving up for the Lord's sake. Their prayers were answered, and the event declared it. Never have any that sought God in earnest, found that they sought him in vain. In times of difficulty and danger, to set a season apart for secret or for social prayer, is the best method for relief we can take.</body></html>
