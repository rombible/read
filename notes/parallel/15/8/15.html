The importance of Levitcal service in the Temple accounts for the anxiety of Ezra.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava</span>. The "river that runneth to Ahava" is now generally identified with the Is of Herodotus (1:179), a small stream flowing into the Euphrates from the east, at a point where stood a city of the same name, distant (according to Herodotus) <span class="accented">eight</span> days' journey from Babylon. The city appears to be mentioned under the slightly variant forms of Ava (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) and Ivah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) in the Second Book of Kings (2 Kings 17:24; 19:13). It is called Aia, or Aba, by the LXX.; Ihi in the Talmud; Aei by Isidore of Charax. The modern name is Hit. The town has always been one of some importance in connection with the bitumen springs of the neighbourhood. Ezra s reason for selecting the place as a halting-point seems to have been the fact that many Jews were settled in the district (see ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">We abode in tents</span>. A large caravan, like Ezra's, even when it reached a town, would pitch its tents outside, and remain in them rather than scatter itself among the khans and caravanserais. The phrase is therefore to be understood literally. <span class="cmt_word">I viewed</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people.</span> Rather, "I looked among the people" - I looked to see whether there were any Levites or no. ("Quaesivi in populo et in sacerdotibus <span class="accented">de filiis Levi<span class="cmt_word">.</span></span> <span class="cmt_word"><span class="accented">-</span></span> Vulg.) <span class="cmt_word">And found there none of the sons of Levi</span>. It is difficult to account for the fact; but there seems certainly to have been a special disinclination to return to Jerusalem on the part of the Levites. Only seventy-four went up with Zerubbabel, when the priests who returned were 4289 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36-40</a>); and now there was not a single one in the whole of Ezra's band. Did the jealous spirit of Korah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-8.htm">Numbers 16:8-10</a>) still animate the great body of the tribe? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-20 Ezra assembles the outcasts of Israel, and the dispersed of Judah. God raised up the spirits of a small remnant to accompany him. What a pity that good men should omit a good work, for want of being spoken to!</body></html>
