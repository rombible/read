The word "very" (not in Sam.) is perhaps an accidental repetition from the Hebrew of <span class= "ital">I am in a great strait.</span><p><span class= "bld">Let me not fall.</span>--Samuel has a precative form of the same verb ('<span class= "ital">epp?l?h;</span> here 'epp?l).<p>David confesses inability to choose. So much only is clear to him, that it is better to be dependent on the compassion of God than of man; and thus, by implication he decides against the second alternative, leaving the rest to God. Famine, sword, and pestilence were each regarded as Divine visitations, but the last especially so, because of the apparent suddenness of its outbreak and the mysterious nature of its operation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - It is in such answers as these - answers of equal piety and practical wisdom, that the difference is often visible between the man radically bad, and the man good at heart and the child of grace, even when fallen into the deepest depth of sin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.</body></html>
