The parallel place says, "The Prophet Gad (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>), David's seer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-11.htm">2 Samuel 24:11</a>). The Hebrew word here used in both passages for "seer," is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, in place of the word of higher import, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, the use of which is confined to Samuel, Hanani, and to the person spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>. In this last passage our Authorized Version translates "prophet" while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a> our Authorized Version translates both Hebrew names in the very same verse by the one English word "seer." Gad was, perhaps, a pupil of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-8.htm">2 Samuel 22:8</a>), and was the successor of Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>) in this office. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.</body></html>
