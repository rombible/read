And the king swore to him.">2Samuel 19:23</a> the sons of Zeruiah are called "adversaries" (Heb., a <span class= "ital">Satan</span>) to David. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.">1Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm" title="And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.">1Kings 11:25</a>.) When <span class= "ital">the</span> adversary, the enemy of mankind, is meant, the word takes the article, which it has not here. (Comp. Job 1, 2 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And provoked David.</span>--<span class= "ital">Pricked him on, incited him.</span> 2 Samuel 24 begins: "And again the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He (or <span class= "ital">it</span>) incited David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah." It thus appears that the <span class= "ital">adversary</span> of our text, the influence hostile to Israel, was the wrath of God. The wrath of God is the Scriptural name for that aspect of the Divine nature under which it pursues to destruction whatever is really opposed to its own perfection (Delitzsch); and it is only sin, i.e., breach of the Divine law, which can necessarily direct that aspect towards man. If Divine wrath urged David to number Israel, it can only have been in consequence of evil thoughts of pride and self-sufficiency, which had intruded into a heart hitherto humbly reliant upon its Maker. One evil thought led to another, quite <span class= "ital">naturally; i.e.,</span> by the laws which God has imposed upon human nature. God did not interpose, but allowed David's corrupt motive to work out its own penal results. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm" title="For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:">Romans 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>.) The true reading in Samuel may well be, "And an adversary incited David," &c., the word Satan having fallen out of the text. Yet the expression "Jehovah provoked <span class= "ital">or</span> incited against . . ." occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.">1Samuel 26:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To number Israel</span>--Samuel adds, "and Judah."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</span> This remarkable sentence takes the place of the statements in the parallel, "And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah." Our own passage seems to confine the temptation and sin to David. David also seems to be spoken of as the object of malignant attack on the part of Satan, though Israel is spoken of as the object of malignant envy and animosity. It is also to be noticed that in ver. 17 David takes all the blame to himself, and speaks of the people as "innocent sheep." A people and whole nation have, indeed, often suffered the smart of one ruler's sin. Yet here the light thrown upon the whole event by the account in the Book of Samuel must be accepted as revealing the fact that there had been previously something amiss on the part of the people - perhaps something of illest significance lurking in their constitution. This alone could "kindle the anger of the Lord against Israel." It is the opposite of this which kindles the anger of Satan - when he witnesses excellence, surpassing excellence, as when he witnesses "the <span class="accented">weakest</span> saint," yet in that strongest position," <span class="accented">on his knees."</span> The apparent inconsistency in Satan being spoken of as resisting Israel, and the anger of the Lord being spoken of as kindled against Israel, is but apparent and superficial. In the first place, these histories do only purport to state the facts <span class="accented">overt.</span> And in this sense either alternative statement gives the <span class="accented">prima facie</span> facts. Either is true, and both may be true in different chronological order. And further, that the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel is no disproof that Satan will see and seize his opportunity. It looks the contrary way. There was a time and an occasion in Eden when Satan thought he saw an opportunity, tried it, and found it, when the anger of the Lord was <span class="accented">not</span> kindled against Adam and Eve for certain. But much more prompt will be the <span class="accented">executive</span> of Satan at another and less doubtful time. The paths in written history are often awhile rugged and broken up; the written history of Scripture is no exception. And in thus being the more in analogy with history <span class="accented">itself</span>, those unevennesses and breaks are the better attestation of both the reality of the Scripture history and the veracity of its writers. The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) occurs twenty-four times in the Old Testament. On all occasions of its occurrence in the Book of Job and in the prophecies of Zechariah, it shows the prefixed definite article; in all other places it is, with the present passage, unaccompanied by the article. Its translation here might appear strictly as that of a proper name. But this cannot be said of the other instances of its use, when without the article (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-4.htm">1 Samuel 29:4</a>). This constitutes with some the ground of the very opposite opinion and opposite translation. If we regard the name as utterly expressing the personality of Satan, the passage is very noteworthy, and will be most safely regarded as the language of the compiler, and not as copied from the original source. The signification of the word "Satan," as is well known, is "adversary," or "accuser." The sin of David in giving the order of this verse was of a technical and ceremonial character, in the first place, whatever his motives were, and however intensified by other causes of a moral and more individual complexion. We learn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>) the special enactments respecting what was to be observed when "the sum of the children of Israel after their number" was to be taken. However, the same passage does not say, it fails to say, when such a numbering would be legitimate or when not. It is left us, therefore, to deduce this from observation. And we notice, in the first place, that, on the occasion of its undoubted rightness, it is the work of the distinct commandment of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1-4</a>). Next, we notice the religious contribution, "the ransom," that was required with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-48.htm">Numbers 31:48-54</a>). Again, we notice that the numberings narrated both in the beginning of the Book of Numbers (1.) and toward the close (26.) had specific moral objects as assigned by God - among them the forcible teaching of the loss entailed by the successive rebellions of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-64.htm">Numbers 26:64, 65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14, 15</a>). And though last, not least, all these indications are lighted up by the express and emphatic announcements in God's original promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that their seed should become <span class="accented">past</span> numbering, multitudinous as the stars, and as the sands of the seashore. From all which we may conclude that only <span class="accented">that</span> numbering was held legitimate which was for God's service in some form, and as <span class="accented">against</span> human pride and boastfulness - by God's command as against a human king's fancy - and which was attended by the payment of that solemn "ransom" money, the <span class="accented">bekah</span>, or half-shekel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>). Other numbering had snares about it, and it was no doubt because it had such <span class="accented">intrinsically</span> that it was divinely discountenanced, and in this case severely punished. It seems gratuitous with some to tax David with having other motives than those of some sort of vanity now at work, sinister designs of preparing, unaided and unpermitted, some fresh military exploits, or stealing a march on the nation itself in the matter of some new system of taxation. The context offers no corroboration of either of these notions, while several lesser indications point to the simplest explanation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-23.htm">1 Chronicles 27:23</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.</body></html>
