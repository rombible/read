It is at this point <span class="accented">first</span> that any mention of an <span class="accented">angel</span> is found in the parallel place, but then not in the present form, but in a sentence which would seem to presuppose the knowledge of the agency of an angel on the occasion: "And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan</span>. The verb "stood" is employed here quite generically. It does not imply that the angel stood on the ground; for see next verse, in which it is said that he "stood between the earth and the heaven," the Hebrew verb being exactly the same. <span class="accented">Ornan is</span> the uniform form and spelling of the name in Chronicles. In Samuel, however, the name appears as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-20.htm">2 Samuel 24:20</a>), or <span class="accented">Araunah.</span> Yet in ver. 16, of the same chapter the Kethiv inverts the order of the <span class="accented">resh</span> and <span class="accented">vau</span>, prefixing the article, or what looks like it, and again in ver. 18 the Kethiv shows the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Ornan, then, or Arauuah, was a descendant of the old Jebusite race to whom the fort of Zion once belonged. And the present narrative finds him living on the Hill of Moriah (Conder's' Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., 236 [6]). <span class="accented">The threshing-floor.</span> The primitive threshing-floors of the Israelites still essentially obtain. They were level spots of stamped and well-trodden earth, about fifty feet in diameter, and selected in positions most exposed to the wind, in order to take the advantage of its help in the separating of the grain from the chaff. On these circular spots of hard earth the sheaves of grain, of whatever kind, were distributed in all sorts of disorder. Oxen and other cattle trod them. And sometimes these beasts were driven round and round five abreast. The stalk of the grain was, of course, much bruised and crushed, and the method is described still as of a very rough and wasteful kind. Instruments were also employed, as the "flail" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-17.htm">Ruth 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27, 28</a>); the "sledge," to which possibly reference is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-7.htm">Judges 8:7, 16</a>, under the name <span class="accented">barkanim</span> (Authorized Version, "briers"). These sledges were of two kinds: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">morag</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-23.htm">1 Chronicles 21:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>), made of fiat planks joined together, and furnished with rough studs on the under surface; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">agalah</span>, rendered Authorized Version, "cart-wheel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>), made of wooden rollers, or rollers of iron or stone, and dragged by cattle over the sheaves. Egypt and Syria, as well as Palestine, still show these instruments (see Robinson's 'Bibl. Res.,' 1:550; and Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' pp. 538-541). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.</body></html>
