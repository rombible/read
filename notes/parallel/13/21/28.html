The words "then he sacrificed there" refer to this fact. The answer by fire from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm" title="And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering.">1Chronicles 21:26</a>) was an unmistakable intimation of the Divine will that it should be so. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-15.htm" title="And the captain of the LORD's host said to Joshua, Loose your shoe from off your foot; for the place where on you stand is holy.

David "saw "this by the fire on the altar, and by the fact that God, at the voice of the angel (ver. 18), had not misdirected him, but had guided him aright. <span class="cmt_word">He sacrificed there</span>. This means to say that he <span class="accented">thenceforward</span> "<span class="accented">sacrificed</span> there;" and <span class="accented">established</span> there the service of sacrifices. David was so impressed "at that <span class="accented">time</span>," by the answer given in fire from heaven, that he began systematically to sacrifice on the site of this threshing-floor, instead of going to the high place at Gibeon, where the altar of burnt offering still stood. To have attempted to go thither would not only have meant a long and wasteful delay, but would also have meant the neglecting of the august omen of the angel present. An awful sanction is thus given to" <span class="accented">this place</span>," Moriah, and it becomes" <span class="accented">the house of the Lord God</span>," and the place of lawful and established sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.</body></html>
