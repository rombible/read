The numbers are different in Samuel, which states them as 800,000 for Israel and 500,000 for Judah. The latter may fairly be regarded as a round number (500,000), our text giving the more exact total (470,000). As to the former, we may assume that the 1,100,000 of our text is an error of transcription, or, more probably, that the traditions respecting this census varied, as may easily have happened, inasmuch as the numbers were not registered in the royal archives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-24.htm" title="Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.">1Chronicles 27:24</a>). Perhaps, however, our estimate includes the standing army of David, reckoned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/27-1.htm" title="Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:1-15</a>) at a total of 288,000 men (in round numbers, 300,000); thus 800,000 (Sam.) + 300,000 = 1,100.000 (Chron.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The report of the numbers as given in this verse does <span class="accented">not</span> tally with that of the parallel place. Here they are three hundred thousand more for Israel, and thirty thousand fewer for Judah, than there. No really satisfactory explanation of these discrepancies has yet appeared. The somewhat ingenious suggestion that the Chronicle-compiler counted in the standing army (two hundred and eighty-eight thousand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</a>) for Israel, and omitted from Judah a supposed "thirty thousand," under the head of "the thirty" of our ch. 11; while the writer of the Book of Samuel did exactly the converse, - can scarcely pass muster, although it must be noticed that it would meet in the main the exigencies of the case. A likelier suggestion might be found in a comparison of the statements of our ver. 6 compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-22.htm">1 Chronicles 27:22-24</a>. Indeed, the last sentence of this last-quoted verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a>) may possibly contain the explanation of all (cutup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-47.htm">Numbers 1:47-50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-33.htm">Numbers 2:33</a>). That Joab utterly refused to number Levi, because this was a thing most distinctly prohibited (and further because it was not material to David's presumable objects), was quite to be expected. And though Joab is said in the following verse not to have numbered Benjamin, it is possible enough that he may have known this number (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6-11</a>). Yet see what follows. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.</body></html>
