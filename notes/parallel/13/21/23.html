Ornan's prompt offer of gift was, perhaps, all the prompter from the desire to render every assistance to the staying of the plague. <span class="cmt_word">For burnt offerings ... for the meat offering.</span> The whole code of regulations for offerings - sin offering, trespass offering, peace offering, burnt offering, meat and drink offering - is to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-7</a>. As regards the <span class="accented">burnt offering</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-8.htm">Leviticus 6:8-13</a>. It was called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from its "ascending" accepted to heaven, or else from its being put up or raised up (Hiph. conjugation) on the altar; and sometimes <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>, from being "wholly" consumed. The sin and trespass offerings were for special sins, but this was of a more comprehensive kind and of much greater dignity, as standing for the "purging of the conscience." The entire consuming of the sacrifice signified the unqualified self-surrender of him who brought the sacrifice. It was a voluntary offering, the offerer laid his hand on the head of the victim, and the blood of the victim was sprinkled round about the altar. <span class="accented">The meat offering</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is fully described in Leviticus it.; Leviticus 6:14-23. It was an offering without blood, and therefore was an accompaniment of an offering of blood. It was composed of flour or cakes, prepared with salt, oil, and frank-incense - the salt emblematic of non-decay; the oil, of spiritual grace; and the frankincense, of acceptable fragrance. A portion of this offering was to be burnt, and a portion eaten by the priests in the court, unless it was for a priest himself, when all must be burnt. Meantime a drink offering of wine was, in fact, a part of the meat offering itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40, 41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4-7, 9, 10</a>). The material of the meat offering might be the green or fresh-gathered ears of corn. The Septuagint translates <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; Luther, <span class="accented">speis-opfer</span>; and it need scarcely be said that our Authorized Version <span class="accented">meat</span> offering exhibits only the generic employment of the word "meat" for food. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.</body></html>
