The two estimates are obviously discordant. We have no means of calculating what would have been a fair price, for we know neither the extent of the purchase nor the value of the sums mentioned. But comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>, where four hundred shekels of silver are paid for the field and cave of Machpelah, fifty shekels of silver would seem to be too little. On the other hand, six hundred shekels of gold appears to be far too high a price for the threshingfloor. Perhaps for "gold" we should read "silver." It has, indeed, been suggested that "the authors were writing of two different things," and that Samuel assigns only the price of the threshingfloor and oxen; whereas the chronicler, when he speaks of "the place," means the entire Mount of the Temple (Moriah), on which the floor was situate. But a comparison of the two narratives seems to identify the things purchased--"the place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-25.htm" title="So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.">1Chronicles 21:25</a>) is "the place of the threshingfloor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-22.htm" title="Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar therein to the LORD: you shall grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.">1Chronicles 21:22</a>); and in both cases Samuel has "the threshingfloor." Tradition may have varied on the subject; and as "there is no positive mention of the use of gold money among the Hebrews" apart from this passage (<span class= "ital">Madden</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> ours is probably the later form of the story. However this may be, the chronicler has doubtless preserved for us what he found in his original. It is interesting to compare with this sale some of those the records of which are preserved in the Babylonian Contract Tablets. One of these relates how <span class= "ital">D?n-sum-iddin</span> sold a house and grounds in Borsippa for eleven and a-half minae of silver, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> 690 shekels. This was in the second year of Nabonidus the last king of Babylon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Six hundred shekels of gold by weight</span>. The only way to reconcile this statement with that of the parallel place, which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>)speaks of "fifty shekels of silver" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> taking the shekel at 2s. 8d., equal to about &pound;6 13s. 4d.) as the price of "the <span class="accented">threshing-floor and the oxen</span>," is to suppose that the fifty shekels speak of the purchase money of the oxen indeed, but not of the floor itself, which was valuable, not only for size and situation, but also for its prepared construction; or again, keeping to the literal language of Samuel, that "the floor and the oxen" are intended, while our expression, "the place," may designate the whole hill. The value of gold as compared with silver was as sixteen to one. If this be the solution, we should have again an instance of the compiler of this book seizing for perpetuation the point of greatest and most permanent interest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the purchase of the <span class="accented">whole</span> place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.</body></html>
