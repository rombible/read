Samuel has the reading "seven," which perhaps originated in some scribe's memory of the famine described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-30.htm" title="And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;">Genesis 41:30</a>, <span class= "ital">sqq.</span><p><span class= "bld">To be destroyed.</span>--Samuel has, "thy flying," and so LXX. and Vulg. here.

Samuel has simply, "and he pursuing thee." Perhaps the right text is, <span class= "ital">and he pursue thee to overtaking.</span> (Comp. the Syriac here: "Three months thou shalt be subdued before thy enemy, and he shall be pursuing thee, and he shall be mastering thee.")<p><span class= "bld">Or else three days the sword of the Lord . . . coasts of Israel.</span>--Samuel has the brief, "Or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land." Our text appears to be an exegetical expansion of the older statement. Others suppose it to be the original, of which Samuel is an epitome, alleging that otherwise "the angel" is introduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2Samuel 24:16</a> quite suddenly and abruptly. But we must remember that in the thought of those times pestilence and "the sword," or <span class= "ital">"</span>angel of the Lord," would be suggestive of each other. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm" title="And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">2Kings 19:35</a>; and for the three judgments, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-17.htm" title="So will I send on you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you: and pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword on you.

The parallel place has, in our Hebrew text, "seven" instead of "three." But the Septuagint indicates this to be but a corruption of a later text; for it reads" three," as here. The parallel place shows no mention of the destroying angel here spoken cf. The three inflictions of famine, sword, pestilence, are found not unfrequently elsewhere in Scripture (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-21.htm">Deuteronomy 28:21-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now ... advise thyself</span>. The simple text is" Now see," in place of "Now know and see" of the parallel passage. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>21:1-30 David's numbering the people. - No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter of Uriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needful connexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me, therefore I will still expect to meet him.</body></html>
