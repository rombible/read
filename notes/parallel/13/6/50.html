The third son of Aaron (by Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, and descended from Judah through Pharez) is the sea whose descendants are given here, inasmuch as he was appointed chief of the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-32.htm">Numbers 3:32</a>); ministered as a priest with his brother Ithamar, even before the death of Aaron; and succeeded him as high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-28.htm">Numbers 20:28</a>). It was in Eleazar's family that the high priesthood remained (as above) till the time of Eli, who was descended from Ithamar, and it returned again to the line of Eleazar in Zadok, fulfilling the intimation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
