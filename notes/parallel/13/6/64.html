This is clearly a summing up of the whole account so far. The eleven tribes have all been mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-61.htm" title="And to the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities.">1Chronicles 6:61-65</a>.<p>The "cities" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-64.htm" title="And the children of Israel gave to the Levites these cities with their suburbs.">1Chronicles 6:64</a> are those included in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-61.htm" title="And to the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities.">1Chronicles 6:61-63</a>. So the parallel verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-8.htm" title="And the children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.">Joshua 21:8</a>) refers back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/21-5.htm" title="And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.">Joshua 21:5-7</a>, which is parallel to our <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-61.htm" title="And to the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities.">1Chronicles 6:61-63</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-9.htm" title="And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name.">Joshua 21:9</a> (=our <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-65.htm" title="And they gave by lot out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, and out of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, these cities, which are called by their names.">1Chronicles 6:65</a>) <span class= "ital">introduces</span> the names of the cities which fell to the Aaronites.

The chronicler adds Benjamin, with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-60.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin; Geba with her suburbs, and Alemeth with her suburbs, and Anathoth with her suburbs. All their cities throughout their families were thirteen cities.">1Chronicles 6:60</a>, to make his tribal list complete.<p>(66?81) The names of the cities numbered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-61.htm" title="And to the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities.">1Chronicles 6:61-64</a>.

The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
