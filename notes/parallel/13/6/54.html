But the omission and the alteration of individual names of places occasion some delay. Our ver. 55 is given somewhat more fully in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-11.htm">Joshua 21:11</a>; our ver. 56 is identical with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12</a>; and our vers. 57-60 correspond substantially with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13-19</a>, but from this latter source we are glad to supply the two names Juttah and Gibeon, without which we cannot add up correctly the <span class="cmt_word">thirteen cities</span> of ver. 60. Also in Joshua, our <span class="cmt_word">Hilen, Ashan</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Alemsth</span> appear as <span class="accented">Holon</span>, <span class="accented">Ain</span>, and <span class="accented">Almon</span> respectively, although in regard to the intermediate name of these three the places cannot be accepted as identical, for they are mentioned side by side in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>, but we must admit an error involved. Ver. 56 (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-14.htm">Joshua 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12</a>). Ver. 61 seems to be an anticipation of vers. 66-70, with which verses, if we incorporate it, we shall obtain substantially the same results as are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-5.htm">Joshua 21:5, 20-26</a>; but again we are glad of the latter source to supply for us the two places, Eltekeh and Gibbethon, necessary to enable us to count up the <span class="cmt_word">ten cities</span> of our ver. 61, while our <span class="cmt_word">Jokmeam, Aner</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Bileam</span> appear as probably the corrected readings of <span class="accented">Kibzaim</span>, <span class="accented">Tanach</span>, and <span class="accented">Gath-rimmon</span> respectively in Joshua. The sons of Kohath.., left (ver. 61), the residue (Authorized Version, ver. 66), the remnant (ver. 70), point (as above) to the non-priestly descendants in the Kohath line. Summing up, we see that the Kohathite <span class="accented">priests</span> had thirteen cities from the allotments of Judah and Simeon and Benjamin, and the Ko-hathite non-priests had ten, from Ephraim, Dan, and West Manasseh. One might detect in all this some germ of the more modern parochial system, so far at least as regards the distributed residence of a clerical and ministerial order, though not with sacred buildings similarly distributed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
