Their Levitical descent is shown in the genealogies here traced up from themselves to Levi. First we have the pedigree of Heman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="And these are they that waited with their children. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman a singer, the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel,">1Chronicles 6:33-38</a>) the Kohathite.<p><span class= "bld">Heman a singer.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the singer</span> or <span class= "ital">minstrel.</span> Heman, as representing the chief branch of the Levites, is <span class= "ital">primus inter pares</span> as regards the other master singers. His choir occupied the centre, having on its right that of the Gershonite Asaph, on its left that of the Merarite Ethan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-39.htm" title="And his brother Asaph, who stood on his right hand, even Asaph the son of Berachiah, the son of Shimea,">1Chronicles 6:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm" title="And their brothers the sons of Merari stood on the left hand: Ethan the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch,">1Chronicles 6:44</a>), so that Heman would conduct the whole body of musicians, when the three choirs chanted in concert. The word "minstrel" is more appropriate than "singer" because the original term (<span class= "ital">ham'shor?r</span>) implies singing which the singer himself accompanies with an instrument of music. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-6.htm" title="All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.">1Chronicles 25:6</a>; LXX., <span class= "greekheb">? ????????</span><span class= "ital">.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Son of Joel, the son of Shemuel.</span>--It is interesting to learn that Heman, the great minstrel, was a grandson of Samuel the great prophet. (For the connection between music and prophecy, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-15.htm" title="But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came on him.">2Kings 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5-6</a>; and below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm" title="Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:">1Chronicles 25:1</a>, Note.) Considering that some have denied that Samuel was a Levite, the point of contact here noted looks like an undesigned coincidence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - We have now the name and pedigree of each of the three chief singers or musicians (their duty was both vocal and instrumental) of David's appointment, beginning, according to the analogy of ver. 2, <span class="accented">supra</span>, with Heman, the descendant of Kohath, instead of Asaph from Gershom. So the place of Heman was still the place of honor, in the centre, with Asaph on the right and Ethan on the left (vers. 39, 44). <span class="cmt_word">Heman</span> is the twenty-first according to this list (vers. 33-38) after Levi, but the genealogy is indistinct (see above, vers. 22-28) between <span class="cmt_word">Shemuel</span> and Assir, and according to Hervey ('Genealogies of our Lord,' p. 214), Heman comes fourteenth after Levi. This Heman is to be distinguished from Heman the "son of Zerah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>), and with but little doubt, therefore, from Heman the Ezrahite (Zerahite) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>. On the other hand, a theory has been suggested by Lord Arthur C. Hervey which might reconcile the two. He supposes that if Heman the Kohathite (or his father) had married an heiress of the house of Zerah, he might have become reckoned in the line of Zerah as well as in that of Kohath. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
