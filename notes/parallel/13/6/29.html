(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-20.htm" title="And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers.">Numbers 3:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-14.htm" title="And Azariah begat Seraiah, and Seraiah begat Jehozadak,">1Chronicles 6:14</a>, <span class= "ital">supra,</span> for the two sons of Merari, Mahli and Mushi, after whom the clans of the Merarites were designated. The present list traces the line of Mahli to the seventh generation; all the names are alike unknown. Below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-44.htm" title="And their brothers the sons of Merari stood on the left hand: Ethan the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch,">1Chronicles 6:44-47</a>, we have another line going back to Mushi, brother of Mahli. Why has the chronicler preserved the three lists of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-19.htm" title="The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. And these are the families of the Levites according to their fathers.">1Chronicles 6:19-30</a>? The process from Levi to the worthless sons of Samuel, and the utterly unknown names of Jeaterai and Asaiah, reads like an anti-climax. But it is not to be forgotten that these no longer significant fragments are genuine relics of ancient family registers, and as such may have had more than a merely antiquarian value in the days of the chronicler.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-31.htm" title="And these are they whom David set over the service of song in the house of the LORD, after that the ark had rest.">1Chronicles 6:31-32</a> are a prelude to the pedigrees of Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, the three great masters of David's choirs (33-48). The nature, time, and place of their special duties are described.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - (C) In ver. 19 the two sons of Merari, viz. Mahli and Mushi, are given. Here one of them, <span class="cmt_word">Mahli</span>, is repeated, with six descendants, of no one of whom have we any other information. From comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-20.htm">Numbers 3:20</a> and Numbers 26:58 there can be no doubt that Mahli and Mushi were brothers, each of whom founded a family. The descending line of Mushi, unalluded to here, comes to the surface in vers. 44-47. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
