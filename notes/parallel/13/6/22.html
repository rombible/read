As the text stands we have here a threefold list, each portion of which is isolated from the rest, and begins afresh with the word <span class= "ital">one</span> (the sons of).<p>(22) <span class= "bld">Amminadab his son.</span>--Amminadab is not mentioned as a son of Kohath in the Pentateuch or elsewhere. Korah, here called son of Amminadab, is called son of <span class= "ital">Izhar,</span> son of Kohath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-21.htm" title="And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.">Exodus 6:21</a>. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-18.htm" title="And the sons of Kohath were, Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.">1Chronicles 6:18</a>, <span class= "ital">supra,</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-38.htm" title="The son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, the son of Israel.">1Chronicles 6:38</a>, <span class= "ital">infra.</span>) Some assume that Amminadab is a "by-name" of Izhar (so Margin). It is more likely that the name Izhar has dropped out of the text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-22.htm" title="The sons of Kohath; Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,">1Chronicles 6:22</a>.<p>(22, 23) <span class= "bld">Assir his son, Elkanah his son, and</span> <span class= "bld">Ebiasaph his son.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-24.htm" title="And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.">Exodus 6:24</a> : "And the sons of Korah, Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph, these are the sons of Korah." The connection, then, is as follows:--<p>The conjunction <span class= "ital">and,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-23.htm" title="Elkanah his son, and Ebiasaph his son, and Assir his son,">1Chronicles 6:23</a>, seems to hint that the connection is no longer one of direct descent, but that the three, Assir, Elkanah, and Ebiasaph, are to be regarded as brothers.<p>(23) <span class= "bld">And Assir his son.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-37.htm" title="The son of Tahath, the son of Assir, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah,">1Chronicles 6:37</a> below, in the line of Heman, which in great part coincides with the present series. There we read, "Assir, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah." The present Assir is therefore son of Ebiasaph, and nephew of the former Assir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-22.htm" title="The sons of Kohath; Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,">1Chronicles 6:22</a>). The form of a direct descent is now resumed and continued with Tahath, son of Assir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-24.htm" title="Tahath his son, Uriel his son, Uzziah his son, and Shaul his son.">1Chronicles 6:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-28.</span> - (B) These verses give descendants, probably twenty-one in number, from Levi, through his second son, Kohath, to Joel, eldest son of Samuel and (ver. 33) father of Heman. The descendants of Kohath through his eldest son, Amram, have been given from vers. 3-15. But the descendants now to he spoken of are through another son, here called Am-minadab, a name not appearing among the four of ver. 2, but apparently standing for the Izhar of that verse. For he is said to have a son Korah, by whom, indeed, the genealogy moves on, while in vers. 37, 38. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a>, Korah is said to be the son of Izhar. Without the occurrence of this clue, we should have been at a loss to tell who Amminadab was, as we are now at a loss to explain the unexplained substitution of this new name. The Vatican Septuagint has Amminadab, while the Alexandrine has altered to Izhar, probably deeming the other name a mere error. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Korah</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-27.htm">Numbers 16:27, 32, 33</a>, with Numbers 26:9-11). From <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-24.htm">Exodus 6:24</a> we also learn that the throe next in lineal succession to Korah, were Assir, Elkanah, and Ebiasaph, or Abiasaph; though Elkanah and Assir are omitted from ver. 37, in the ascending line. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
