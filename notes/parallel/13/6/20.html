The question is whether this list of seven is part of the longer list of thirteen from Gershom (vers. 39-43). terminating with Asaph; and it seems impossible to decide the question satisfactorily. From the occurrence of the name Shimei in this latter, though in the wrong place, viz. after Jahath in the descending order, instead of before him, some think, Keil and Zockler among them, that it is a line from Shimei, the <span class="accented">brother</span> of Libni, and second son of Gershom. If this be so, the occurrence of three names, the same and in the same order, is a thing to be remarked, though possible enough in itself. But if not, then either the names <span class="cmt_word">Joah, Iddo, Jeaterai</span>, in the former list, must be interchangeable with <span class="accented">Ethan</span>, <span class="accented">Adaiah</span>, <span class="accented">Ethni</span>, respectively in the latter (a thing which the similarity of the Hebrew letters might render credible), while the Shimei of ver. 42 is omitted from ver. 20, and the Libni of ver. 20 from ver. 43; or the one list must pick up some links and leave others, and the other do likewise, whilst those taken the <span class="accented">same by both</span> are in the minority. This last supposition may be the more probable, though not free from difficulty. Zimmah. Beside the uncertainty of the identity of this Zimmah with the same name in ver. 42, it is very remarkable that we find a Zimmah, <span class="accented">also father of a Joah</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-12.htm">2 Chronicles 29:12</a>; also in this same passage we find three other reproductions of a similar kind <span class="accented">- father</span> and son-of what have first been found in this sixth chapter, viz. "Mahath, son of Amasai" (ver. 35); "Joel, son of Azariah" (ver. 36); "Kish, son of Abdi" (ver. 44). It seems as though the individual descendant was quoted in these instances by the name of the ancestor at a certain point. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
