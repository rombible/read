Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman a singer, the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel,">1Chronicles 6:33-34</a> that Samuel (Shemuel, <span class= "ital">name of God</span>) is son of Elkanah, son of Jeroham; hence we might suppose that the clause "Samuel his son" has been accidentally omitted at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-27.htm" title="Eliab his son, Jeroham his son, Elkanah his son.">1Chronicles 6:27</a>. But it is quite possible that the writer assumed the connection to be too well known to require specification, or that he has here thrown together three independent genealogical fragments. Comp. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-27.htm" title="Eliab his son, Jeroham his son, Elkanah his son.">1Chronicles 6:27-28</a> the pedigree of Elkanah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1Samuel 1:1</a> : "Elkanah son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph." Here again the names vary, yet not so as to obliterate their identity. Elihu ("<span class= "ital">El</span> is He") = Eliab, Eliel; Tohu, a fuller form of Toah = Nahath.<p><span class= "bld">The firstborn Vashni, and Abiah.</span>--Vashni is not a proper name, but a corrupt form of the Hebrew phrase "and the second" (<span class= "ital">sh?ni, secundus</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The sons of the prophet Samuel were Joel, the firstborn, and Abiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-2.htm" title="Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.">1Samuel 8:2</a> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="And these are they that waited with their children. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman a singer, the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel,">1Chronicles 6:33</a> below). Joel has fallen out of the text here; it should run, "Joel the firstborn, and the second Abiah."<p>Reviewing the Kohathite list (22-28) we conclude that it represents three statistical fragments which have been put in juxtaposition by the chronicler or the author whom he has followed, and that in accordance with the real connection between the members, as appears on comparison with the continuous list which immediately follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="And these are they that waited with their children. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman a singer, the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel,">1Chronicles 6:33-38</a>. The fact that "Samuel his son" is the missing link between <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-27.htm" title="Eliab his son, Jeroham his son, Elkanah his son.">1Chronicles 6:27-28</a>, makes it likely that "Elkanah his son" is the true connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-24.htm" title="Tahath his son, Uriel his son, Uzziah his son, and Shaul his son.">1Chronicles 6:24-25</a>.<p>From Levi to the sons of Samuel about twenty generations are reckoned. Usher's chronology dates the descent of Jacob and his sons into Egypt at 1706 B.C. Twenty generations are six hundred years. The sons of Samuel would, according to this, be living about 1106 B.C. and later. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ruth/4-18.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,">Ruth 4:18-22</a> reckons only ten generations from Judah to Jesse, the father of David. This again shows that in their genealogical tables the Hebrews did not uniformly supply every link, but were often content with a statement of the principal names.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
