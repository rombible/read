It was given to David to settle the ark after its travels through the wilderness, its sojourn in various places since then, doubtless always within the care of some Levitical family (except when taken by enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5, 6</a>.), and in especial its prolonged twenty years' sojourn at Kirjath-jearim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-3.htm">1 Chronicles 13:3-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-1.htm">1 Chronicles 15:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-5.htm">1 Chronicles 17:5</a>). It now had rest, though its place of rest was only within "curtains" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a special separate tent prepared for it by David, which tent was probably the suggestion, and as it were the nucleus, of the coming grand temple itself - the house of God. The event was naturally one of great joy and thanksgiving, of which David himself was the chief leader (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-1.htm">1 Chronicles 16:1-3</a>); but it appears also that it furnished the occasion of appointing fixed choir conductors, leaders of the service of song" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-4.htm">1 Chronicles 16:4-7, 37, 41, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-7</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
