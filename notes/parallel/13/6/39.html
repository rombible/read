That of Heman names twenty ancestors for the same period of time. This is one more illustration of the common usage of overleaping names in these genealogies.<p>(39) <span class= "bld">His brother Asaph.</span>--Asaph was Heman's brother (1) as a Levite; (2) as a choir-master.<p>The striking agreement of the line of Heman with that of the Kohathites, detailed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-22.htm" title="The sons of Kohath; Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,">1Chronicles 6:22-28</a> above, has led critics to look for a like coincidence between the line of Asaph as given here, and that of the Gershonites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-20.htm" title="Of Gershom; Libni his son, Jahath his son, Zimmah his son,">1Chronicles 6:20-21</a>. There, however, we have only seven names, here there are thirteen. Still we observe that in the former passage the three names, Jahath, Zimmah, and Zerah appear in <span class= "ital">the same order of lineal descent</span> from Gershon as in the present list; while the Adaiah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-41.htm" title="The son of Ethni, the son of Zerah, the son of Adaiah,">1Chronicles 6:41</a> obviously answers to the Iddo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-21.htm" title="Joah his son, Iddo his son, Zerah his son, Jeaterai his son.">1Chronicles 6:21</a>, and Ethni (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-41.htm" title="The son of Ethni, the son of Zerah, the son of Adaiah,">1Chronicles 6:41</a>) is in Hebrew writing not unlike Jeaterai; and we are already familiar with the fact that genealogies sometimes recur in abbreviated forms. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/7-1.htm" title="Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,">Ezra 7:1-5</a>, with the line of Aaron in the present chapter.) Upon the whole, therefore, if the suggested identifications be correct, it appears that Asaph's pedigree has really been partially anticipated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-20.htm" title="Of Gershom; Libni his son, Jahath his son, Zimmah his son,">1Chronicles 6:20-21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Asaph</span> is called <span class="cmt_word">brother</span> of Heman, either as brother in office or generally as relative in the degree of cousin by many removes. He stands fourteenth in line of descent after Levi, while Ethan (ver. 44) stands thirteenth. If the line of Heman (as given in vers. 33-38) were <span class="accented">correct.</span> it would force on us the conviction that there are several omissions in these two lines; but if these are correct, we must conclude that there are unwarranted additions in the other. On the names of Asaph's ancestors, see notes on vers. 20, 21. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a> it seems plain that Asaph was himself a composer of psalms, and not simply either the musician or rehearser of those of David. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
