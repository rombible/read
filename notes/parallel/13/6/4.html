From this name inclusive follow the twenty-two, which terminate with Jehozadak, who indeed never attained him s elf to the office of high priest, but was son of Geraiah, last high priest before the Captivity, and father of Jeshua, high priest, who returned with Zerubbabel from the Captivity. It has been pointed out by Lord A. C. Hervey that the name Jehozadak is of the same meaning with Zedekiah, the last king before the Captivity; and that Jeshua is the same in meaning with Joshua, the leader of the tribes into Canaan. The two elder brothers of Eleazar, viz. Nadab and Abihu, died without issue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-28.htm">Numbers 20:28</a>; ch. 24:1-3). It is somewhat obscurely said that the sacred office remained in the family of Eleazar till, in the person of Eli, it passed awhile into that of Ithamar, his brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26, 27</a>; Josephus, 8:1, &sect; 3), to be recovered again in the Zadok of our ver. 9 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Phinehas</span>; a memorable man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-30.htm">Psalm 106:30, 31</a>; which Grove well compares with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abishua</span>; only mentioned in this chapter and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1-5</a>. Josephus (8:1, &sect; 3) asserts that he it was who was succeeded in the high priesthood, not by any one of his own descendants, but by Eli, till Zedok, in the time of David, all the intervening members of the Eleazar family being private individuals. But no reliance can be placed on this assertion, for see Josephus again (5:11, &sect; 5). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>6:1-81 Genealogies. - We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.</body></html>
