Light is thrown upon this by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>, which says that Abigail was the daughter of one Nahash, and that Zeruiah was her sister. But it is to leave us in greater darkness as to who Nahath was: whether Nahath was another name for Jesse, or the name of Jesse's wife, or the name of a former husband of Jesse's wife, to whom she bore these two daughters before she became wife to Jesse, and that former husband possibly none other than the Ammonite king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>) - or whether none of these conjectures be near the truth, some of which on the face of them seem unlikely enough, is as yet unsettled. Meantime it is worth remembering that Zeruiah named one of her celebrated sons, and probably the eldest of them, <span class="cmt_word">Abishai</span>, after Jesse, Ishai being the same as our Jesse; yet from the above premises it is taken that she was strictly sister of Abigail, and therefore was not really related to Jesse. The subject is treated interestingly under the various names in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary.' The husband of Zeruiah is given nowhere, while the husband of Abigail, here called <span class="cmt_word">Jether the Ishmeelite</span>, is, in the passage already referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>), called Ithra (which is a slightly altered form of the name), an <span class="accented">Israelite</span>, with little doubt an error for <span class="accented">Ishmaelite.</span> In the same passage also her own name appears as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, though many manuscripts have this latter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.</body></html>
