The men of Zorah and Eshtaol were subdivisions of the clans of Kirjath-jearim. Zorah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm" title="And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.">Judges 13:2</a>), a Danite town, the home of Samson, now <span class= "ital">Sura.</span> Eshtaol, also a Danite town, near Zorah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-31.htm" title="Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial plot of Manoah his father.

The recognition of the ethnographical and geographical significance of these expressions at once removes all difficulty. Salma was the principal clan established in Bethlehem-Ephratah; branches of which were settled at Netophah, a neighbouring township (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-16.htm" title="And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelled in the villages of the Netophathites.">1Chronicles 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/23-28.htm" title="Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,">2Samuel 23:28-29</a>), important after the return (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-22.htm" title="The men of Netophah, fifty and six.">Ezra 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-26.htm" title="The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, an hundred fourscore and eight.">Nehemiah 7:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ataroth, the house of Joab.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Atroth-beth-Joab</span> (comp. Abel-beth-Maachah); an unknown town, whose name means "ramparts of the house of Joab," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "Joab's castle," perhaps a strong city where Joab's family was settled. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-26.htm" title="Jerahmeel had also another wife, whose name was Atarah; she was the mother of Onam.">1Chronicles 2:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Half of the Manahethites</span> were sons of Salma, the other half sons of Shobal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-52.htm" title="And Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim had sons; Haroeh, and half of the Manahethites.">1Chronicles 2:52</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The Zorites.</span>--A by-form of Zorathites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-53.htm" title="And the families of Kirjathjearim; the Ithrites, and the Puhites, and the Shumathites, and the Mishraites; of them came the Zareathites, and the Eshtaulites,">1Chronicles 2:53</a>). The word really belongs to the next verse, as the sons of Salma are arranged in pairs.<p>(55) <span class= "bld">The families</span> (<span class= "ital">mishpehoth=</span>clans) <span class= "bld">of the scribes which dwelt at Jabez.</span>--Among the clans calling themselves sons of Salma were three groups of Sopherim (Authorised version, "scribes") settled at Jabez (Heb., <span class= "ital">Ia'bec</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> a town of northern Judah, near to Zorah. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-9.htm" title="And Jabez was more honorable than his brothers: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bore him with sorrow.">1Chronicles 4:9</a>, Note.) The three clans were known as those of Tir'ah, Shimeah, and Suchah. The Vulg. treats these names as appellatives, and renders <span class= "ital">canentes atque resonantes et in tabernaculis commorantes,</span> that is, "singing and resounding, and dwelling in tents." This translation is assumed to be due to Jerome's Rabbinical teachers, and is justified by reference to the words <span class= "ital">ter-'?h,</span> "trumpet-blare;" <span class= "ital">shim'?h,</span> "report;" or the Aramaic <span class= "ital">Shema'ta</span> "legal tradition" and <span class= "ital">s-k?h</span> (= <span class= "ital">sukkah</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> "a booth." Hence the conclusion has been drawn that the Sopherim of Jabez were, in fact, ministers of religion, discharging functions precisely like those of the Levites. So Wellhausen, who refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.">Jeremiah 35:19</a>, and the title of Psalms 70 in the LXX., and to one or two late fragmentary notices of the Rechabites. On the face of it the supposition is unlikely; nor does it derive any real support from the Kenite origin of these Sopherim, for it is a mere fancy that the house of Jethro, the Kenite priest of Midian, became temple-ministers in Israel. Besides, the etymologies of the names are hardly cogent; and if we try to extract history from etymology here, we might as well do so in the case of the clans of Kirjath-jearim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-53.htm" title="And the families of Kirjathjearim; the Ithrites, and the Puhites, and the Shumathites, and the Mishraites; of them came the Zareathites, and the Eshtaulites,">1Chronicles 2:53</a>), and make the Ithrites a guild of ropers (<span class= "ital">yether,</span> "cord, bowstring"), the Puthites hinge-makers (<span class= "ital">pothoth</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm" title="And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.">1Kings 1:50</a>--"hinges"), and the Shumathithes garlic-eaters (<span class= "ital">sh-m,</span> "garlic," <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-5.htm" title="We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:">Numbers 11:5</a>). The Vulg. often makes the blunder of translating proper names. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-52.htm" title="And Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim had sons; Haroeh, and half of the Manahethites.">1Chronicles 2:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-54.htm" title="The sons of Salma; Bethlehem, and the Netophathites, Ataroth, the house of Joab, and half of the Manahethites, the Zorites.">1Chronicles 2:54</a>).<p><span class= "bld">These are the Kenites that came of Hemath</span> (Heb., <span class= "ital">Hammath</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> <span class= "bld">the father of the house of</span> (Beth-) <span class= "bld">Rechab.</span>--The three clans of Sopherim were originally Kenites, and traced their descent from Hammath, the traditional founder of the Rechabite stock. When, or under what circumstances these Rechabite Kenites amalgamated with the Calebite clan of Salma is unknown; but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-11.htm" title="And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:">Judges 1:11-16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 50-55.</span> - The opening sentence of these verses has also been already discussed.

This rendering is got at by altering "the son of Hut" into "the sons of Hur," which seems to have been the reading of the Septuagint manuscripts, and which, at all events, their rendering has.
