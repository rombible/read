The text is evidently corrupt. The best suggestion is based on the reading of the LXX.: <span class= "greekheb">??? ???? ?? ????????? ?????? ????? ????? ??? ??????</span>; "And after Hezron's death Caleb went to Ephrath." Some very slight changes in the Hebrew, affecting only three letters of the entire sentence, will give the sense, "And after Hezron's death Caleb went in to Ephrath, the wife of his father Hezron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-19.htm" title="And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took to him Ephrath, which bore him Hur.">1Chronicles 2:19</a>); and she bare him Ash-hur, father (founder, or chief) of Tekoa." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Israel dwelled in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:">Genesis 35:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Ashur</span> (Heb., <span class= "ital">Ash-hur</span>) means "man of Hur"--that is, the chief of the clan of the Hurites, settled at Ephrath or Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-19.htm" title="And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took to him Ephrath, which bore him Hur.">1Chronicles 2:19</a>). Comp. Ashbel "man of Bel." (<span class= "ital">Ash</span> is the elder form of <span class= "ital">Ish</span> "man"; as appears from the Phenician inscriptions.)<p>That "Caleb" in this verse means the house of Caleb is evident if we consider that the genealogy makes <span class= "ital">him</span> great grandson of Judah, whereas the individual Caleb son of Jephunneh took part in the conquest of Canaan, more than four centuries after Judah went down to Egypt.<p><span class= "bld">III.--The Jerahmeelites</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/2-25.htm" title="And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah.">1Chronicles 2:25-41</a>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-10.htm" title="And Achish said, Where have you made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.">1Samuel 27:10</a>, "the south (land) of the Jerahmeelites," in the territory of Judah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The remaining verse of this section brings another point of difficulty unsolved yet. No place <span class="cmt_word">Caleb-ephratah</span> is known, and no sort of accounting for Hezron dying anywhere but in Egypt, whither he went with Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>), is producible. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">Ingressus est Caleb ad Ephratam</span>, but our Hebrew text cannot be made to justify it, if for nothing else, for want of a preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> before "Ephrata." This reading of the Vulgate has suggested to others that by a slight but still gratuitous alteration of our Hebrew text <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> might be substituted for the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to the name of Caleb; but upon <span class="accented">that</span> showing we have to <span class="accented">suppose</span> that Caleb did leave Egypt on his own account and travel to Ephratah, and then there fails any strong connection (but see Septuagint, in <span class="accented">loc.</span>) between that fact and what is said about <span class="cmt_word">Abiah</span>. Still, the explanation might receive some countenance from the fact that it is said that Abiah's son became the father - or <span class="accented">founder - <span class="cmt_word"></span>of</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Tekoa</span>, a place near Bethlehem, in South Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). Bertheau has at this point suggested that Caleb-ephratah, instead of being included in Neger-Caleb, may rather, in <span class="accented">distinction</span> from it, designate the northern portion of the territory of Caleb. The solution of the problem will probably not yield to anything but a justly restored text. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.</body></html>
