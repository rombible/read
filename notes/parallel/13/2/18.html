The <span class= "ital">prima facie</span> rendering is, "And Caleb son of Hezron begat Azubah a woman, and Jerioth: and these (are) her sons; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon." But <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-19.htm" title="And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took to him Ephrath, which bore him Hur.">1Chronicles 2:19</a> continues: "And Azubah died, and Caleb took to himself (as wife) Ephrath," which of course suggests that Azubah was not daughter but a former wife of Caleb. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm" title="And Caleb the son of Hezron begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth: her sons are these; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon.">1Chronicles 2:18</a> has also been translated, "And Caleb son of Hezron caused Azubah a wife and Jerioth to bear children." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-9.htm" title="Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? said the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? said your God.">Isaiah 66:9</a>.) It seems best to read, "his wife, daughter of Jerioth ('i<span class= "ital">shto -bath.Ierioth</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> instead of the text (<span class= "ital">ishshah ve'eth Ierioth</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> and to render: And Caleb son of Hezron begat sons with Azubah daughter of Jerioth" (<span class= "ital">eth,</span> the particle before Azubah, is ambiguous, and might be either the mere sign of the accusative, or the prep. "with," <span class= "ital">cum, </span><span class= "greekheb">????</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The Syriac partly supports this version, for it reads: "And Caleb begat of Azubah, his wife, Jerioth," making Jerioth Azubah's daughter. The LXX. has, "And Caleb took Azubah a wife and Jerioth," which only shows that the corruption of the text is ancient.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-20.</span> - (C) Chelubai. The descendants of <span class="cmt_word">Caleb</span> (Chelubai), placed third of Hezron's sons, are next dealt with; but the subject is almost immediately interrupted by resumed reference to <span class="cmt_word">Hezron</span> (vers. 21-24), and by the table of Jemh-meel and his descendants (vers. 25-41); after which the table of Caleb, apparently the same Caleb, is carried on (vers. 42-49). Taking these broken portions, however, just as they come, we are immediately met by a series of uncertainties and surprises. Ver. 18 is obscure in that it says Caleb had children by <span class="cmt_word">Azubah</span> (the Hebrew construction also unusual), a <span class="cmt_word">wife</span>, or indeed strictly a <span class="accented">woman</span> (not even using the ordinary formula "his wife"), and by <span class="cmt_word">Jerioth</span>, of whom nothing is said; and the verse adds obscurity by saying, her sons are these, without plainly indicating to which woman reference is made. It may be safely presumed, however, from what follows, that Azubah is intended, though no other part of Scripture helps us By so much as a mention of the sons' names to determine it certainly. Meantime one Hebrew manuscript and the Chaldee Paraphrase are found to omit the words "and by Jerioth." The Vulgate, and the Syriac and Arabic versions, make Jerioth one of the <span class="accented">children -</span> possibly a daughter - of Caleb and Azubah, and this view is supported by Kennicott and Houbigant (Barrington's 'Genealogies,' 1:210). The tone of ver. 19 may certainly he held to offer some countenance to the assumption that either Jerioth's name ought to appear as that of a child or not at all. The name <span class="cmt_word">Ephrath</span> in this verse abounds with interest. The ancient name of the town of Bethlehem, and also apparently of a district round it, is the same word which is found here as the name of a woman. In either case it is more generally written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as even in the two other appearances of it in this very chapter. Two manuscripts, followed by two ancient editions, and apparently by the Vulgate, substitute <span class="accented">aleph</span> for the above final <span class="accented">he.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>, Bethlehem is found united with Ephratah in one compound word. The mother Ephrath is here interesting for her descendants given, her son <span class="cmt_word">Hur</span>, grandson <span class="cmt_word">Uri</span>, and great-grandson <span class="cmt_word">Bezaleel</span>. Further reference to these is made in ver. 50. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.</body></html>
