THE LINE OF JUDAH, TO HIS THREE GREAT-GRANDSONS. The line of Judah is, with a well-known object, the first to be taken up, although Judah stands fourth of Israel's sons. Judah has five sons: three, <span class="cmt_word">Er, Onan, Shelah</span>, by a Canaanitess, the daughter of <span class="cmt_word">Shad</span>; and two, <span class="cmt_word">Pharez</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Zerah</span>, by <span class="cmt_word">Tamar</span>, his own daughter-in-law, under the circumstances described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-6.htm">Genesis 38:6-30</a>). There all these names are found in exact accord in the Authorized Version, in the Hebrew text, and in the Septuagint. The Septuagint Version, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-2.htm">Genesis 38:2</a>), by an evident inaccuracy of translation, gives Shua as the name, not of the father, but of the daughter, <span class="greek">&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;</span>. Parallel passages are also found (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-19.htm">Numbers 26:19-22</a>). Er and Onan died without issue, and the descendants of <span class="accented">Shelah</span> are not mentioned till we reach <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-21.htm">1 Chronicles 4:21-23</a>. The line is now carried on by the twin sons of <span class="accented">Tamar</span> (vers. 5, 6). <span class="accented">Pharez</span>, with two sons, <span class="cmt_word">Hezron</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Hamul</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18</a>), and <span class="cmt_word">Zerah</span>, with five sons, <span class="cmt_word">Zimri</span> (or Zabdi, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>), <span class="cmt_word">Ethan, Heman, Calcol, Dara</span> (or with many manuscripts, followed by the Targum, Syriac, and Arabic versions, Darda). If these last four names are not identical with those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-31.htm">1 Kings 4:31</a>, they are not to be found in any available connection elsewhere, and the last two not at all. Upon this supposition, it is held by some that this very passage proves that the compiler drew on resources not possessed by us. The weight of evidence seems, however, largely in favour of the persons being the same. (See Gilbert Barrington's 'Old Testament Genealogies,' 1:206-208, well summarized in art. "Darda," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' for as competent a discussion of the question as the present data will allow.) It needs to be constantly remembered that an enumeration like the above, of five so-called <span class="accented">sons</span>, does not necessarily involve their being five <span class="accented">brothers</span>, although in this case it looks the more as though they were so, as it is said <span class="cmt_word">five of them in all</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.</body></html>
