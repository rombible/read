Evident stress is laid on his maternal descent. Thus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>) he is styled son of Manasseh, and hence also the explanation of the last clause of ver. 23, <span class="accented">infra</span>, all these belonged to <span class="cmt_word">the sons of Machir the father of Gilead</span>. Some of the cities alluded to are the Havoth-Jair (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>), Englished as the "groups of <span class="accented">dwellings</span> of Jair," on which see interesting note in Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine' (edit. 1866), vocabulary, pp. 526, 527. They lay in the trans-Jordanic district Trachonitis, the modern El-leyah and Jebel-Hauran. It is not possible to harmonize exactly the numbers of the cities given here with those in passages quoted above; nor is the translation of ver. 23, Authorized Version, very certainly the correct one. E. Bertheau, in his 'Die Bucher der Chronik erklart; 15. Kurzgef. exegetisches Handbuch. z. A.T.,' translates, "And Geshur and Aram took the Havvoth-Jair from them with Kenath and her daughter-towns, sixty cities." "Took" is supposed to mean here "retook," or "recovered." Though this suits the Hebrew syntax better, it does not suit so well our immediate context; nor have we any other information of such re, covering of them. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.</body></html>
