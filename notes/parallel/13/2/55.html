This sixth set of descendants from Salma is exhibited to us in the shape of a trio of scribe families, the heads of which will have been, presumably, <span class="cmt_word">Tira,</span> Shimea, and <span class="cmt_word">Suchah</span>. They are said to have <span class="cmt_word">dwelt at Jabez</span>, a place not ascertained; and scarcely to be put into connection with the Jabez of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-9.htm">1 Chronicles 4:9</a>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">translated</span> the names of these three families: <span class="accented">Canentes et resonantes et in tabernaculis commorantes</span>;" and Bertheau advocates the interpretation. These families, it appears, were not purely of Judah; but very interesting it is that, though of the people whose land and possessions were to yield to the descendants of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>), yet friendship and intermarriage had found them apparently a lasting place in Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), while Saul was careful to urge them to save themselves when he was about to smite the Amalekites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>). Though nothing is known of the link of connection given here in the name Hemath (of which the Vulgate gives the rendering, <span class="accented">Qui venerunt de celose patris</span>), yet the house of the <span class="cmt_word">Rechabites</span> is well known (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2, 5, 18</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-2.htm">2 Samuel 4:2</a>, particularly 3). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> In ver. 51 <span class="cmt_word">Hareph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>) only here; though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;</span>, found <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-24.htm">Nehemiah 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-20.htm">Nehemiah 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-18.htm">Ezra 2:18</a>, may possibly he connected with it. There is nothing further said of any people derived from him except that he was <span class="cmt_word">father of Beth-gader</span>. The identification of this place is not certain. Gesenius thinks it perhaps the same with Gederah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>), but it is more probably the Gedor of same chapter (fifty-eighth verse), on the road between Hebron and Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.</body></html>
