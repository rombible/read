The chronicler omits the mothers, and puts Dan before instead of after Joseph and Benjamin, as if to hint that Dan was considered Rachel's elder son.

Of course accident may have caused the transposition of Dan with Joseph and Benjamin in our list, especially as it otherwise agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/35-3.htm" title="And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.">Genesis 35:3-4</a>.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - 1. TABLE OF ISRAEL'S TWELVE SONS. The twelve sons of <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span>, not in the order of age (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31-30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-16.htm">Genesis 35:16-19</a>), nor exactly in the order of children of wives as against those of handmaids (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23-26</a>), nor in that of the aged father's dying blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>.), nor in that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-2.htm">Exodus 1:2-4</a>. It is the place of <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span> which disturbs the fittest order, and Keil suggests that his place in this text is accounted for by Rachel's desire that her handmaid's child should be accounted her own; but surely this was not exceptional, but applied to all or most of such cases, and should have been far rather taken into consideration in any of the other lists than in this. However accounted for, the order is - <span class="accented">lest</span>, the six sons of the first wife Leah; <span class="accented">secondly</span>, the elder son of Rachel's handmaid Bilhah; <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, the two sons of the loved wife Rachel; <span class="accented">fourthly</span>, the other son of Rachel's handmaid Billah; <span class="accented">lastly</span>, the two sons of Zilpah, handmaid of Leah. As this order corresponds with nothing in our Old Testament, it may serve as one slight indication that the compiler of Chronicles was not dependent on these records alone. The Hebrew text and the Septuagint accord exactly with the Authorized Version here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.</body></html>
