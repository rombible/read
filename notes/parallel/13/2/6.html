Both are genuine Hebrew names occurring elsewhere. But the fact that Zimri here, and Zabdi at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm" title="But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.">Joshua 7:1</a>, are both called sons of Zerah, seems to prove their identity; especially as m is often confused with <span class= "ital">b</span>, and <span class= "ital">d</span> with <span class= "ital">r.</span><p><span class= "bld">Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara.</span>--It is stated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-31.htm" title="For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.">1Kings 4:31</a>) that Solomon was "wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol." It will be seen that the first three names coincide with those of our text, and that Dara is only one letter different from Darda. Further, many MSS. of Chronicles, as well as the Svriac and Arabic versions and the Targum, actually have Darda. The Yatic. LXX. reads Darad. There is thus a virtual repetition of these four names in the passage of Kings, and it is difficult to suppose that the persons intended are not the same there and here. Ethan is called an Ezrahite in Kings, but Ezrah and Zerah are equivalent forms in Hebrew; and the Yatic. LXX. actually calls Ethan a Zarhite--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a descendant of Zerah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-13.htm" title="Of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites: of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites.">Numbers 26:13</a>). The designation of the four as "sons of Mahol" presents no difficulty. <span class= "ital">Mahol</span> is a usual word for the sacred dance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-3.htm" title="Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises to him with the tambourine and harp.">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-4.htm" title="Praise him with the tambourine and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.">Psalm 150:4</a>), and the four Zarhites are thus described as "sons of dancing"--that is, sacred musicians. It is likely, therefore, that these famous minstrels of Judah were adopted into the Levitical clans in which sacred music was the hereditary profession. (See Psalms 88, 89., titles.) Whether Ethan and Heman are the persons mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="And these are they that waited with their children. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman a singer, the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel,">1Chronicles 6:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm" title="And their brothers the sons of Merari stood on the left hand: Ethan the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch,">1Chronicles 6:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-17.htm" title="So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;">1Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm" title="So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;">1Chronicles 15:19</a> as the recognised heads of two of the great guilds of temple musicians is not clear. The Levitical ancestry ascribed to them in 1 Chronicles 6 would not be opposed to this assumption, as adoption would involve it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>2:1-55 Genealogies. - We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.</body></html>
