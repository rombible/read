Authorities are very divided as to whether this expression describes inhabitants of the land before the Captivity or subsequent to it. Almost all the older authorities, and Keil amongst those of more modern date, take the former position; Movers, Bertheau, and others take the latter, as also Canon Rawlinson ('Speaker's Commentary,' 3:157, 211). It must be admitted that there is some obscurity, and which accounts for the contrariety of opinion. But obscurity and contrariety notwithstanding, a comparison of vers. 2 and 3 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-4</a>: produces two impressions almost irresistible, viz. that the difficulty is occasioned by some comparatively slight corruption or mutilation in our ver. 2; and that, whatever the reference is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-4</a> (and there is no ambiguity there), that it is in the present passage. The fourfold classification intends the <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span> <span class="accented">people</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>), the <span class="cmt_word">priests</span>, the <span class="cmt_word">Levites</span>, the <span class="cmt_word">Nethinims</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those <span class="accented">given</span> as helpers of the priests, bond-men of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-18.htm">Numbers 8:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-47.htm">Numbers 31:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-40.htm">Ezra 2:40-48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-17.htm">Ezra 8:17, 20</a>). Not before the time of the return does the name Nethinim seem to have crystallized upon this class of helpers, the explanation of which may possibly be that their numbers and their services then became so much more necessary. To this classification is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3</a>, "And the children of Solomon's servants" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-55.htm">Ezra 2:55</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-44 Genealogies. - This chapter expresses that one end of recording all these genealogies was, to direct the Jews, when they returned out of captivity, with whom to unite, and where to reside. Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8. Blessed be His name, believers there shall, not in turn, but all together, without interruption, praise him night and day: may the Lord make each of us fit for the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
