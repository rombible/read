It is clear that the names of the porters likewise represent families or guilds, which had hereditary charge of the Temple gates. In fact, all the Levitical functions appear to have descended in the same families from father to son, like the various civil offices in the Roman empire; and tradition ascribed the entire arrangement to David, the second founder of the national worship. At this point the correspondence with Nehemiah 11 ceases.<p><span class= "bld">Shallum was the chief.</span>--This really belongs to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-18.htm" title="Who till now waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi.">1Chronicles 9:18</a>, and introduces a description of the duties of the Levites, which extends over <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/9-18.htm" title="Who till now waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi.">1Chronicles 9:18-34</a>.

Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.">1Chronicles 26:14</a>), which, again, is a curtailment of Meshelemiah ("Jah recompenseth"), <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm" title="Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.">1Chronicles 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-21.htm" title="And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">1Chronicles 9:21</a> <span class= "ital">infra.</span> The fact that Shallum--Meshelemiah--is spoken of as warder in David's day as well as in the post-exilic age, proves that a guild or clan, not an individual, is in question. The eastern gate was the post of honour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/46-1.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.">Ezekiel 46:1-2</a>), and the royal entry.

The word employed (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>) is used, however, generally of gate or door keepers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-26.htm">2 Samuel 17:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-16.htm">John 18:16</a>). Their number, stated in ver. 22 as two hundred and twelve, is probably corrected in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a> to one hundred and seventy-two, made up of twenty-four for every week (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-17.htm">1 Chronicles 26:17, 18</a>), "entering on the sabbath" upon their work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4</a>), in rotation for seven weeks, and the four "chief warders." For the five porters here mentioned there are only two mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a>, and neither of those Shallum, the chief. But see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-45.htm">Nehemiah 7:45</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>9:1-44 Genealogies. - This chapter expresses that one end of recording all these genealogies was, to direct the Jews, when they returned out of captivity, with whom to unite, and where to reside. Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8. Blessed be His name, believers there shall, not in turn, but all together, without interruption, praise him night and day: may the Lord make each of us fit for the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
