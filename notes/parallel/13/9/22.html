And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.">1Samuel 25:1</a>). Tradition doubtless associated him with David in the work of religious reform, and from what is known of his relation to the sovereigns of his day, the statement of the text may be held true in spirit, if not in the letter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seer</span>. It is to be noticed that the compiler of Chronicles uses elsewhere, as here, the "aforetime" name of the prophet, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>.

Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8. Blessed be His name, believers there shall, not in turn, but all together, without interruption, praise him night and day: may the Lord make each of us fit for the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
