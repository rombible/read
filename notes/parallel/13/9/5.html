The three sons of Judah, after whom three great sub-tribal divisions were named, were Pharez, Shelah, and Zarah (Genesis 38). The clan of Shelah was called the Shelanite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-20.htm" title="And the sons of Judah after their families were; of Shelah, the family of the Shelanites: of Pharez, the family of the Pharzites: of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites.">Numbers 26:20</a>), and that is doubtless the correct reading here (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-3.htm" title="The sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah: which three were born to him of the daughter of Shua the Canaanitess.

Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8. Blessed be His name, believers there shall, not in turn, but all together, without interruption, praise him night and day: may the Lord make each of us fit for the inheritance of the saints in light.</body></html>
