Either the phrase "heads of their father-houses" belongs to the last verse, and has been accidentally brought into its present position; or in this instance it means simply "heads of single families;" or "their brethren, heads of their (respective) clans," refers to other father-houses not mentioned by name, and the number 1,760 refers to all the guilds and clans of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/9-10.htm" title="And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,">1Chronicles 9:10-13</a>, and should be separated from the preceding phrase by a semicolon.

Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8.
