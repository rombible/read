It usually means the palace at Susa (comp. the Persian word <span class= "ital">baru,</span> "citadel"), and this is the only passage of Scripture in which it denotes the Temple. From its august associations, the word was well calculated to convey to the minds of the chronicler's contemporaries some idea of the magnificence of the Temple of Solomon as he imagined it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The anxiety which David felt on account of the youth of Solomon (repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>) evidently pressed heavily on him. The additional expression here is to be noticed, <span class="cmt_word">whom alone God hath chosen</span>. By this plea, full of truth as it was, we may suppose that David would shelter himself from any possible blame or reflection on the part of the people, from the charge of partiality on the part of his elder children, and any unjust slight to them, and also from any <span class="accented">self-reproach</span>, in that he was devolving such a responsible task on so <span class="cmt_word">young and tender</span> a man. <span class="cmt_word">Palace</span>. This word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), by which the temple is designated here and in ver. 19, seems to be very probably a word of Persian derivation. It is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>; but very frequently in Esther, where it is used not only of "Shushan the palace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-2.htm">Esther 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-3.htm">Esther 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>), as the royal abode, but also of the special part of the city adjoining the palace proper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-5.htm">Esther 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-6.htm">Esther 9:6</a>). The word is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; but there it carries the signification of the fortress of the temple. There may be some special appropriateness in its use here, in consideration of the circumstance of the fortifications and wall, which flanked the temple. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-9 What is done in works of piety and charity, should be done willingly, not by constraint; for God loves a cheerful giver. David set a good example. This David offered, not from constraint, or for show; but because he had set his affection to the house of God, and thought he could never do enough towards promoting that good work. Those who would draw others to good, must lead the way themselves.</body></html>
