As to the sources apparently cited by the chronicler in this passage, see the remarks in the Introduction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - The Hebrew word here translated <span class="cmt_word">acts</span> is identical with the words translated three times afterwards in this verse book. A uniform rendering for all might be found in the general word "history" or "acts." The question as to the probable nature of these works, and whether identical with our Books of Samuel, has been treated of in the Introduction. The Hebrew word for "seer," applied in this verse to Samuel, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. And that applied to Gad, though the Authorized Version has the same translation, "seer," is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. There can be no doubt that the word applied to Samuel would, under any circumstances, stand as the higher of the two names, were there any comparison intended between them. This is confirmed by the fact that it is found used only of him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9, 11, 18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-28.htm">1 Chronicles 26:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>) and of Hanani (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7, 10</a>), whereas the word applied to Gad in this verse is the <span class="accented">generic</span> name for seers, and is used several times in the Books of Chronicles of other persons than Gad. At the same time, the parenthesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>, to the effect that the word here used of Samuel as seer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) was superseded in later times (as, for instance, at the time of the writing of the Books of Samuel) by the word prophet (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>), compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>, points in a somewhat different direction. In the first place, it would indicate that our Authorized Version in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a> should rather stand, "Which say to the prophets, Prophesy not, and to the seers," etc. While for our present passage it would indicate that no insidious comparison is possible between Samuel and Gad as seers, but rather that Samuel retains the old honoured name by which he had been wont to be called, and that to <span class="accented">Nathan</span> is with equal naturalness attached the more modern name - the functions represented being essentially the same, or at least analogous. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>This great assembly joined with David in adoring God. Whoever is the mouth of the congregation, those only have the benefit who join him, not by bowing down the head, so much as by lifting up the soul. Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord. Solomon's kingdom typified the kingdom of the Messiah, whose throne is the throne of the Lord.</body></html>
