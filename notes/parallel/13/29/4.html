The "almug" tree is also said to have been brought in the same ships which brought the gold of Ophir. The Septuagint always translates by some form of the word <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> (except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>), which word comes very near the Coptic name for India. There is also a place in India, mentioned by Ptolemy, Ammianus, and Abulfeda, the site of the present <span class="accented">emporium</span> of Goa, called <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, and which would explain Both the Hebrew and the Septuagint words. An Indian site for Ophir would also well suit the mention of the ivory and the particular wood which the ships brought. On the other hand, the first occasion of this name Ophir finds it placed among the tribes of <span class="accented">Joktan's</span> descendants, who occupied South Arabia. It is there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-23.htm">1 Chronicles 1:23</a>) placed between Sheba and Havilah, beth abounding in gold. There are other considerations that favour Arabia. Many other places have been suggested, and some of them supported by respectable authorities, such as Eastern Africa, South America and Peru, Phrygia, etc. If there be a real question about it, to the prejudice of Arabia, it would be to India we must look. That some of the commodities brought belonged more especially to India, though even in that case the majority belonged undoubtedly to Arabia, is very true. This circumstance throws great probability into the suggestion that whether Ophir were in Arabia or India, it was a great <span class="accented">emporium</span>, and not simply an exporter of its own particular produce (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>; Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). The last sentence of this verse certainly says that the destined use of the <span class="cmt_word">refined silver</span>, as well as of the <span class="cmt_word">gold of Ophir, was to overlay the walls of the houses</span>. We know that gold was used for this purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-5.htm">2 Chronicles 3:5-10</a>). But we do not read of the silver being used for <span class="accented">overlaying</span> purposes. We also read that none of the drinking-vessels of Solomon were of <span class="accented">silver</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> "it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>). It is possible, the order of the-sentences notwithstanding, that the mention of the <span class="accented">refined silver</span> is only to pro-pare the way for the contents of ver. 5, and that it mast not be applied to the last sentence of our present verse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-9 What is done in works of piety and charity, should be done willingly, not by constraint; for God loves a cheerful giver. David set a good example. This David offered, not from constraint, or for show; but because he had set his affection to the house of God, and thought he could never do enough towards promoting that good work. Those who would draw others to good, must lead the way themselves.</body></html>
