It remained current in Western Asia long after the fall of the Persian Empire. The Hebrew word ('<span class= "ital">?darkonim</span>) occurs again only once, viz., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-27.htm" title="Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.">Ezra 8:27</a>, where it clearly means <span class= "ital">Darics,</span> and is so rendered by the Syriac (<span class= "ital">d?rik-ne</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The <span class= "ital">darkon</span> (or <span class= "ital">darbon</span>) is mentioned in the Talmud as a <span class= "ital">Persian</span> coin.

No real coins are mentioned in Scripture before the age of the exile.<p><span class= "bld">Silver ten thousand talents.</span>--About 4,000,000 in modern value (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-21.htm" title="And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.">1Kings 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm" title="And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.">1Kings 10:27</a>); or, according to Schrader, who argues from Assyrian data, 3,750,000. The value of the bronze and the iron must have been much greater then than now. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-14.htm" title="Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add thereto.">1Chronicles 22:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The Authorized Version translation drams occurs also twice in Ezra and twice in Nehemiah. There is no doubt that the coin referred to is the Persian <span class="accented">daric</span>, with which the Jews became familiar during the time of their exile. The Hebrew word appears in three different forms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> As <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>; here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-27.htm">Ezra 8:27</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> As <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70-72</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> As <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span>; in rabbinical writings, but not in Scripture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Respecting the possible derivations of the words in the first and second forms, see Gesenins's 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>, and Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible' (2nd edit., p. 181). The obverse of the coin shows the image of a king, with bow and spear. The value of the coin is variously computed at thirteen shillings and sixpence or twenty. two shillings and sixpence. Keil suggests that the mention of <span class="accented">darics</span> as well as talents in this verse may point to some of the gold being contributed in the shape of <span class="accented">coin</span> instead of talents-<span class="accented">weight</span>. This does not seem likely, however, because, of course, the <span class="accented">daric</span> itself was not in use in Jerusalem in David's time, and any gold coin that was then in use might have received mention on its own account, even if translated also into the <span class="accented">daric.</span> The Septuagint translates in this verse merely by the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, the Vulgate by <span class="accented">solidos.</span> Under any circumstances, the coin is to be distinguished from the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>. Specimens of the <span class="accented">daric</span>, both in gold and silver, exist in the Paris and Vienna Museums. The Hebrew word for the <span class="cmt_word">ten thousand</span> preceding the so-called <span class="accented">drams</span> of this verse is the word for "myriad" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>, a shortened form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>), found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:1-9 What is done in works of piety and charity, should be done willingly, not by constraint; for God loves a cheerful giver.
