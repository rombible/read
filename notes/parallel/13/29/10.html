David thanks God because his people are at one with him on the subject nearest his heart. Touching this fine utterance of a true inspiration, which the chronicler--or rather, perhaps, his authority--puts into the mouth of the aged king, we may remark that the spirit which found expression in the stirring odes of psalmists and the trumpet-tones of prophets in olden times, in the latter days, when psalmody was weak and prophecy dead, flowed forth in the new outlet of impassioned prayer.<p><span class= "bld">Before all.</span>--To <span class= "ital">the eyes of all</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-11.htm" title="No, my lord, hear me: the field give I you, and the cave that is therein, I give it you; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it you: bury your dead.">Genesis 23:11</a>), and frequently.<p><span class= "bld">Lord God of Israel our rather.</span>--The connection is "Israel our father," not "Jehovah our father."

Yet comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-16.htm" title="Doubtless you are our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: you, O LORD, are our father, our redeemer; your name is from everlasting.">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-8.htm" title="But now, O LORD, you are our father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm" title="Do you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm" title="A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? said the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name.

The fatherhood of God, though thus occasionally affirmed in prophetic writings, hardly became a ruling idea within the limits of Old Testament times. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-9.htm" title="And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.">Matthew 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm" title="After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.">Matthew 6:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For ever and ever.</span>--From <span class= "ital">eternity even unto eternity.</span> (Comp. the doxologies of the first and third books of the Psalter--<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-13.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting.

It includes adoration, acknowledgment of the inherent nature of human dependence, self-humiliation, and confession, dedication of all the offerings, and prayer both for the whole people in general, and for Solomon in particular, in view of his future position and responsibilities. Its utter repudiation of all idea of meritoriousness is very striking. The traces are visible of what may be called snatches of memory on the part of David from various religious odes of his own authorship, as well as from those of others still on record, as, for instance, especially in vers. 14-17, compared with passages in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89, </a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39.htm">Psalm 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144.htm">Psalm 144</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17.htm">Psalm 17</a>; and 139. But the unity of this service is abundantly conspicuous, and every sentence seems weighed and measured for the occasion. The scene, reaching its climax in what is recorded in ver. 20, must have been one of the utmost religious grandeur and impressiveness. It is true that the very last clause, which couples the reverence done on the part of the assembled multitude to the king, with that done to Jehovah himself, strikes us as an unfortunate conjunction. It does not, indeed, need upon its merits any vindication, considering the tenor of all which has preceded; but it may be felt an extenuation of the form in which the expression occurs, if we suppose (as we justly may) that the people viewed their act in the light of part of their religious service at that particular time. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-31.htm">1 Kings 1:31</a> the same words express the reverence paid to David, though in numerous other passages they mark that offered to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:10-19 We cannot form a right idea of the magnificence of the temple, and the buildings around it, about which such quantities of gold and silver were employed. But the unsearchable riches of Christ exceed the splendour of the temple, infinitely more than that surpassed the meanest cottage on earth. Instead of boasting of these large oblations, David gave solemn thanks to the Lord. All they gave for the Lord's temple was his own; if they attempted to keep it, death would soon have removed them from it. They only use they could make of it to their real advantage, was, to consecrate it to the service of Him who gave it.</body></html>
