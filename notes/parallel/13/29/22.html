Among other things, it vividly illustrates the almost sovereign dignity of the high priest's office; it also explains the deposition of Abiathar (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-32.htm" title="And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.

This latter expression is more forcible than the former. The <span class="cmt_word">second time</span> of making Solomon king is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-1.htm">1 Chronicles 23:1</a>. The statement that <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span> was anointed to be <span class="cmt_word">priest</span> must probably be understood to describe, either the re-anointing of him (just as "they made Solomon king the second time") on an occasion which particularly invited it; or an anointing which had not been before fully performed. This latter is, perhaps, an unlikely supposition; but at the same time, the fact of any previous ceremony of the kind does not happen to be narrated. Zadok had been joint priest with Abiatbar of the line of Ithamar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>, 29; 19:11); but now he was anointed under circumstances of special publicity, and at a crisis of special interest, to supersede Abiathar. who had sided with Adonijah, and who was early to be removed altogether from the sacred office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7, 8, 32, 38, 44, 45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26, 27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>29:20-25 This great assembly joined with David in adoring God. Whoever is the mouth of the congregation, those only have the benefit who join him, not by bowing down the head, so much as by lifting up the soul. Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord. Solomon's kingdom typified the kingdom of the Messiah, whose throne is the throne of the Lord.</body></html>
