They were carved out of the "portion of Judah," which had been found <span class="accented">dispropor</span>tioned during the interval that elapsed between the first settlements, viz. of Judah and the sons of Joseph, and the completion of the settlements westward of Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1-6</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3, 17</a>). From the second of these groups, Tochen (see suggestion in' Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) is omitted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a>, where only "four cities" are summed. The allusion (ver. 31) to the reign of David is sufficiently explained by the fact that during his persecuted wanderings he was often in the portion of Simeon, to three of the cities of which he sent presents from the spoils of the Amalekites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26-31</a>); and Ziklag became his own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>), special mention being made of how it passed into the tribe of Judah. The fuller name of Baal (ver. 33) is given as Baalath-beer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-8.htm">Joshua 19:8</a>, where it is followed by the addition "Ramath [<span class="accented">height</span>] of the south." It may be noted that this description of the allotment of Simeon begins with Beer-sheba and ends with Baalath-beer. The expression (ver. 33), and their genealogy" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> infinitive Hithp., used as a noun - will be more properly translated, <span class="accented">their table of genealogy</span>, or <span class="accented">their registration.</span> The following <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> may then refer to "their habitations" rather than themselves, so that the clause, as a whole, would mean, "These were their dwellings, and their registration was correct to them." Bertheau, however, takes the meaning to be, "And there was their family register to them," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "They had their own family register." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>4:1-43 Genealogies. - In this chapter we have a further account of Judah, the most numerous and most famous of all the tribes; also an account of Simeon. The most remarkable person in this chapter is Jabez. We are not told upon what account Jabez was more honourable than his brethren; but we find that he was a praying man. The way to be truly great, is to seek to do God's will, and to pray earnestly. Here is the prayer he made. Jabez prayed to the living and true God, who alone can hear and answer prayer; and, in prayer he regarded him as a God in covenant with his people. He does not express his promise, but leaves it to be understood; he was afraid to promise in his own strength, and resolved to devote himself entirely to God. Lord, if thou wilt bless me and keep me, do what thou wilt with me; I will be at thy command and disposal for ever. As the text reads it, this was the language of a most ardent and affectionate desire, Oh that thou wouldest bless me! Four things Jabez prayed for. 1. That God would bless him indeed. Spiritual blessings are the best blessings: God's blessings are real things, and produce real effects. 2. That He would enlarge his coast. That God would enlarge our hearts, and so enlarge our portion in himself, and in the heavenly Canaan, ought to be our desire and prayer. 3. That God's hand might be with him. God's hand with us, to lead us, protect us, strengthen us, and to work all our works in us and for us, is a hand all-sufficient for us. 4. That he would keep him from evil, the evil of sin, the evil of trouble, all the evil designs of his enemies, that they might not hurt, nor make him a Jabez indeed, a man of sorrow. God granted that which he requested. God is ever ready to hear prayer: his ear is not now heavy.</body></html>
