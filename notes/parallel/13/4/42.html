The band of five hundred would seem to have belonged to the clans which had already smitten the Hamites. Neither Ishi (<span class= "ital">Yish'i</span>) nor his sons are otherwise known. If a totally different expedition were intended, the expression, "and of them--of the sons of Simeon--five hundred men," would be a needlessly misleading periphrasis for, "And some of the sons of Simeon." "Of them" can only refer to the clans whose emigration in the days of Hezekiah has been the subject of this section.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 42, 43.</span> - These verses give the further exploits, with a view of settlement, of certain of the tribe of Simeon. And of them we should prefer to apply to those already mentioned (vers. 34-41), did the expression stand alone. But the following clause in apposition, of the sons of Simeon, seems intended to <span class="accented">prevent</span> the supposition that <span class="accented">they are</span> the Simeonites to whom alone allusion is made. Keil again ('Comm.,' in <span class="accented">loc</span>.) refers those intended to ver. 27, because he reads, for Ishi, the Shimei of ver. 27, on very insufficient grounds. It is a question whether the movement of ver. 42 is to be understood as arising out of that other the account of which closes in ver. 41, or whether it were not a co-ordinate movement. It still would probably enough spring from the same intrinsic causes. The allotment of the tribe of Simeon carved out of that of Judah was found too small for their growing numbers, though Simeon was not of the most numerous. Nor is it necessary to suppose - perhaps it is rather necessary to <span class="accented">correct</span> the impression - that this expedition, issuing in a permanent settlement, lay at all near the conquests of the "thirteen princes." It is, on the whole, most natural to consider that one event concludes with ver. 41, and that the following events (vers. 42, 43) are distinct and independent. All requisite light as to who these "smitten Amalekites" were, is for them too significantly furnished by comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>.

The most remarkable person in this chapter is Jabez. We are not told upon what account Jabez was more honourable than his brethren; but we find that he was a praying man. The way to be truly great, is to seek to do God's will, and to pray earnestly. Here is the prayer he made. Jabez prayed to the living and true God, who alone can hear and answer prayer; and, in prayer he regarded him as a God in covenant with his people. He does not express his promise, but leaves it to be understood; he was afraid to promise in his own strength, and resolved to devote himself entirely to God. Lord, if thou wilt bless me and keep me, do what thou wilt with me; I will be at thy command and disposal for ever. As the text reads it, this was the language of a most ardent and affectionate desire, Oh that thou wouldest bless me! Four things Jabez prayed for. 1. That God would bless him indeed. Spiritual blessings are the best blessings: God's blessings are real things, and produce real effects. 2. That He would enlarge his coast. That God would enlarge our hearts, and so enlarge our portion in himself, and in the heavenly Canaan, ought to be our desire and prayer. 3. That God's hand might be with him. God's hand with us, to lead us, protect us, strengthen us, and to work all our works in us and for us, is a hand all-sufficient for us. 4. That he would keep him from evil, the evil of sin, the evil of trouble, all the evil designs of his enemies, that they might not hurt, nor make him a Jabez indeed, a man of sorrow. God granted that which he requested. God is ever ready to hear prayer: his ear is not now heavy.</body></html>
