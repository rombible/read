The arrangement of the Levites, and the distribution of their functions in the presence of the princes, as here described, and as it is even more strongly put (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>), "by" them, simply points to the fact that the ultimate outer authority, as between Church and state, lay with the state.
