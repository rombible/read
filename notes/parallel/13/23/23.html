But <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/24-26.htm" title="The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.">1Chronicles 24:26-27</a> shows that the chronicler's registers named a third son of Merari, viz., Jaaziah, whose descendents constituted the three houses of Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri, in the time of David. Adding these, we get seven clans, one too many for our purpose.<p>Perhaps the Mahli of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-23.htm" title="The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.">1Chronicles 23:23</a> is a mistaken repetition from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-21.htm" title="The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.">1Chronicles 23:21</a>, due to some ancient scribe. The word "three" at the end of the verse would be added after the mistake had become fixed. It is wanting in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-30.htm" title="The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.">1Chronicles 24:30</a>, which otherwise repeats <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-23.htm" title="The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.">1Chronicles 23:23</a>. Excluding this second Mahli as spurious, we get six clans of Merarites; and thus, altogether, twenty-four classes of Levitical overseers of the work of the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:">1Chronicles 23:4</a>), consisting of nine Gershonite, nine Kohathite, and six Merarite houses. This number of classes or guilds tallies exactly with the total of 24,000 Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:">1Chronicles 23:4</a>), for it allows a thousand to the class (or clan). See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-1.htm" title="And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.">1Chronicles 13:1</a>.<p>It is right to remark (1) that the passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/24-26.htm" title="The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.">1Chronicles 24:26-27</a>, itself needs emendation (see Notes there); (2) that the old versions--viz., the LXX., Vulg., Syriac, and Arabic--have the reading of our present text in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/23-21.htm" title="The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.">1Chronicles 23:21-23</a>, so that the assumed omission of Jaaziah and his sons must be very ancient, and is probably due to an oversight of an early editor, if not of the chronicler himself; (3) in the two other passages of the Old Testament where the sons of Merari are named, only two--viz., Mahli and Mushi--appear; and (4) that the recurrence of the name Mahli in our <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-23.htm" title="The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.">1Chronicles 23:23</a> as a son of Mushi is easily paralleled: <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/23-9.htm" title="The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.">1Chronicles 23:9-10</a> (" Shimei" twice). But it is easier to suppose an omission here than an interpolation of unknown names at <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/24-26.htm" title="The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.">1Chronicles 24:26-27</a>. And the correspondence of the present list up to this point with that of 1 Chronicles 24 favours the assumption of an unintentional omission in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-21.htm" title="The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.">1Chronicles 23:21</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Mushi</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-30.htm">1 Chronicles 24:30</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-23 David, having given charge concerning the building of the temple, settles the method of the temple service, and orders the officers of it.
