(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-12.htm" title="And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as worked iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-10.htm" title="And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that worked in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:">2Chronicles 34:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-13.htm" title="Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that worked the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.">2Chronicles 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-9.htm" title="Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.">Ezra 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-16.htm" title="And the rulers knew not where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.">Nehemiah 2:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">From the age of</span> <span class= "bld">twenty years and upward.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-3.htm" title="Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.">1Chronicles 23:3</a> states that the Levites were numbered "from the age of thirty and upward." Some would banish discrepancy by the assumption that "thirty" is an ancient error of transcription; others imagine that the chronicler has simply incorporated two divergent statements, as he found them in his authorities. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-23.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall you number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-30.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old shall you number them, every one that enters into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-35.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that enters into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 4:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-43.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that enters into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-47.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:47</a>, the Levites were bound to serve "from thirty years old and upward" to fifty years of age; whereas <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/8-24.htm" title="This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 8:24-25</a>, fixes the age "from twenty and five years old and upward" to fifty; and this, according to Ewald, is the more exact account. It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm" title="Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;">2Chronicles 31:17</a>, that the later practice, at all events, was for the Levites to enter on their sacred functions at the age of twenty. Accordingly, the older commentators have supposed that David twice numbered the Levites: first, as the Law required, from the age of thirty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-3.htm" title="Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.">1Chronicles 23:3</a>); and again, towards the close of his reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-27.htm" title="For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:">1Chronicles 23:27</a>), from the age of twenty, because he perceived that the duties had become less onerous, and might therefore be borne by younger men. (Comp. however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-3.htm" title="From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: you and Aaron shall number them by their armies.">Numbers 1:3</a>, from which it appears that the military age, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the age of full virile strength, was reckoned "from twenty years old and upward.')<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - This and the remaining verses of the chapter contain some general provisions regarding the offices and future work of the Levites - in part David's last edition of such provisions. (On the present verse comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1-3, 21-23, 29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-23.htm">Numbers 8:23-26</a>.) It is not easy to reconcile this verse with ver. 3. Keil cuts the knot at once by supposing the "thirty" years of ver. 3 to be the error of a copyist, to whose memory the Mosaic census was present. And with Bertheau, he objects to the supposition that this verse describes a supplementary census, in conformity with "David's last words" (ver. 27), and as contrasted with his former directions. With the exception of what is contained in vers. 25-27, it is true that these do not offer themselves sufficient indications to make one feel confident of this explanation. On the other hand, to set down the number "thirty" in ver. 3 at once to the mistake of a copyist is too summary and convenient a way of escaping an awkward difficulty. It is evident that the following three verses do purport to explain why at this time the age of allowable service was altered to a standard so much lower than of old, and to assert that this alteration was recognized by the last orders of David. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:24-32 Now the people of Israel were so many, there should be more employed in the temple service, that every Israelite who brought an offering might find a Levite ready to help him. When more work is to be done, it is pity but there should be more workmen. A new heart, a spiritual mind, which delights greatly in God's commandments, and can find a refreshing feast in his ordinances, forms the great distinction between the true Christian and all other men in the world. To the spiritual man every service will yield satisfaction. He will be ever abounding in the work of the Lord; being never so happy as when employed for such a good Master, in so pleasant a service. He will not regard whether he is called to take the lead, or to keep the charge of others who are placed over him. May we seek and serve the Lord uprightly, and leave all the rest to his disposal, by faith in his word.</body></html>
