The Hebrew here is peculiar. We may render: "Of these let there be for superintending the work of the house of Jehovah twenty-four thousand, and scribes and judges six thousand."<p><span class= "bld">To set forward.</span>--An infinitive, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-12.htm" title="Only the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.">1Chronicles 22:12</a>. The verb is that of which the participle often occurs in the titles of the Psalms. (Authorised "Version, "chief musician.") It means "to lead," or "superintend." The Levites had a share in prisoners of war, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-30.htm" title="And of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them to the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.">Numbers 31:30</a>. These they could employ in the more menial work of the sanctuary. The Gibeonites were spared on condition of becoming "hewers of wood and drawers of water," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Levitical bondsmen; and other whole cities may have received the same terms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-23.htm" title="Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being slaves, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.">Joshua 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-27.htm" title="And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose.">Joshua 9:27</a>).

The word means <span class= "ital">writers</span> (comp. Assyrian <span class= "ital">sadh?ru,</span> to write). The progress of the entire people in power and civilisation elevated the Levites also; and from a warlike troop of defenders of the sanctuary, they became peaceful guardians of the great Temple at Jerusalem and its treasures, musicians and artists in its service, instructors and judges scattered throughout the whole country (Ewald).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To set forward</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>, Piel conjugation). The strict meaning of the word here is <span class="accented">to superintend.</span> The word has already occurred in the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-21.htm">1 Chronicles 15:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Officers and judges</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The explanation of the nature of the work of these, as really outward work, for the "outward business of Israel," is distinctly stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5-11</a>. These <span class="accented">officers</span> are mentioned under the same Hebrew term in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>, in a very different connection. It is plain that they were generally foremen, or overseers; while the <span class="accented">judges</span> took cognizance of matters which involved the interests of religion. This verse and the following give between them the <span class="accented">four</span> divisions of Levites, afterwards to be more fully described. The fuller account of the "twenty-four thousand" priests (including attendants) occupies ch. 24; the "six thousand" officers and judges, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20-32</a>; the "four thousand" porters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-19</a>; and the "four thousand who praised the Lord with the instruments," ch. 25. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-23 David, having given charge concerning the building of the temple, settles the method of the temple service, and orders the officers of it.
