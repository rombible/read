The law respecting the sacred tent was naturally applied to the future Temple. It is hardly fair to say, with Reuss, that "in the perspective of the author the Tabernacle of David and the Temple of Solomon were confounded with each other." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/16-37.htm" title="So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:">1Chronicles 16:37-39</a>, the chronicler has clearly distinguished two sacred tents: that of the Ark on Mount Zion, and the ancient sanctuary at Gibeon. Throughout that lengthy narrative of the transfer of the Ark, the Temple is not mentioned at all. And if in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-28.htm" title="Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;">1Chronicles 23:28</a> David speaks of "courts" and "chambers," that only shows that the king meant his assignation of the duties of the Levites to be permanent. Nor will it make much difference if we allow that the writer, in speaking of David's tent, has used language more applicable to the Temple of Solomon. The functions of the Levites in both would be essentially the same. The great historian Ewald believed the whole section, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-24.htm" title="These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.">1Chronicles 23:24</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm" title="These likewise cast lots over against their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brothers.">1Chronicles 24:31</a> to be an authentic extract from "the Book of Origins," which he refers to the early years of Solomon's reign.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Keep the charge of the tabernacle... holy place... sons of Aaron</span>. This concluding verse is equivalent to a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1-7</a>; in the first verse of which passage Aaron and the priests generally are reminded both of their representative character and position, and of the solemn responsibility which rested on them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:24-32 Now the people of Israel were so many, there should be more employed in the temple service, that every Israelite who brought an offering might find a Levite ready to help him. When more work is to be done, it is pity but there should be more workmen. A new heart, a spiritual mind, which delights greatly in God's commandments, and can find a refreshing feast in his ordinances, forms the great distinction between the true Christian and all other men in the world. To the spiritual man every service will yield satisfaction. He will be ever abounding in the work of the Lord; being never so happy as when employed for such a good Master, in so pleasant a service. He will not regard whether he is called to take the lead, or to keep the charge of others who are placed over him. May we seek and serve the Lord uprightly, and leave all the rest to his disposal, by faith in his word.</body></html>
