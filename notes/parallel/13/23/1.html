Perhaps our pointing is wrong.

(Comp. 1 Chronicles 20, introductory remarks.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David... made Solomon his son king over Israel</span>. These words give the key note of what remains in this book. David made his son king, as he himself acknowledges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>), under the superintending direction of God. The manner in which the formal event was precipitated by the conduct of Adonijah is found at length in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-53</a>. The original occasion alluded to there more than once, on which David promised, "and sware" to Bathsheba, that her son should be his chief heir and successor to the throne, is not distinctly recorded. We can easily assign one convenient place in the history for it to have found monition, viz. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>. The brevity of the statement which composes this verse, when compared with all the deeply interesting matter recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-53</a>, is one among many other very clear illustrations of the purposed silence of our present history in certain directions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-23 David, having given charge concerning the building of the temple, settles the method of the temple service, and orders the officers of it. When those of the same family were employed together, it would engage them to love and assist one another.</body></html>
