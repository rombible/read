Possibly the quotation of a short sentence often on David's lips. Men given to music may have been very conscious of it, in ancient days, as well as in modern. The language, however, does not necessarily assert that David claimed the inventing or in any similar sense the <span class="accented">making</span> of these musical instruments, but that he <span class="accented">appointed</span> them for the service of praise. What some of them were may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a> - "cymbals, psalteries, harps, trumpets" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35, 36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-23 David, having given charge concerning the building of the temple, settles the method of the temple service, and orders the officers of it.
