The meaning is that the priests represented a higher grade of holiness, a more thorough consecration, than the mere Levites, because they were called to the discharge of a higher and holier ministry.<p><span class= "bld">He and his sons.</span>--All the priests are included with Aaron.<p><span class= "bld">To burn incense.</span>--The Hebrew term means to burn victims as well as incense.<p><span class= "bld">To minister unto him, and to bless in his name</span>--The same words occur (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>) with reference to the purpose for which the tribe of Levi was "separated." The tribe obviously includes the Aaronite clan. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm" title="And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And to bless in his name.</span>--This appears right from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-23.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,">Numbers 6:23</a>.

From Amram, the first-mentioned son of Kohath, come the two great names of <span class="cmt_word">Aaron and Moses</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Aaron was separated,... and his sons for ever</span>. This statement must be read, both with ver. 3 - into the number of Levites mentioned in which Aaron and his sons do not count - and with ver. 14, which implies that Moses and his sons did count into that number. The sons of Aaron are dealt with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-1.htm">1 Chronicles 24:1-19</a>, <span class="accented">infra. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That he should sanctify the most holy things</span>. The Hebrew text renders it doubtful whether the rendering here should not rather be, "Aaron was separated to sanctify <span class="accented">him</span> as most holy," etc. If it be so, this is the only place where the forcible term, "holy of holies" (most holy), is used of Aaron. The duties of the priest are described as threefold, in this place, viz.: "to burn incense before the Lord," - this will carry the idea of making atonement; "to minister to God," on behalf of man, ? this will be one part of the work of a mediator; and "to bless in the Name of God," - this will fulfil the remaining part. For <span class="accented">ever.</span> The proviso may, no doubt, include reference to the "ever-living High Priest." The threefold summary of solemn and beneficent duties receives ample illustration from many passages, and in special connection with the names of Aaron and his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1, 38, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1, 35, 45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:1-23 David, having given charge concerning the building of the temple, settles the method of the temple service, and orders the officers of it.
