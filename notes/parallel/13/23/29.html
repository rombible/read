Seven other specifications of service are continued in this verse, with which we may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26-32</a>. For the <span class="accented">shewbread.</span> The first mention of shewbread is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>. The directions for making it are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>. The twelve unleavened cakes of which it consisted, heaped on the table in two piles, represented the twelve tribes, and intimated the Divine acceptance of the offerings of each faithful tribe (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the fine flour for meat offering</span>.

These two words occur also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35, 36</a>, where they are rendered respectively "in measure" and "in meteyard." Perhaps the exacter rendering here would be "for all matters of liquid and solid measure." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>23:24-32 Now the people of Israel were so many, there should be more employed in the temple service, that every Israelite who brought an offering might find a Levite ready to help him. When more work is to be done, it is pity but there should be more workmen. A new heart, a spiritual mind, which delights greatly in God's commandments, and can find a refreshing feast in his ordinances, forms the great distinction between the true Christian and all other men in the world. To the spiritual man every service will yield satisfaction. He will be ever abounding in the work of the Lord; being never so happy as when employed for such a good Master, in so pleasant a service. He will not regard whether he is called to take the lead, or to keep the charge of others who are placed over him. May we seek and serve the Lord uprightly, and leave all the rest to his disposal, by faith in his word.</body></html>
