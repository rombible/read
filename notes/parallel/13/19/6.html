Another Rehoboth ("Rehoboth-ir," <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-11.htm" title="Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,">Genesis 10:11</a>) lay on the Tigris, north-east of Nineveh, and was a suburb of that great city.

The Hebrew root of very strong force, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, is here employed, and which our Authorized Version translates, both in the parallel place and elsewhere, far more uncompromisingly than here. <span class="cmt_word">A thousand talents</span>. Not stated in Samuel. This talent was of three thousand shekels, believed to be equivalent to f 342. Mesopotamia. The parallel place has Aram-beth-rehob, instead of our <span class="accented">Aram-naharaim</span> ("Syria of the Two Rivers," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Tigris and Euphrates; Authorized Version, "<span class="cmt_word">Mesopotamia"</span>). From comparing this verso with ver. 16, it may seem probable that those strictly called "<span class="accented">of Mesopotamia"</span> lent either no aid at first or but very partial. It is observable that the numbers of men supplied by Beth-rehob, Zobah, and Ishtob in the parallel place (viz. <span class="accented">thirty-two thousand</span>) agree with the numbers of this verse, from which we may conclude that, whatever Aram-beth-rehob (probably either Reho-both on the Euphrates, or Rehob last of Lebanon) and Aram-naharaim may <span class="accented">strictly</span> stand for respectively, they here substantially mean the same. It is possible that the difference is that of a corrupt text or careless copying. The Aram-naharaim (<span class="accented">Mesopotamia</span>), which comes before us first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>, passes out of Scripture language after the defeats of this chapter - the tract of country which it designated (some seven hundred miles by twenty to two hundred and fifty) being absorbed, first by Assyria, and afterwards by Babylon. The <span class="accented">Assyrian Inscriptions</span> reveal the fact that Mesopotamia was the prey of a largo number of small separate tribes at the period of the judges and the early Jewish monarchy, which is quite consistent with the glimpses we here get of it and its people<span class="cmt_word">. Aram-maachah</span> probably designates the tract of country north of East Manasseh, bordering on Palestine, and bounded by the Jordan, Mount Hermon, and on its east, Salcah. <span class="cmt_word">Zobah</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>). The parallel place adds also "the men of Ishtob." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/19.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>19:1-19 David's wars. - The history is here repeated which we read 2Sa 10.
