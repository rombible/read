The chronicler puts the total at 32,000 + the Maachathite contingent; Samuel at 32,000 + 1,000 Maachathites. The expression "32,000 chariotry" (<span class= "ital">rekeb</span>) is not to be pressed. The writer wished to lay proper stress on the chariots and cavalry as the chief arm of the Aramaean states, and at the same time to be as concise as possible. That he was not thinking of 32,000 chariots in the literal sense is clear, (1) because he must have known that an army would not consist of chariots only; (2) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-4.htm" title="And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.">1Chronicles 18:4</a> he had already assigned to the army of Zobah its natural proportions of chariots, cavalry, and infantry. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-18.htm" title="But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.">1Chronicles 19:18</a>, below.) The present text of Samuel can hardly be right, as it makes the whole army consist of infantry. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm" title="And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.">2Samuel 8:4</a>.) The great plains of Aram were a natural training-ground for horsemen and charioteers.<p><span class= "bld">Who came and pitched</span> (their camp) <span class= "bld">before Medeba.</span>--Another detail peculiar to the Chronicles.

The reading in the parallel place is evidently what is intended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a> with its parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>).

The only safety of sinners consists in submitting to the Lord, seeking peace with him, and becoming his servants.
