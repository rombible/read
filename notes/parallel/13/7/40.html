"All these were sons of Asher, picked chiefs of the father-houses, valiant warriors, chiefs of the princes." This declares that the names in the foregoing series are those of the chiefs of the different Asherite clans. They are called "choice," picked men, <span class= "ital">eximii,</span> and chiefs of the princes or emirs. The clans appear to be identified with their chieftains.<p><span class= "bld">And the number throughout the genealogy.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and their census, in the host, in the battle</span>--<span class= "ital">their number in men was</span> 26,000." Perhaps we should render <span class= "ital">in the case of service in war.</span> The census here given has reference only to the number of males qualified for military service. In the Mosaic census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-41.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Asher, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 1:41</a>) the total of males of the tribe of Asher was 41,500; and a generation later, the fighting men were 53,000 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-47.htm" title="These are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered of them; who were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.">Numbers 26:47</a>). The date of the present census is not assigned. If it be that of David, which appears likely, the tribe may have declined in numbers and importance by his day. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-17.htm" title="Gilead stayed beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and stayed in his breaches.">Judges 5:17</a>. "Asher continued at the sea-shore, and abode on his creeks;" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> did not bestir himself for the war).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty and six thousand</span>. The number of Asherites, "of twenty years old and upwards, able to go forth to war," given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-40.htm">Numbers 1:40, 41</a>, was forty-one thousand five hundred. Forty years later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-44.htm">Numbers 26:44-47</a>; comp. ver. 2) the number was fifty-three thousand four hundred. But it is supposed that the twenty-six thousand of this verse may refer only to a portion of the tribe, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the large and distinguished family of Heber. It is to be noticed that the name of the tribe of Asher is not found in the list of the "chief rulers" lower down in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16-22</a>). The tone also in which reference is made to <span class="cmt_word">Asher</span> and Manasseh and Zebulun coming to Jerusalem to Hezekiah's Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11</a>) is very noticeable. This tribe, with Simeon, gave no judge to the nation, and of all the tribes west of the Jordan they stand by themselves in this respect. There is an ancient legend that the parents of St. Paul lived within the territories of Asher, at the place called Ahlab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>, otherwise Giscala, or Gush Chaleb.
