The tribe of Manasseh has been partly treated of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23-26</a>, viz. those of the tribe who inhabited Gilead and Bashan. Here those who inhabited this side Jordan are treated cf. And it is very difficult to give any coherent account of the differences of this passage when compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-28.htm">Numbers 26:28-34</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1-4</a>. In these places six families, or heads of families, are noted to only two, or at most three here, viz. Askriel, Shemida, and perhaps Abiezer (<span class="accented">iq.</span> Jeezer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-30.htm">Numbers 26:30</a>; comp. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a>). The opening clause of this verse also is unmanageable as it stands. One way of reducing it to coherence would be to Supply the words "his wife" between whom and bars, the similarity of the Hebrew letters of which to those of the Hebrew for "whom" might possibly account for the loss of it. The parenthesis about the concubine would then read with emphasis. But there is not the slightest reason to suppose there was such a wife. Another way would be to read the concubine as the mother of Ashriel, and prefix a conjunction, and, to the second "bare;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and she bare, or, she bare also Machir." But it seems pretty plain from Numbers and Joshua that Ashriel was not strictly a son, but only descendant of Manasseh; and, further, the irresistible impression is that Machir was the only son, strictly speaking (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>). The position of Ashriel in our present passage, first, is also very unsatisfactory in face of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a> and the other references already given. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-40 Genealogies. - Here is no account either of Zebulun or Dan. We can assign no reason why they only should be omitted; but it is the disgrace of the tribe of Dan, that idolatry began in that colony which fixed in Laish, and called it Dan, Jud 18 and there one of the golden calves was set up by Jeroboam. Dan is omitted, Re 7. Men become abominable when they forsake the worship of the true God, for any creature object.</body></html>
