At <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-1.htm" title="The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.">1Chronicles 6:1-3</a> only two names are given between Levi, uncle of Ephraim, and Moses, Joshua's elder contemporary. But abundant reason has already been shown for not interpreting these genealogies in a slavishly literal spirit, and without regard to their own contrary indications. It is obvious to common sense that when it is said that Moses was "son of Amram, son of Kohath, son of Levi," the meaning cannot be that only two generations intervened between the tribal patriarch and the age of Moses. Moreover, it is, to say the least, doubtful that the names in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-25.htm" title="And Rephah was his son, also Resheph, and Telah his son, and Tahan his son.">1Chronicles 7:25</a> represent a lineal descent of individuals, and not a group of variously connected clans.
