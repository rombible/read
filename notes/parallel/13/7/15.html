(the name is omitted). It is tempting to make Zeiophehad the other wife, who had only daughters, whereas Maachah bore a son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-16.htm" title="And Maachah the wife of Machir bore a son, and she called his name Peresh; and the name of his brother was Sheresh; and his sons were Ulam and Rakem.">1Chronicles 7:16</a>); but Numbers, <span class= "ital">l.c.,</span> and Josh., <span class= "ital">l.c.,</span> make Zelophehad a man. We must, therefore, suppose a <span class= "ital">lacuna</span> of some few words, which gave the name of Machir's second wife, and the descent of Zelophehad from her. The expression "of Huppim and of Shuppim" is literally "to Huppim and to Shuppim," that is, belonging to. So "of Tola," (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-2.htm" title="And the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and Jahmai, and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their father's house, to wit, of Tola: they were valiant men of might in their generations; whose number was in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six hundred.">1Chronicles 7:2</a>).<p>We have no means of further elucidating the import of this curious tribal record. That it relates to West Manasseh is inferred from its position here, as well from the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/5-23.htm" title="And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelled in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baalhermon and Senir, and to mount Hermon.">1Chronicles 5:23-24</a> treated of East Manasseh.

The name of Gilead, however, points to the transjordanic half of the tribe. The whole passage seems to assert an Aramean and a Benjamite element in the population of Western Manasseh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Maachah</span>.

The distinct mention of the marriage of a Manassite to a Benjamite woman is to be noticed. <span class="cmt_word">Zelophehad</span>. The meaning of the preceding words, <span class="cmt_word">and the name of the second</span>, is unintelligible. Zelophehad was son of Hephen, who was (through Gilead and Maehir) great-grandson of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>).
