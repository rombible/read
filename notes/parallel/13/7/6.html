Ashbel is the second son of Benjamin in Numbers 26 and 1 Chronicles 8, and the third (perhaps second) in Genesis 46<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The sons of <span class="cmt_word">Benjamin; Bela</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Becher</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Jediael</span>, three. We have four passages for our authorities as to the sons of Benjamin, and it is not altogether easy to bring them into verbal harmony. They are <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-41</a>; the present passage; and ch. 8. Our present passage mentions three sons, as though they were all, and immediately proceeds to their posterity. The list in Genesis mentions ten, of whom, however, we know (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-40.htm">Numbers 26:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-3.htm">1 Chronicles 8:3, 4</a>) that three, Naaman, Ard, and Gem, were grandsons, being sons of Bela, under which circumstances the order in which the two former stand in Genesis is remarkable. Again, while Becher is given as the second son in both Genesis and our present place, he is not mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-41</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>. Ashbel, who in Genesis is given as the third, is expressly called the second son. Among the Ephraimites, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>), a Becher, with his descendants the Bachrites, is mentioned, and it is not improbable that, by marriage, the family were at <span class="accented">that time</span>, for manifest reasons of inheritance and possession, reckoned in this tribe, though by blood of the tribe of Benjamin. This subject is skilfully discussed by Lord A. C. Hervey (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:175). Lastly, Jediael of this passage and ver. 10 is not found in Genesis, in Numbers, or in our ch. 8. This name seems to have superseded in our passage the name Ashbel in Genesis, though it is impossible to speak certainly. It cannot be supposed to designate the same person, but rather a descendant in the same branch, whose family had come to importance "in the days of David." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>7:1-40 Genealogies. - Here is no account either of Zebulun or Dan. We can assign no reason why they only should be omitted; but it is the disgrace of the tribe of Dan, that idolatry began in that colony which fixed in Laish, and called it Dan, Jud 18 and there one of the golden calves was set up by Jeroboam. Dan is omitted, Re 7. Men become abominable when they forsake the worship of the true God, for any creature object.</body></html>
