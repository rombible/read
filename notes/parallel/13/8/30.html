Both of the missing names, however (viz. <span class="accented">Ner</span> after <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span>, and <span class="accented">Mikloth</span> after <span class="cmt_word">Zacher</span>), are introduced in verses immediately succeeding, where their sons are spoken cf. One name, <span class="accented">Zacher</span>, also is spelt as Zechariah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-37.htm">1 Chronicles 9:37</a>. Both these passages agree in representing Net as the grandfather of Saul. Not so the two passages in Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>), the first of which writes <span class="accented">Abiel</span> in the place of the grandfather instead of great-grandfather, which, however, need occasion little difficulty; and the second of which would certainly <span class="accented">allow</span> Ner to be grandfather to Saul, but seems to call him uncle. Even then, if we accept what the passage allows, it is somewhat remarkable that in the next verse Ner should be signalized as father of Abner rather than of Kish - a difficulty, however, much less considerable if we accept the suggestion (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) to translate ver. 51 thus, by the substitution of the word "sons" for "son:" "And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, were <span class="accented">sons</span> of Abiel." It must be remembered at the same time that this is not equivalent to saying that they were necessarily brothers, but only descendants of the <span class="accented">chief</span> of the family, of the Demarch or Phylarch under mention in the genealogy. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-40 Genealogies. - Here is a larger list of Benjamin's tribe. We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance. The memory of the just is blessed.</body></html>
