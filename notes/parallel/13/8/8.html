He has been identified with Ahi-Shahar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-10.htm" title="The sons also of Jediael; Bilhan: and the sons of Bilhan; Jeush, and Benjamin, and Ehud, and Chenaanah, and Zethan, and Tharshish, and Ahishahar.">1Chronicles 7:10</a>, because his name has a similar meaning, and even with the mysterious Aher (hypothetically Shaher) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-12.htm" title="Shuppim also, and Huppim, the children of Ir, and Hushim, the sons of Aher.">1Chronicles 7:12</a>. It is simpler to suppose that <span class= "ital">weeth-Shaharaim,</span> "and Shaharaim," has dropped out at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-7.htm" title="And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them, and begat Uzza, and Ahihud.">1Chronicles 8:7</a> (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-31.htm" title="And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zacher.">1Chronicles 8:31</a>). Expelled from Geba, Shaharaim found a refuge in Moab. (Comp. Ruth 1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/22-3.htm" title="And David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.">1Samuel 22:3-4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">After he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives.</span>--The Heb. is certainly corrupt. The easiest correction is to read <span class= "ital">'eth-Hushim</span> instead of '<span class= "ital">otham Hushim:</span> "and Shaharaim begat in the country of Moab, after divorcing Hushim and Baara his wives, he begat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-9.htm" title="And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcham,">1Chronicles 8:9</a>) of Hodesh his wife, Jobab," &c. This is supported by the LXX. The emigration of the clan Shaharaim, from its old home in Geba of Benjamin is called a divorce, in the figurative style of these genealogies; just as the amalgamation of clans is marriage. <span class= "ital">Hushim,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-12.htm" title="Shuppim also, and Huppim, the children of Ir, and Hushim, the sons of Aher.">1Chronicles 7:12</a>, is a Benjamite clan. In Moab, Shaharaim branched off into seven clans, whose names are given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/8-9.htm" title="And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcham,">1Chronicles 8:9-10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shaharaim</span>. It has been proposed, in the utter obscurity here, to add this name as a third to Uzza and Ahihud. This may be a way out, but if so, instead of repeating "and Shaharaim," it might be more natural to keep the former enigmatic nominative and object to <span class="cmt_word">begat</span>, whether Ehud or Gera. There can be little doubt that a copyist's error has given <span class="cmt_word">us them</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>) in place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, in the latter part of this verse, before the names of the wives. The sentence then would translate, "after his sending away [whether by divorce or not] Hushim and Baara his wives." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>8:1-40 Genealogies. - Here is a larger list of Benjamin's tribe. We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance. The memory of the just is blessed.</body></html>
