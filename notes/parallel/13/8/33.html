This seems to be a case of double naming. Others identify Ishui with Ishbosheth.<p><span class= "bld">Abinadab.</span>--Comp. Nadab, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-30.htm" title="And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab,">1Chronicles 8:30</a>. Both are probably Divine titles, meaning "the father (i.e., Jehovah) is noble."

Esh-baal ("man of Baal") is the true name. Ish-bosheth ("man of shame") is a sort of euphemism, avoiding the very mention of an idol. So the Merib-baal ("Baal strives;" rather, perhaps, Meri-Baal, "man of Baal") of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-34.htm" title="And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal; and Meribbaal begat Micah.">1Chronicles 8:34</a> appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame.

And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold your servant!">2Samuel 9:6</a>, &c, as Mephibosheth, where probably the right reading is Meribbosheth.

Beth-el, the sanctuary of the golden calf, or rather bullock, is called Beth-aven.

We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance. The memory of the just is blessed.</body></html>
