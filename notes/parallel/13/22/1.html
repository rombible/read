Obviously, we have here the goal of the entire narrative of the census, and the pestilence, which the chronicler would probably have omitted, as he has omitted that of the famine (2 Samuel 21), were it not for the fact that it shows how the site of the Temple was determined.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - This verse evidently belongs to the close of the last' chapter, and should have had its place there. It indicates a deep sense of relief that now visited David's mind. We can imagine how he had pondered often and long the "place where" of the "exceeding magnificent" house which it was in his heart to build for the Lord. The <span class="accented">place</span> was now found, and the more unexpected and "dreadful" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>) the method by which it was arrived at, the more convincing and satisfactory, at all events in some points of view. The extraordinary and impressive designating of this spot was in itself a signal for an active commencement of the work, and made at the same time such commencement practicable. Solomon and many others would afterwards often think, often speak, of the "threshing-finer of Ornan the Jebusite" as the place "which was shown to David his father," and which "David had prepared" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). Here, then, he builds "the altar of burnt offering," as, on the neighbouring "hill of Zion," he had reared the "tabernacle for the ark." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 On occasion of the terrible judgment inflicted on Israel for the sin of David, God pointed out the place where he would have the temple built; upon which, David was excited to make preparations for the great work. David must not build, but he would do all he could; he prepared abundantly before his death. What our hands find to do for God, and our souls, and those round us, let us do it with all our might, before our death; for after death there is no device nor working. And when the Lord refuses to employ us in those services which we desired, we must not be discouraged or idle, but do what we can, though in a humbler sphere.</body></html>
