In similar terms the famous Assyrian Sennacherib (Sin-ahi-irba) speaks of his palace as built "for the lodging (<span class= "ital">taprati</span>) of multitudes of men."

It is not said when nor to whom he spoke. The historian is merely representing the king's motive for these preparations.

It is impossible to fix the exact age of Solomon as marked by these words. In a "fragment" of Eupolemus (see Cory's 'Ancient Fragments of the Phoenician,' etc., Writers,' edit. London, 1832) he is put down at twelve years of age. Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 8:7, &sect; 8) as vaguely supposes he was fourteen at the time that he took the throne. He was the second son of Bathsheba, and can scarcely have exceeded the last-mentioned age by more than three or four years (yet comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1, 7</a>). This same language, "young and tender," is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>.

He is called <span class="accented">old</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>) when his strange wives "turned away his heart after other gods." We are not told his age at the time of his death. There are, in fact, no sufficient data for fixing to the year, or indeed within the liberal margin of several years, the age now designated as <span class="accented">young and tender.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 On occasion of the terrible judgment inflicted on Israel for the sin of David, God pointed out the place where he would have the temple built; upon which, David was excited to make preparations for the great work. David must not build, but he would do all he could; he prepared abundantly before his death. What our hands find to do for God, and our souls, and those round us, let us do it with all our might, before our death; for after death there is no device nor working. And when the Lord refuses to employ us in those services which we desired, we must not be discouraged or idle, but do what we can, though in a humbler sphere.</body></html>
