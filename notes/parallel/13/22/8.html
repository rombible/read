There, however, David is promised success in war, without any hint that warfare, as such, would unfit him for the sacred task which he longed to undertake. And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-3.htm" title="You know how that David my father could not build an house to the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.">1Kings 5:3</a>, Solomon implies that David's wars left him no leisure for the work.<p><span class= "bld">Thou hast shed blood.</span>--The emphatic word is "blood." Literally, <span class= "ital">Blood in abundance hast thou shed, and great wars hast thou made.</span><p><span class= "bld">Because thou hast shed much blood.</span>--Better. <span class= "ital">for torrents of blood</span> (plural) <span class= "ital">hast thou shed earthward before me.</span> The author of this narrative may well have remembered <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5-6</a>, and the denunciations of the prophets against men of blood. (Comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:">Amos 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:">Amos 2:1</a>, with David's treatment of the conquered Ammonites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-3.htm" title="And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.">1Chronicles 20:3</a>. And see also Hosea's denunciation of vengeance upon the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel: <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.">Hosea 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-7.htm" title="They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calls to me.">Hosea 7:7</a>). Or the verse may express the interpretation which David's own conscience put upon the oracle forbidding him to build the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast shed much blood</span>. This is repeated very distinctly below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>), and appears there again as acknowledged by the lip of David himself. It seems remarkable that no previous statement of this objection, nor even allusion to it, is found. Further, there seems no very opportune place for it in either our <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1-15</a> or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-17</a>. Yet, if it seem impossible to resist the impression that it must have found expression on the occasion referred to in those two passages, we may fit it in best between vers. 10 and 11 of the former reference, and between vers. 11 and 12 of the latter. So far, however, as our Hebrew text goes, this is the first place in which the statement is made. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:6-16 David gives Solomon the reason why he should build the temple. Because God named him. Nothing is more powerful to engage us in any service for God, than to know that we are appointed thereto. Because he would have leisure and opportunity to do it. He should have peace and quietness. Where God gives rest, he expects work. Because God had promised to establish his kingdom. God's gracious promises should quicken and strengthen our religious service. David delivered to Solomon an account of the vast preparations he had made for this building; not from pride and vain-glory, but to encourage Solomon to engage cheerfully in the great work. He must not think, by building the temple, to purchase a dispensation to sin; on the contrary, his doing that would not be accepted, if he did not take heed to fulfil the statutes of the Lord. In our spiritual work, as well as in our spiritual warfare, we have need of courage and resolution.</body></html>
