<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm" title="Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as you do; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up here.">Ezra 4:2</a>. The older construction, with a simple accusative, occurred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-12.htm" title="Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;">1Chronicles 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-30.htm" title="But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.">1Chronicles 21:30</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Arise therefore, and build.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And arise ye, and build.</span> The second clause explains how the first was to be carried out. Building the Lord a fair and noble sanctuary was equivalent to seeking His favour. Professions cost nothing, and they were not to serve the Lord "without cost" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-24.htm" title="And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will truly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is your for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.">1Chronicles 21:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To bring the ark.</span>--From its temporary abode on Mount Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-1.htm" title="And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.">1Chronicles 15:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The holy vessels of God</span>--e.g., the altar of burnt offering.<p><span class= "bld">That is to be built.</span>--The same participal form as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.">1Chronicles 22:9</a> : "shall be born."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God</span>. To settle these in a fixed home had now been of a long time the consuming desire of David's heart (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-1.htm">1 Chronicles 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2-4</a>). Into the house that is to be built. The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, before "the house," is to be noticed here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-26.htm">1 Chronicles 25:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-35.htm">Nehemiah 10:35</a>). Also the Niphal participle, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;</span>, here translated "that is <span class="accented">to be</span> built," is to be noticed. The meaning of David would be better met probably thus: "Arise, build the sanctuary... to bring the ark... into the house (then) builded to the Name of the Lord." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:17-19 Whatever is done towards rendering the word of God generally known and attended to, is like bringing a stone, or an ingot of gold, towards erecting the temple. This should encourage us when we grieve that we do not see more fruit of our labours; much good may appear after our death, which we never thought of. Let us not then be weary of well doing. The work is in the hands of the Prince of peace. As he, the Author and Finisher of the work, is pleased to employ us as his instruments, let us arise and be doing, encouraging and helping one another; working by his rule, after his example, in dependence on his grace, assured that he will be with us, and that our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</body></html>
