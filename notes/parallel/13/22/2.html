Solomon found them by census to be 153,600 souls. The census was a preliminary to apportioning their several tasks. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.">2Chronicles 2:17-18</a>.) David, probably on the present occasion, had held a similar census of the Canaanite serfs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.">2Chronicles 2:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And he set.</span>--<span class= "ital">Appointed</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/15-16.htm" title="And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers to be the singers with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.">1Chronicles 15:16-17</a>); literally, <span class= "ital">caused to stand.</span><p><span class= "bld">Masons.</span>--<span class= "ital">Hewers</span>; selected, apparently, from among "the strangers."<p><span class= "bld">Wrought stones.</span>--"Saxum quadratum," square stones (1 Kings 5:31; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-9.htm" title="And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,">Isaiah 9:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To build the house</span>--i.e., for building it hereafter. It is not said that the work was begun at once, but only that the organisation of the serf labour originated with David.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The strangers</span>. These are plainly called in the Septuagint "proselytes" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>). They were, of course, foreign workmen, who came in pursuit of their trade. The injunctions as to "strangers," and with regard to showing them kindness, are very numerous, beginning with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19, 48, 49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>(20); Exodus 23:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10, 33, 34</a>; Numbers 15:14-16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33-35</a>. It was not David's object merely to gain cheap or compulsory work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17, 18</a>), but to obtain a skill, which immigrants from certain places would possess, in excess of that of his own people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-7.htm">2 Chronicles 2:7, 8, 13, 14</a>), especially considering the absorption of Israel in the pursuit of war, which had so largely impeded their study and practice of these the arts of peace. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 On occasion of the terrible judgment inflicted on Israel for the sin of David, God pointed out the place where he would have the temple built; upon which, David was excited to make preparations for the great work. David must not build, but he would do all he could; he prepared abundantly before his death. What our hands find to do for God, and our souls, and those round us, let us do it with all our might, before our death; for after death there is no device nor working. And when the Lord refuses to employ us in those services which we desired, we must not be discouraged or idle, but do what we can, though in a humbler sphere.</body></html>
