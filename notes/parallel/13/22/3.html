Although the expression, "the land whose stones are iron" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>), is possibly enough a poetical figure where it stands, yet some of the force of the figure may have sprung from its nearness to <span class="accented">fact.</span> The abundant use of iron in a great variety of tools, implements, weapons, and the knowledge of it in bar and sheet, might be illustrated from a large number of quotations from Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-5.htm">2 Kings 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>; and many others). The "joinings" were the clamps and plates of various size and shape, which held strongly together, whether beams of wood or blocks of stone. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 On occasion of the terrible judgment inflicted on Israel for the sin of David, God pointed out the place where he would have the temple built; upon which, David was excited to make preparations for the great work. David must not build, but he would do all he could; he prepared abundantly before his death. What our hands find to do for God, and our souls, and those round us, let us do it with all our might, before our death; for after death there is no device nor working. And when the Lord refuses to employ us in those services which we desired, we must not be discouraged or idle, but do what we can, though in a humbler sphere.</body></html>
