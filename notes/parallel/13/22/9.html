<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1Chronicles 28:3</a>). The phrase is further explained by what follows.<p><span class= "bld">And I will give him rest from all his enemies round</span> <span class= "bld">about</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the surrounding peoples, who are his natural foes, seeing that they were brought under the yoke by his father, will acquiesce in his dominion. The same words are used, in a somewhat different sense. about David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;">2Samuel 7:1</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-4.htm" title="But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil result.">1Kings 5:4</a> Solomon applies them to himself. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-7.htm" title="When a man's ways please the LORD, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.">Proverbs 16:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Solomon.</span>--The emphatic word. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm" title="And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.">2Samuel 12:24</a>.) The Hebrew is <span class= "ital">Sh?l?m?;</span> for which the LXX. gives S?l?m?n; Syriac, Sh?leim-n; Arabic, Suleiman (same as "Solyman the Magnificent"). The original form of the word had the final <span class= "ital">n</span> which we see in the cognate languages. The Assyrian <span class= "ital">Shalman</span> (in Shalmaneser) and the Moabite Salamanu seem to be identical. The Vulg. has Pacificus (peace-maker). (Comp. the Greek Irenaeeus, the German Friederich, our "Frederick," peaceful.) S?l?mon is the New Testament spelling.<p>It would seem that the original name of Solomon was Jedidiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm" title="And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.">2Samuel 12:25</a>), but posterity, looking back with fond regret to the palmy days of his reign, remembered him only as Shelomoh, "The Peaceful." (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm" title="And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.">1Chronicles 20:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And I will give peace and</span> <span class= "bld">quietness unto Israel in</span> <span class= "bld">his days.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and peace and quietness will I put upon Israel,</span> &c. His name will be a Divine augury of the character of his reign.<p><span class= "bld">Quietness </span>(<span class= "ital">sheqet</span>)<span class= "ital">.--</span>Only here; but compare the cognate verb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm" title="So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.">Judges 5:31</a> : "had rest").<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall be born</span>. This is not the necessary translation of the verb. The form <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> does not express here future time. Solomon was already born when the word of the Lord came to David. On the other hand, we may suppose special emphasis to belong to the clause, His name shall be Solomon. The name designates the man <span class="accented">of peace</span>, and the clause is an announcement, probably intended to throw further into the shade the alternative name <span class="accented">Jedidiah</span>, which also had been divinely given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24, 25</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>22:6-16 David gives Solomon the reason why he should build the temple. Because God named him. Nothing is more powerful to engage us in any service for God, than to know that we are appointed thereto. Because he would have leisure and opportunity to do it. He should have peace and quietness. Where God gives rest, he expects work. Because God had promised to establish his kingdom. God's gracious promises should quicken and strengthen our religious service. David delivered to Solomon an account of the vast preparations he had made for this building; not from pride and vain-glory, but to encourage Solomon to engage cheerfully in the great work. He must not think, by building the temple, to purchase a dispensation to sin; on the contrary, his doing that would not be accepted, if he did not take heed to fulfil the statutes of the Lord. In our spiritual work, as well as in our spiritual warfare, we have need of courage and resolution.</body></html>
