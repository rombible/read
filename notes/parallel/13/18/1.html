The formula of the original history, from which both Samuel and Chronicles have derived a chief part of their substance, has been taken over without modification, after the manner of Oriental compilers. We may, therefore, regard the phrase as a mere mark of transition in the narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Gath and her towns.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">her daughters,</span> that is, outlying dependencies.

The chronicler or his authority has interpreted this curious expression (<span class= "ital">metheg h?'amm?h</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> If at the time Gath was the chief city of Philistia, and David made it recognise his suzerainty by payment of tribute, the phrases of both books are intelligible. In Solomon's time Gath was ruled by a king, Achish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath.">1Kings 2:39</a>), but he was hardly independent of Solomon. ( Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm" title="For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.">1Kings 4:24</a>. ) The general sense is the same if <span class= "ital">metheg h?'amm?h</span> be rendered <span class= "ital">the bridle of the arm</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the sovereign control, or supremacy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines</span>; literally, her <span class="accented">daughters.</span> The compiler of Chronicles gives us this plain statement where, in the parallel place, we find, "took Metheg-ammah," or more exactly, <span class="accented">Metheg-ha-ammah</span>, the explanation of which word (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>) is not yet ascertained. Its literal signification is "the bridle or curb of the mother city," and may mark a special strong position which commanded Gath, or it may describe Gath as owning itself to such a position. Gesenius understands it to mean that David "subjected the metropolis of the Philistines to himself," quoting the Arabian proverb, To <span class="accented">give</span> one s bridle to any one, as equivalent to submitting to him. He quotes also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>. It may be noted that Ammah is spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-24.htm">2 Samuel 2:24</a>) as the name of a hill, otherwise unknown, however. Although David subdued so many places, he reigned over them, <span class="accented">i.e</span>, over many of them, still by "their own kings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>).
