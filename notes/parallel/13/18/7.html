Much doubt has been entertained as to the meaning of this word. Its etymology is uncertain. Gesenius derives it from a root signifying "hardness." For the most part, however, the context of the seven places of its occurrence which he instances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-9.htm">2 Chronicles 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>) favour the rendering "shields," though the quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a> (literally, "fill ye the shields") is not so satisfactory. The wealth of Zobah is, of course, illustrated by these shields of gold. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-17 David's victories. - This chapter is the same as 2Sa 8. Our good fight of faith, under the Captain of our salvation, will end in everlasting triumph and peace.
