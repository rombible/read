Chun.</span>--Two unknown places. The names in Samuel are Betah and Berothai. Tebah occurs as an Aramean name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-24.htm" title="And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.">Genesis 22:24</a>, of which "Tibhath" is a feminine form, and "Betah" probably a corruption. Syriac, "T?bah" and "B?r-thi" in both places. So Arabic of Samuel, "T?b?h" and "Bar-ti" (here "Himsa" and "Baalbec," probably by way of an explanation). The readings of the LXX., "Metebak" (or Masbach) in Samuel, and "Matebeth" here, support Tebah. Vulgate in Samuel, "Bete," but here "Thebath," obviously equivalent <span class= "ital">to</span> Tibhath. "Chun" is doubtless corrupt. All the versions support "Berothai" (LXX., "chosen cities;" comp. Heb., <span class= "ital">b?roth</span>) except Arabic and Vulg. here.<p><span class= "bld">Much</span> <span class= "bld">brass.</span>--<span class= "ital">Copper</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-2.htm" title="Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.">Job 28:2</a>), or <span class= "ital">bronze</span> (an alloy of copper and tin, which was well known to the ancients). Samuel, "copper in abundance" (<span class= "ital">harb?h</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> an older form of expression.<p><span class= "bld">Wherewith Solomon made</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Not in the Hebrew of Samuel, though LXX. adds it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tibhath, and... Chun</span>. These names replace <span class="accented">Betah</span> and <span class="accented">Berothai</span> in the parallel place, in the former case with possibility of orthographic explanation, but not in the latter. The purpose for which David was glad to take their brass is not mentioned in Samuel, but only here. <span class="cmt_word">The brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-14.htm">1 Kings 7:14-47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1-18</a>). In this latter place these subjects will be found treated more fully. This so-called "brazen sea" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>) took the place in Solomon's temple of (he earlier <span class="accented">brazen laver</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>) of the Mosaic ritual (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-38.htm">1 Kings 7:38</a>). It is now called a sea, because of its large size. The use of the original laver is plainly told, for the priests to wash at it their hands and feet before offering sacrifices. It stood in the court of the tabernacle, between the altar and the door. The ten lavers of Solomon's temple were used for washing the sacrificial victims themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>). The brazen sea (which was rather of <span class="accented">copper</span> than brass, however) rested upon twelve standing oxen, three turning their faces to each quarter of the heavens. Its height was five cubits, its diameter ten cubits, the thickness of its metal a handbreadth, and its capacity variously given at two thousand baths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-26.htm">1 Kings 7:26</a>) or three thousand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a>). It was removed from its supports of oxen by Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>), and placed on a pedestal of stone. And it was eventually destroyed by the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13</a>). <span class="accented">And the pillars.</span> (For these pillars of the porch, named <span class="accented">Jachin</span> and <span class="accented">Boaz</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15-17</a>.) <span class="accented">And the vessels of brass.</span> (For these, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40-51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-16.htm">2 Chronicles 4:16-18</a>.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-17 David's victories. - This chapter is the same as 2Sa 8. Our good fight of faith, under the Captain of our salvation, will end in everlasting triumph and peace.
