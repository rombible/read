After the words "he smote Moab," we read there of a partial massacre of the conquered. The emission is scarcely due to any unfair bias on the part of the chronicler. Indeed, as a Jew, possessed with all the national exclusiveness and hatred of the aliens who always misunderstood and sometimes cruelly oppressed his people, he was not likely to regard the slaughter of captive Moabites from a modern point of view. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-21.htm" title="And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,">Ezra 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/6-9.htm" title="And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:">Ezra 6:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-19.htm" title="But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king?">Nehemiah 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-4.htm" title="Then the king said to me, For what do you make request?

Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.">1Chronicles 20:3</a>). (See the prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And the Moabites became.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and they became</span>--viz., <span class= "ital">Moab.</span> The name of the country denotes the people.

Similar notices are common in the Assyrian inscriptions. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm" title="And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.">1Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm" title="And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.">2Kings 3:4</a>; and the famous Moabite inscription of which the fragments are now in the Louvre, and which records Mesha's revolt against the successor of Ahab.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brought gifts</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the light of tribute and of acknowledgment of subjection. There are curious additions to this passage in the parallel place, telling the punishment inflicted on Moab: "He smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">causing them to lie prostrate</span>]; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive." This appears to mean that he put to death two parts of them, and kept the third part alive. The reason of this deliberate and severe punishment is not stated. Once David and the Moabites had been on very different terms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-3.htm">1 Samuel 22:3, 4</a>; but see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-17 David's victories. - This chapter is the same as 2Sa 8.
