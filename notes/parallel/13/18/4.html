Our Authorized Version, in the parallel, gets over the difficulty by inserting "for," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enough for, "a hundred chariots." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-17 David's victories. - This chapter is the same as 2Sa 8. Our good fight of faith, under the Captain of our salvation, will end in everlasting triumph and peace. The happiness of Israel, through David's victories, and just government, faintly shadowed forth the happiness of the redeemed in the realms above.</body></html>
