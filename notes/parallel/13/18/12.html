"Aram" should be read Edom, as the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic have it. Perhaps, also, the text of Samuel is further corrupted. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm" title="For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;">1Kings 11:15</a>. and Psalms 60, title.) From a comparison of the three passages it appears that Edom took advantage of David's absence to invade Judah, whereupon the king detached a column of his forces, and sent them south under Joab and Abishai to repulse the new enemy.<p><span class= "bld">Valley of salt.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2Kings 14:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abishai... slew of the Edomites</span>. The parallel place omits to say that it was by aid of Abishai that David slew these eighteen thousand Edomites. They are there called Syrians, which reading is at all events in keeping with the Aram of the previous verse. Abishai, here named son of Zeruiah, possibly served under "Joab son of Zeruiah" (ver. 15), who is spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>) as very trenchant in this Edomite war, without any mention being made of Abishai. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>.

The word here used for "valley" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>), not the more generic word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>, and signifies rather "ravine." The phrase occurs twice with the article expressed, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5dd;&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>.

The real situation of this place is still doubtful. Since the time of the German traveller Geethen ('Reisen,' 2:356), and of Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:109), it has been generally assumed to be a tract of land extending some six miles south of the Dead Sea, and bounded at that distance by the range of hills which there runs across the country; but beside the consideration that the word "ravine" could not describe that tract of country, there are others very unfavourable to the supposition (see these carefully stated by Grove, in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1097). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/18.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>18:1-17 David's victories. - This chapter is the same as 2Sa 8.
