(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm" title="And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.">2Samuel 15:18</a>, where the Cherethites and Pelethites are mentioned along with a corps of Gittites.)

But this theory seems to be opposed to the facts of history. Under the monarchy the priests were brought into close relations with the king, owing to their judicial duties; and the chief priest of a royal sanctuary became one of the great officials of state (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-11.htm" title="For thus Amos said, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.">Amos 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-13.htm" title="But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.">Amos 7:13</a>). Such a position would be of sufficient importance to be filled by the princes of the blood. The chronicler, writing from the point of view of a later age, has substituted for the original term a phrase that would not offend contemporary feeling.
