David addresses God as "my Lord, Jehovah;" just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-4.htm" title="Go and tell David my servant, Thus said the LORD, You shall not build me an house to dwell in:">1Chronicles 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-7.htm" title="Now therefore thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus said the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that you should be ruler over my people Israel:">1Chronicles 17:7</a>, God speaks of David as "my servant." (Comp. the frequent style of the Assyrian kings, who speak of their wars as undertaken in the service of the gods their lords.)<p><span class= "bld">Mine house.</span>--My family.<p><span class= "bld">Hitherto.</span>--To this pitch of greatness. With this and the next verse, compare David's last words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-5.htm" title="Although my house be not so with God; yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.">2Samuel 23:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-27.</span> - These verses contain David's response to the gracious communication which had been made to him, and thanksgivings for the promise made to him as regards his seed. His appreciation of the contents of that promise is expressed in a manner which would seem to indicate that he was not altogether untaught, even then, by the Spirit of some of the deeper significance of the far-reaching promise. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sat before the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before the ark. It has surprised many that it should be said that David sat before the Lord, in the act of prayer or devotion. But this was not altogether unusual (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>) in the first place; and then, secondly, it is not quite clear that this <span class="accented">is</span> said. Possibly he sat awaiting first some such token as he might know how to construe into the presence of Jehovah, and into his gracious vouchsafing to give him audience, and thereupon he may have altered his attitude. Confessedly, however, the other is the morn natural reading. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-27 David's purposes; God's gracious promises. - This chapter is the same as 2Sa 7. See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.</body></html>
