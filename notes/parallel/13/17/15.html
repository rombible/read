Neither the compiler of Samuel, however, nor the chronicler professes to give an exact report of the words of Nathan, as if they had been taken down on the spot, as they were uttered, by some shorthand reporter. The modern demand for literal accuracy was unknown to Oriental antiquity. Where the two narratives vary, sometimes Samuel, sometimes the Chronicle, contains the more original form of the tradition. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-15.htm" title="According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.">1Chronicles 17:15</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-17.htm" title="According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.">2Samuel 7:17</a>), in fact, seems to imply that the essence rather than the actual words of the oracle is given.<p>2. David's prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/17-16.htm" title="And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me till now?">1Chronicles 17:16-27</a>). The remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-15.htm" title="According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.">1Chronicles 17:15</a> apply generally to this section also. The prayer undoubtedly breathes the genuine Davidic spirit, even if it be merely an ideal soliloquy. But why may not David himself have recorded the substance of it as a memorial?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-27 David's purposes; God's gracious promises. - This chapter is the same as 2Sa 7. See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.</body></html>
