(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-21.htm" title="Have you not known? have you not heard? has it not been told you from the beginning? have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?">Isaiah 40:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-21.htm" title="Tell you, and bring them near; yes, let them take counsel together: who has declared this from ancient time? who has told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Savior; there is none beside me.">Isaiah 45:21</a>.) That which follows is a sort of ironical inversion of David's wish to build a house for the Lord. The term "house" is figurative (offspring), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-1.htm" title="Except the LORD build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman wakes but in vain.">Psalm 127:1</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-3.htm" title="And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear on my knees, that I may also have children by her.">Genesis 30:3</a>.) The reading of Samuel is, "And Jehovah hath [now] told thee [by my mouth] that a house will Jehovah make for thee." This looks original, with its rare construction of the perfect, which the chronicler has altered; its repetition of the most holy Name; and its less exact "make," which Chronicles improves into "build," with an eye to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-4.htm" title="Go and tell David my servant, Thus said the LORD, You shall not build me an house to dwell in:">1Chronicles 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-6.htm" title="Wherever I have walked with all Israel, spoke I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have you not built me an house of cedars?">1Chronicles 17:6</a>, as well as to the play on the word (<span class= "ital">b?n?h,</span> build; <span class= "ital">b?nim,</span> sons).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - This verse should read on continuously with the preceding, as far as to the word "enemies."

See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.</body></html>
