The word "law" (<span class= "ital">tor?h</span>) has been supposed to mean <span class= "ital">manner</span> or <span class= "ital">custom</span> in this place, but it is not used in that sense elsewhere. Its strict sense is <span class= "ital">teaching.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm" title="Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.">Isaiah 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-20.htm" title="To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.">Isaiah 8:20</a>, where the oracles delivered to the prophet are called <span class= "ital">tor?h.</span>) The rendering therefore is, <span class= "ital">and this</span> (thy gracious revelation) <span class= "ital">is a lesson to mankind.</span> Our text demands one slight alteration, in accordance with this. Read <span class= "ital">tor?h</span> for <span class= "ital">tor,</span> and then we may translate: <span class= "ital">"and thou regardest me</span> (LXX., <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-48.htm" title="For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from now on all generations shall call me blessed.">Luke 1:48</a>) <span class= "ital">like man's teaching</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-8.htm" title="I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go: I will guide you with my eye.">Psalm 32:8</a>) <span class= "ital">that bringeth up</span> (same verb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-2.htm" title="And say, What is your mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.">Ezekiel 19:2</a>), <span class= "ital">O Lord God;"</span> that is to say, Thy revelation is a part of my moral discipline, like the instruction which men give their children. David was not allowed to build the Temple, which was so far a check; but encouragement was added to the prohibition by the wisdom of his heavenly Teacher. If we might assume the other sense of <span class= "ital">tor?h,</span> we might render: <span class= "ital">and thou regardest me after the manner of men that exalteth,</span> that is, as human benefactors help on those whom they favour. The old versions give no help.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - David here makes a clear sad very just difference between all that had been done for him, and the very great prospect now in addition put before him<span class="cmt_word">: Thou... hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou hast treated me, or dealt with me, in this promise as though [ had been of high rank indeed. The parallel reading is very concise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-19.htm">2 Samuel 7:19</a>), and perhaps somewhat obscure, "And is this the manner [or, 'law'] of man?" or, "And this is to be a law of man," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this continuity of a great while to come. Elliptical as this reading may seem, there is no real difficulty in feeling its essential harmony with the passage before us. David's unfeigned surprise and joy in the "<span class="cmt_word">great while to come"</span> nature of the promises made to him and his house overpower all else in his estimation. It is, indeed, a most opportune emphasis that he lays upon this element of the full promise, and accords exceptionally well with our later knowledge and brighter light. Our Authorized Version rendering throws out sufficiently this surprise, and gives not inadequately the drift of the passage. The continuity and exaltedness of the promise, which was only fully realized in the greater Son of David, the Christ, might well astonish David. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-27 David's purposes; God's gracious promises. - This chapter is the same as 2Sa 7. See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.</body></html>
