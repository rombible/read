Literally, <span class= "ital">In all that</span> . . .<p><span class= "bld">With </span>(in)<span class= "bld"> all Israel.</span>--Samuel, "in (among) all the sons of Israel." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/26-11.htm" title="And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-15.htm" title="You shall not deliver to his master the servant which is escaped from his master to you:">Deuteronomy 23:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The judges of Israel.</span>--Samuel has "tribes." The term "judges" would be more intelligible in later times, and has probably been substituted for the more difficult original expression. The following clause seems to refer to individual rulers, but is not really incompatible with a reference to the ascendency or hegemony of different tribes at different epochs of Israelite history. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-4.htm" title="However, the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he has chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:">1Chronicles 28:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-67.htm" title="Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:">Psalm 78:67-68</a>.) The word "tribe" (<span class= "ital">sh?bet</span>) might only denote <span class= "ital">clan,</span> or <span class= "ital">house,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-12.htm" title="And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?">Judges 20:12</a> (Heb.).<p><span class= "bld">To feed.</span>--<span class= "ital">Shepherd,</span> or <span class= "ital">tend--i.e.,</span> to govern. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm" title="From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.">Psalm 78:71</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The judges of Israel</span>. The substitution of the Hebrew character <span class="accented">beth</span> for <span class="accented">pe</span>, in the word "judges," would make it "tribes," and bring it into harmony with the parallel place. But the succeeding clause, <span class="cmt_word">Whom I commanded to feed my people</span>, would rather suggest that the parallel place, which adds the same clause, should be brought into harmony with this (see again ver. 10 of this chapter). The general meaning and the gracious spirit underlying it is evident enough. God had never made a suggestion to tribe, or leader of tribe, nor to judge, who had been temporarily raised up to lead, and so to feed, all his people Israel, to build him an house. He had shared their lot, and had shared it unmurmuringly. He also "had not opened his mouth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67-71</a>). Note also the expression, "I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16</a>). It is to be remarked that we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8</a> and 1 Chron 28:3 the fuller causes why David was not to be permitted to be the builder of the house. It is not apparent why those causes are not recited here. The same remark applies to the parallel place. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>17:1-27 David's purposes; God's gracious promises. - This chapter is the same as 2Sa 7. See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.</body></html>
