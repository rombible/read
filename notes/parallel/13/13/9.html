For Chidon, the parallel place has <span class="accented">Nachon</span>; possibly these are two names of the same place, or one form is a corruption of the ether; but there is nothing to determine for us which. Owing to the meaning of Nachon being "prepared," the version of Aquila is "to the prepared threshingfloor," with which the Jonathan Targum agrees, and (for this Chronicles passage) the Joseph Targum gives <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>. The <span class="accented">threshing-</span>floor was a circular plot of hard ground, from fifty to one hundred feet in diameter, on which the oxen trampled out the grain. Threshingfloors evidently often became landmarks, and helped to designate places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The oxen stumbled</span>. In the parallel place the Authorized Version renders "shook it." The Hebrew verb is the same (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>) in both places. Its elementary meanings are "to strike" and "to throw down." Perhaps the meaning is near the Vulgate rendering, c<span class="accented">alcitrabant</span>, and equivalent to the rendering, <span class="accented">became restive.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:6-14 Let the sin of Uzza warn all to take heed of presumption, rashness, and irreverence, in dealing with holy things; and let none think that a good design will justify a bad action. Let the punishment of Uzza teach us not to dare to trifle with God in our approaches to him; yet let us, through Christ, come boldly to the throne of grace. If the gospel be to some a savour of death unto death, as the ark was to Uzza, yet let us receive it in the love of it, and it will be to us a savour of life unto life.</body></html>
