The original text was plainly the same, whether the chronicler drew directly from the Book of Samuel, or from another source. Such differences as appear consist of abridgments, paraphrases, and corrections.<p><span class= "bld">All Israel.</span>--Samuel, "All the people that were with him."<p><span class= "bld">To Baalah.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-60.htm" title="Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:60</a>, "Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim." "Baa?s town" was doubtless the original name. "Town of woods" describes the position of the place. Our text appears more correct than that of Samuel, which has, "And David rose and went, and all the people that were with him, from BaaleJudah." The Targum, LXX., and Syriac, translate that which the Authorised Version gives as a proper name, "The people that were with him of the cities lords men of Judah." If this be right, perhaps "Baalah" has fallen out of the text of Samuel owing to its resemblance to the word <span class= "ital">baale</span>. lords.

The Israelites in later days avoided all mention of the Divine name of <span class= "ital">Jehovah</span>, and substituted <span class= "ital">hashsh?m</span> "the Name" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-16.htm" title="And he that blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.">Leviticus 24:16</a>, and the Third Commandment). A comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm" title="And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwells between the cherubim.">2Samuel 6:2</a>, however, suggests that a word meaning "upon it" (<span class= "ital">'?law</span>), has fallen out. In that case the literal rendering will be, <span class= "ital">upon which</span> (i.e., the Ark) <span class= "ital">the Name</span> (of Jehovah) <span class= "ital">is called=</span> which is called by the name (of Jehovah). The Ark was often called "the Ark of Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-3.htm" title="And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to his place, which he had prepared for it.">1Chronicles 15:3</a>). The Hebrew and Targum of Samuel favour this. Some MSS. of Chron. read "there" (<span class= "ital">sh?m</span>) instead of "name" (<span class= "ital">sh?m</span>). This, gives the meaning, <span class= "ital">who is invoked there</span> (at the Ark).

A third name of this same place, <span class="accented">Kirjath-baal</span>, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-60.htm">Joshua 15:60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-14.htm">Joshua 18:14</a>.

We read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17-27</a> how the men of Kirjath-jearim had been made by Joshua "hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord." Hither to this Kirjath-jearim the ark had been conveyed from Bethshemesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</a>), and here it "abode" long time, "for it was twenty years." Perhaps the word "abode" in this passage may be equivalent to abode <span class="accented">unmoved</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>.18, 19). For though the chronology from the death of Eli, through the remainder of Samuel's career and of Saul's, seems almost hopelessly uncertain, yet it would appear certain that the interval exceeded twenty years, to the time that David now takes in hand to bring home, as it were, the ark. <span class="cmt_word">The ark of God, the Lord</span>. Though the Authorized Version of this passage is better and cleverer than that of the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>), yet it is left somewhat obscure. The comma should follow the name God. Jehovah sitting upon the cherubim then follows as a clause in apposition, while the last three words (<span class="accented">as the name is called</span>, rather than whose name) state that clause to contain "the Name of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-8.htm">1 Samuel 6:8</a>).

But there are abundant objections to this. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:6-14 Let the sin of Uzza warn all to take heed of presumption, rashness, and irreverence, in dealing with holy things; and let none think that a good design will justify a bad action. Let the punishment of Uzza teach us not to dare to trifle with God in our approaches to him; yet let us, through Christ, come boldly to the throne of grace. If the gospel be to some a savour of death unto death, as the ark was to Uzza, yet let us receive it in the love of it, and it will be to us a savour of life unto life.</body></html>
