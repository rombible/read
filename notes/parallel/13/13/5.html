Hamath was the seat of an ancient kingdom, independent of, but friendly to David. The prophet Amos (eighth century B.C. ) calls it Hamath Rabbah, Great Hamath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm" title="Pass you to Calneh, and see; and from there go you to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?">Amos 6:2</a>). A revived interest attaches to Hamath in our day, owing to the discovery of five curious inscriptions at <span class= "ital">Hamah</span>, written in a peculiar hieroglyphic character, which has been pronounced to be Hittite, but still awaits decipherment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All Israel</span>. The parallel gives the number as thirty thousand men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shihor of Egypt</span>. According to Gesenius, this Shihor is from root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;</span> meaning "to be turbid" or "black" (so Latin <span class="accented">melo</span>, from the Greek; Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:278, 291; Catullus, 67:33). There can surely be little doubt that it is the river Nile which is here spoken of, after comparison of the following passages: - <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>. Though others, quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a> and Joshua 19:26, and interpreting Shihor generically as applicable to any dark, turbid stream, make it the modern <span class="accented">Wady el-Arish</span>, However, the parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>, does not necessarily dissever the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), but rather tends to identify them. The entering of Hemath; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the way to Hamath (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-7.htm">Numbers 34:7, 8</a>). Hamath was one of the great cities of the Orontes valley, in Upper Syria, which formed the boundary in especial of the empire of Solomon. This valley is watered by the Orontes, the river of Antioch, a river remarkable for its abundant spring (situate immediately north of the source of the Leontes), which won for it the name, among all the other springs of Syria, of "The Spring," and remarkable for "the length of its course, the volume of its waters, and the rich vegetation of its banks." It is <span class="accented">the</span> one of the four rivers which take their rise beneath the heights of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon which becomes really worthy of the name of river, the other three, viz. the Jordan, the Leontes or modern <span class="accented">Litany</span> of Phoeicia, and the Abana or modern <span class="accented">Barada</span> of Damascus, more resembling the nature of the mountain stream. This river was to the ancient Romans "the representative of Syria, as the Timings might be said to be of England, and in later times the region formed the chief point of contact between this part of Asia and the West" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 414, <span class="accented">e</span>,<span class="accented">f</span>, edit. 1866). The <span class="accented">kingdom</span> of Hamath comprised the tract of this valley of the Orontes, skirted by the hills separating the Leontes from the Orontes, and extending to the Pass of Daphne below Antioch. <span class="accented">Riblah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>) lies on the east bank of the Orontes, thirty-five miles north-east of Baal-bek, or Baal-gad. The people of Hamath were of the race of Ham, of the descendants of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), and are not to be reckoned as of Phoenician origin. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:1-5 David said not, What magnificent thing shall I do now? or, What pleasant thing? but, What pious thing? that he might have the comfort and benefit of that sacred oracle. Let us bring the ark to us, that it may be a blessing to us. Those who honour God, profit themselves. It is the wisdom of those setting out in the world, to take God's ark with them. Those are likely to go on in the favour of God, who begin in the fear of God.</body></html>
