The parallel of this passage exhibits "before the Lord." <span class="cmt_word">With all their might</span>. See the evident mistake of the parallel ("on all manner of instruments made of firwood," literally, <span class="accented">with all firwoods</span>) <span class="accented">through</span> similarity of the Hebrew characters. <span class="cmt_word">Cymbals and... trumpets</span>. Of the five names of musical instruments, the same in number in both passages, the first three are the same in the Hebrew, but these last two are different words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e6;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> here for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> A variation of this particular kind again indicates with some decisiveness the different character and the number of the sources from which the writers of the Books of Samuel and those of Chronicles took. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:6-14 Let the sin of Uzza warn all to take heed of presumption, rashness, and irreverence, in dealing with holy things; and let none think that a good design will justify a bad action. Let the punishment of Uzza teach us not to dare to trifle with God in our approaches to him; yet let us, through Christ, come boldly to the throne of grace. If the gospel be to some a savour of death unto death, as the ark was to Uzza, yet let us receive it in the love of it, and it will be to us a savour of life unto life.</body></html>
