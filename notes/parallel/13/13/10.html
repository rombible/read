For this Samuel has 'al hashshal, an obscure phrase, occurring nowhere else in the Old Testament. The similarity of letters in the two phrases can hardly be accidental, but whether the chronicler has given the original text of the passage as he found it preserved in his source, or whether he has himself made a guess at the true reading, cannot be determined. The Syriac of Samuel reads, "because he put forth his hand;" and so the Arabic, adding, "to the ark." The Targum, "because he sinned" (using a word like hashshal). The Vat. LXX. omits the phrase.<p><span class= "bld">Before God.</span>--Samuel, "by the ark of God." This explains the same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm" title="And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.">1Chronicles 13:8</a>.

Uzza was probably not a priest or Levite, and it is so distinctly said his sin consisted in <span class="cmt_word">putting his hand to the ark</span>, that perhaps the direction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a> may be sufficient account of the matter. Special injunction had been given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14, 15</a>) that the poles with which to bear it should not be taken out of the rings, but be always stationary there. If we suppose that it was <span class="accented">not</span> a question of the ark being absolutely overthrown, but simply of its riding unsteadily, his presumptuousness would <span class="accented">not</span> have the further defence of an instinctive impulse. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>13:6-14 Let the sin of Uzza warn all to take heed of presumption, rashness, and irreverence, in dealing with holy things; and let none think that a good design will justify a bad action. Let the punishment of Uzza teach us not to dare to trifle with God in our approaches to him; yet let us, through Christ, come boldly to the throne of grace. If the gospel be to some a savour of death unto death, as the ark was to Uzza, yet let us receive it in the love of it, and it will be to us a savour of life unto life.</body></html>
