Zerubbabel (LXX., <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span>), means <span class= "ital">born at Babel.</span> His father is appropriately named Pedaiah (<span class= "ital">Iah hath redeemed</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Zerubbabel is called son of Shealtiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm" title="In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,">Haggai 1:1</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm" title="Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.">Ezra 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-2.htm" title="Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.">Ezra 5:2</a>--part of the chronicle it should be remembered; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a>). Hence some expositors, ancient and modern, have assumed that the six persons named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-18.htm" title="Malchiram also, and Pedaiah, and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah.">1Chronicles 3:18</a>, including Pedaiah, the father of Zerubbabel, were sons, not brothers of Salathiel (Shealtiel). In this way they bring Zerubbabel into the direct line of descent from Shealtiel. But our Hebrew text, though peculiar, can hardly mean this. It makes Zerubbabel the son of Pedaiah, and nephew of Shealtiel. If Zerubbabel, for reasons unknown, became adopted son and heir of Shealtiel, his uncle, the seemingly discordant statements of the different passages before us are all reconciled; while that of our text is the more exact.<p><span class= "bld">And</span> <span class= "bld">the sons of Zerubbabel.</span>--The Hebrew received text has "<span class= "ital">and the son.</span>" This is not to be altered, although some MSS. have the plural. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-21.htm" title="And the sons of Hananiah; Pelatiah, and Jesaiah: the sons of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, the sons of Obadiah, the sons of Shechaniah.">1Chronicles 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-23.htm" title="And the sons of Neariah; Elioenai, and Hezekiah, and Azrikam, three.">1Chronicles 3:23</a>.) This use of the singular is characteristic of the present genealogical fragment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,">1Chronicles 3:17-18</a>), "And the sons of Jeconiah captive--Salathiel his son, and Malchiram," &c.<p><span class= "bld">Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister.</span>--This seems to mean that the three were the offspring of one wife.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Pedaiah is now given as the father of <span class="cmt_word">Zeraubabel</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Shimei</span>. Of the latter of these nothing else is known, unless Lord Hervey's theory below be correct. The former is a great name - its derivation perhaps doubtful. Strictly it signifies "scattered to Babylon," but (Gesenius, 'Lexicon') if the initial part of the word be strengthened into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, the signification might be "born in Babylon." We have in this name another instance of the treatment just commented on with regard to the name Salathiel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-28.htm">Luke 3:28</a>. Zerubbabel is elsewhere invariably described as <span class="accented">son</span> of Salathiel, or Shealtiel; but as the genealogy of St. Luke gives the <span class="accented">natural</span> descent of Salathiel as from Neri, so does our genealogy in this one place give us the natural descent of Zerubbabel as from Pedaiah, one of Salathiel's brothers; while all other passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-12.htm">Haggai 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>)give us that for which the genealogical table is chiefly designed, viz. the matter of <span class="accented">succession</span>, according to which Zerubbabel would be-shown as <span class="accented">son</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> link of succession, following on Shealtiel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Meshullam</span>.
