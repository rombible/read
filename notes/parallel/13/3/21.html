The LXX. have rendered the whole verse thus: "And sons of Anania; Phalettia, and Jesias his son, Raphal his son, Orna his son, Abdia his son (Sechenias his son.)" The Syriac reads: "Sons of Hananiah: Pelatiah and Ushaiah. Arphaia his son, Arnun his son, Ubia his son--viz., Ushaia's; and his son, viz., Shechaniah's Shemaiah," &c. The difference between "sons" and "his son" in Hebrew writing is simply that between <span class= "ital">y</span> and <span class= "ital">w.</span> (See Note on 1 Chronicles 1)<p>This various reading presents a form of genealogy like that which prevails in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/3-10.htm" title="And Solomon's son was Rehoboam, Abia his son, Asa his son, Jehoshaphat his son,">1Chronicles 3:10-16</a>, and occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,">1Chronicles 3:17</a>, at the beginning of the present section. But it is probable that this reading is really an ancient correction of the Hebrew text, which, as it stands, appears to leave undefined the relation between Hananiah and the four families mentioned in this verse. The truth, however, would seem to be that the expression "the sons of Hananiah" includes not only Pelatiah and Jesaiah, but also the four families named after Rephaiah, Arnan, Obadiah, and Shechaniah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-42.htm" title="Now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were, Mesha his firstborn, which was the father of Ziph; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron.">1Chronicles 2:42</a>, and Note). The four founders of these families were perhaps brothers of Pelatiah and Jesaiah, though not necessarily so; for these families may have been subdivisions of those of Pelatiah and Jesaiah.<p><span class= "bld">Rephaiah.</span>--<span class= "ital">Iah healeth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm" title="Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD binds up the breach of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.">Isaiah 30:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm" title="And said, If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases on you, which I have brought on the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that heals you.">Exodus 15:26</a>). See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-20.htm" title="And Hashubah, and Ohel, and Berechiah, and Hasadiah, Jushabhesed, five.">1Chronicles 3:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The Hebrew text, followed by the Vulgate, not followed by the Septuagint, reads here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>. Yet some manuscripts have the plural "sons," from which comes our Authorized Version. The indication is important. It is doubly interesting, as the only indication in our Hebrew text that tends to give confirmation to the very noteworthy differences of the Septuagint Version. For although this last, apparently somewhat perversely, begins its version with "sons," which plural does not so well suit its sequel, instead of the "son" of our Hebrew text, which would suit it, yet it proceeds with a translation which must have been obtained from another text, such text again suiting properly the <span class="accented">singular</span> - "son" <span class="accented">-</span> of our Hebrew. The form of its translation is analogous to that marked in the words of vers. 10-14. "The <span class="accented">sons</span> [sic <span class="accented">son</span>] of <span class="cmt_word">Ananiah, Pelatiah</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Jesaiah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Rephaiah</span> <span class="accented">his son</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Arnan</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Obadiah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son, <span class="cmt_word">Shechaniah</span> <span class="accented">his</span> son," making six (presumably) consecutive generations. This, therefore, is the reading which (if correct) might carry down the genealogy to the times of Alexander the Great, and indeed to a time a quarter of a century later. And in doing so, it would certify this entry as of later date than probably any other of the canon! If we reject this position and reading, we have to get over the term, repeated several times, <span class="cmt_word">the sons of</span>. To do this, Bertheau <span class="accented">suggests</span> that the intention of our passage was, from the name Rephaiah inclusive, not to mention the individual four brothers' names, but to mention them as four distinguished families among the posterity of David - an attempt at explanation certainly not satisfactory. The conclusion of the matter <span class="accented">is</span>, that in this twenty-first verse we have difficulties in either alternative, not satisfactorily explained. Either we have the names in all of six brothers, being "<span class="accented">sons</span> of Hananiah" - the last four of whom are styled, not by their individual names, but as heads of families; or we have six lineal descendants from Hananiah. If this last supposition were correct, calculate a royal <span class="accented">succession</span> at the lowest average (say something under twenty years), and the genealogy, including what follows in the remaining verses of the chapter, will bring <span class="accented">us</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> above, to a date that covers the whole life of Alexander the Great. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-24 Genealogies. - Of all the families of Israel, none were so illustrious as the family of David: here we have a full account of it. From this family, as concerning the flesh, Christ came. The attentive observer will perceive that the children of the righteous enjoy many advantages.</body></html>
