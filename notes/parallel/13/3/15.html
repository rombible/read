If age were considered, the order would be Jehoiakim, Shallum, Zedekiah; if the actual succession, it would be, Shallum, Jehoiakim, Zedekiah. The order of the text may have been influenced by the two considerations--(1) That Jehoiakim and Zedekiah each enjoyed a reign of eleven years, while Shallum reigned only three months; (2) That Shallum and Zedekiah were full brothers, both being sons of Hamutal, whereas Jehoiakim was born of another of Josiah's wives, viz., Zebudah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The first thing to be observed in this verse is that, though it lays stress on the mention of the name of Josiah's firstborn of four sons as <span class="cmt_word">Johanan</span>, this is the only mention of him. Some, however, have taken the Jehoahaz of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a> for him. Next, that <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiakim</span> was not the original name of the next brother, but a name slightly altered by Pharaoh-Necho from Eliakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>). If the dates of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31, 34, 36</a>, be correct, there is no doubt that, though Jehoiakim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Eliakim, reigned after Jehoahaz, yet he was the elder, and is in his right place in the present passage. Next, that <span class="cmt_word">Shallum</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-11.htm">Jeremiah 20:11</a>) is another name of the Jehoa-haz of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30, 31, 34</a>, and several other places. It is possible that he finds the last place amid the four brothers of this verse because of his probable usurpation of the throne, in violation of the right of his elder brother, Jehoiakim, and the early fall he met with in consequence. Lastly, that the fourth brother, <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span>, whose name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>) was originally Mattha-niah, was put on the throne by the King of Babylon, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>) after that his nephew Jehoiachin (who could have no son old enough to succeed) was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12, 15, 17</a>) carried captive to Babylon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-24 Genealogies. - Of all the families of Israel, none were so illustrious as the family of David: here we have a full account of it.
