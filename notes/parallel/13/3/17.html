This section is peculiar to the chronicle.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">Assir.</span>--This word means prisoner, captive; literally, <span class= "ital">bondman.</span> It so occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm" title="To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-22.htm" title="And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.">Isaiah 24:22</a>. Accordingly the verse may be rendered, "And the sons of Jeconiah when captive--Shealtiel (was) his son." This translation (1) accords with the Masoretic punctuation, which connects the term <span class= "ital">assir</span> with Jeconiah; and (2) accounts for the double reference to the offspring of Jeconiah, first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm" title="And the sons of Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son, Zedekiah his son.">1Chronicles 3:16</a>, "Zedekiah his son," and then again here. Zedekiah is thus separated from the sons born to Jeconiah in captivity. The strongest apparent objection against such a rendering is that the expression "the sons of Jeconiah the captive" would require the definite article to be prefixed to the word <span class= "ital">assir.</span> No doubt it would; but then "the sons of Jeconiah the captive" is not what the chronicler intended to say. He has said what he meant--viz., "the sons of Jeconiah <span class= "ital">when in captivity</span>" or "<span class= "ital">as</span> <span class= "ital">a</span> <span class= "ital">captive.</span>" The Talmudic treatise, <span class= "ital">Sanhedrin,</span> gives "Assir his son;" but another, the <span class= "ital">Sedw Olam,</span> does not mention Assir, who is likewise wanting in the genealogy of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a>; see the Notes there).<p><span class= "bld">Salathiel.</span>--The form in the LXX., <span class= "greekheb">????????</span><span class= "ital">;</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a>, Heb., <span class= "ital">Shealti-el</span> ("request of God"): <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-12.htm" title="Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.">Haggai 1:12</a>, Shalti-el.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-24.</span> - These verses contain a line of descent brought down to a point not merely posterior to the Exile, but possibly reaching to the time of Alexander. This line, however, through Solomon is lost so soon as the first name, that of Assir, is passed; Salathiel (Authorized Version)or Shealtiel, being descended from David, not through Solomon, but through Nathan, whole brother to Solomon. This Assir is not known from any parallel passage; and Luther, Starke, Bertheau, and others, followed by Zoekler (in Lange, 'Comm. O.T.') translate the name as <span class="accented">captive</span>, applying it to Jeconiah. Not all their reasons, however, <span class="accented">for</span> this, outweigh one which must be pronounced <span class="accented">against</span> it, viz. the absence of the article. The Septuagint and Vulgate versions agree with our own. The greater probability might be that Assir derived his name from being born after Jeconiah was in captivity, and such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>, may throw some light upon the extinction of Solomon's line here, and the transfer of the succession (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-11.htm">Numbers 27:11</a>, and see interesting note on the present place in 'Speaker's Commentary'). Salathiel is the Authorized Version incorrect rendering of the Hebrew Shealtiel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a> it is said, "And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>, "Salathiel, which was <span class="accented">the son</span> of Neri." Now, Neri was in the direct line of Nathan. There seems only one way of reconciling these statements - and the method removes similar difficulties in other places also - viz, to distinguish between the descent <span class="accented">natural</span> and the descent <span class="accented">royal</span>, and then acknowledge that the former was swallowed up, where necessary, of the latter. One as decisive instance of this kind as that before us is most useful to rule other cases. (For an important allusion to the house and family of Nathan's descendants, as well known at the time, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a> - a passage probably dating a few years previous to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.), <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-24 Genealogies. - Of all the families of Israel, none were so illustrious as the family of David: here we have a full account of it. From this family, as concerning the flesh, Christ came. The attentive observer will perceive that the children of the righteous enjoy many advantages.</body></html>
