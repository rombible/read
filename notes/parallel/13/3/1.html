The sons and mothers agree with those of the parallel passage in Sam., with the one exception of the second son, who is here called Daniel, but in Samuel, Chileab. The LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;">2Samuel 3:3</a>) has <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>, which may represent Heb. <span class= "ital">Delaiah </span>(<span class= "ital">Iah hath freed</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> though in our <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-24.htm" title="And the sons of Elioenai were, Hodaiah, and Eliashib, and Pelaiah, and Akkub, and Johanan, and Dalaiah, and Anani, seven.">1Chronicles 3:24</a> that name is spelt <span class= "greekheb">???????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> or <span class= "greekheb">??????</span>. In the present passage the Vatican LXX. has <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>, the Alex. <span class= "greekheb">????????</span><span class= "ital">.</span> Perhaps Daniel is a corruption of Delaiah, as this name recurs in the line of David. Chileab may have had a second name (comp. Uzziah-Azariah, Mattaniah-Zedekiah), especially as Chileab appears to be a nickname, meaning "dog." (Comp. the Latin Canidius, Caninius, as a family name.)<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Amnon.</span>--For his story see 2 Samuel 13<p><span class= "bld">Of Ahinoam.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to Ahin.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-43.htm" title="David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.">1Samuel 25:43</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The second Daniel of Abigail the Carmelitess.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">A second, Daniel, to Abigail, &c.</span> Sam. adds, "wife of Nabal the Carmelite." (See 1 Samuel 25 for her story.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - The whole of this chapter is occupied with the descendants of <span class="cmt_word">David</span>: the first nine verses of it with his own sons, classified according to the place of their birth, Hebron or Jerusalem; the remaining verses with the line of kings of his house to Jeconiah and Zedekiah (ver. 16), the grandsons of Zerubbabel (ver. 21), and descendants of Shechaniah (ver. 24). To the seven years and six months (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>) of David's reign at Hebron six sons belong, each of a different mother. To the thirty and throe years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) of his reign at Jerusalem belong other thirteen sons, viz. four of one mother, <span class="cmt_word">Bethshua</span>, and nine of other mothers, whose names are not given. The list of the six Hebron sons, with their mothers, is nearly identical with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>, although the differences, slight as they are, would of the two indicate our list here rather as <span class="accented">not</span> copied than copied thence. The only noticeable difference, however, is in the name of the second son, announced here as <span class="cmt_word">Daniel</span>, instead of Chileab, while the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This, together with the circumstance that one word would, as regards the Hebrew characters, comparatively easily convert into the other. renders it probable that it is merely a corrupt text or text obscure at this point which has occasioned the difference. The meaning of the name Daniel, put side by side with what we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>, 25:39, suggests strongly that it is the right name of the two. It was a name likely to be given by David to his first child by <span class="cmt_word">Abigail</span>. Additional suspicion is thrown on the name Chileab through the three last letters of it, "<span class="accented">leab</span>," constituting also the three first of the very next word," <span class="accented">of Abigail"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>) which looks very much like the over-haste of the pen uncorrected. It is remarkable that the Syriac and Arabic versions translate "Caleb," both here and in the parallel passage. For the sons born in Jerusalem we have all three parallel lists at command, and the variations are rather greater. The other two lists are in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4-7</a>. The first of these omits <span class="cmt_word">Eliphelet</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Nogah</span> (possibly they died young or without issue), and the latter calls Eliphelet <span class="accented">Elpalet</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>). Again, <span class="cmt_word">Shimeah</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Elishama</span> in our passage must yield, overruled by the consent of the other two, to Shammuah and Elishua. Again, it is to be noticed that the name <span class="cmt_word">Eliada</span> (God (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), on occasion of its <span class="accented">latest</span> occurence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>), appears as <span class="accented">Beel</span>iada (the Lord (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), preserving therein probably its <span class="accented">earlier form</span>, viz. that used before a settled bad sense had come to be attached to the word Baal (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-24 Genealogies. - Of all the families of Israel, none were so illustrious as the family of David: here we have a full account of it.
