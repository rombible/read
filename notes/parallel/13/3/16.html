Hence the supposition that "Zedekiah his son" means "Zedekiah his successor" on the throne. (Comp. margin.) But (1) the phrase "his son" has its natural sense throughout the preceding list; and (2) there really is nothing against the apparent statement of the text that Jeconiah the king had a son named Zedekiah, after his great-uncle. As, like Johanan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1Chronicles 3:15</a>), he did not come to the throne, this younger Zedekiah is not mentioned elsewhere. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,">1Chronicles 3:17</a>, Note.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Of the above four brothers, sons of Josiah, the second, Jehoiakim, or Eliakim, had a son called <span class="cmt_word">Jeconiah</span>, or Jehoiachin - essentially the same word. He was eighteen years of age when he succeeded his father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>). A touching glimpse is given of him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>. His name is shortened to Coniah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a> and Jeremiah 37:1, though elsewhere in the same prophet, Jeconiah, and in one place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>), Jehoiachin. The name of <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span> occasions difficulty in this verse. In the first instance, following the examples of vers. 10-14, we should presume that this Zedekiah is set forth as a son of Jeconiah, and as it is not said that he <span class="accented">reigned</span> after Jeconiah (for it was undoubtedly Jeconiah's uncle Zedekiah who reigned after him), we need only have read it as a statement of one of his sons. Against this, however, there are two tolerably decisive considerations; for, <span class="accented">first</span>, the verse opens confessedly by offering us <span class="cmt_word">sons of Jehoiakim</span>, and these two, Jeconiah and Zedekiah, will fulfil the promise of that plural; and again, the seventeenth verse enters upon the formal enumeration of <span class="accented">sons to</span> Jeconiah. The question, therefore, returns - Who was this Zedekiah, <span class="accented">son</span> of Jehoiakim? Some consider him identical with the Zedekiah of the previous verse, and that "his son" means here "his successor." This undoes fewer difficulties than it makes. If the text be not corrupt, the likeliest solution is to suppose that this Zedekiah of ver. 16 is an otherwise unknown brother of Jeconiah, and son of Jehoiakim. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>3:1-24 Genealogies. - Of all the families of Israel, none were so illustrious as the family of David: here we have a full account of it.
