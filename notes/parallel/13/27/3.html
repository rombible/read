The "captains of the host" (Heb., <span class= "ital">hosts</span>) seem to be the twelve generals of division. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm" title="The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:5</a>.) Jashobeam, as the first of David's heroes, may have enjoyed a kind of precedence among the commanders of the army corps; although he was not commander-in-chief of the entire national forces, which was the function of Joab. Or perhaps it is meant merely to emphasise the fact that Jashobeam was "the first" in the rotation of the generals; so that the phrase "for the first month" explains what precedes it. Or "the captains of the hosts" may possibly mean the officers of the subdivisions of the first army corps, of whom Jashobeam was, of course, the chief. The context appears to favour this last explanation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - This verse tells us that Jasho-beam belonged to the tribe of Judah, through <span class="cmt_word">Perez</span>, the fourth son of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-4.htm">1 Chronicles 2:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-15 In the kingdoms of this world readiness for war forms a security for peace; in like manner, nothing so much encourages Satan's assaults as to be unwatchful.
