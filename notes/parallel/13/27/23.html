The heading of the chapter professes that the "sons of Israel, <span class= "ital">according to their number</span>," is the subject in hand. This appended note limits that statement to those who were above "twenty years old," that is, to those who were of the military age. The reference is undoubtedly to the census, of which 1 Chronicles 21 gave the account; and it is evident that one of the main objects of that census was the military and political organisation here so scantily and obscurely described.<p><span class= "bld">Because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens.</span>--The reason why David restricted the census to those who were capable of bearing arms (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>). The idea implied seems to be that to attempt to number Israel would be to evince a distrust of Jehovah's faithfulness; and, perhaps, that such an attempt could not possibly succeed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - The contents of this and the following verse may be supposed to be suggested by the distinct reference to the matter of number in the first verse of the chapter, and in the latter halves of the following fourteen verses, contrasting with the utter absence of any allusion to the same matter, when the whole body of the <span class="accented">tribes and their princes</span> are the subject, in vers. 16-22. The deeper significance of the latter part of this verse probably comes to this; that God had already given his people the proudest name for their numbers, in saying that they should be <span class="accented">numberless</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>like to the stars of the heavens</span>, and perpetually on the increase. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:16-34 The officers of the court, or the rulers of the king's substance, had the oversight and charge of the king's tillage, his vineyards, his herds, his flocks, which formed the wealth of eastern kings. Much of the wisdom of princes is seen in the choice of their ministry, and common persons show it in the choice of their advisers. David, though he had all these about him, preferred the word of God before them all. Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors.</body></html>
