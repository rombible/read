The <span class="accented">tau</span> in this word is probably an error for the article. Kennicott ('Dies.,' 72, 82) confirms this supposition by noting that the Book of Samuel constantly replaces by the definite article what appears in Chronicles as "son of." He has also shown reason for believing that the words in this passage, "that sat in the seat, are a corruption of the Hebrew text for characters that would spell our name "Jashobeam." We know nothing of this name "Hachmon," which may be the name of an earlier forefather, while <span class="cmt_word">Zabdiel</span>, thence named "the Hach-monite," appears to Be the name of the actual father of Jashobeam. Jashobeam was of Judah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-15 In the kingdoms of this world readiness for war forms a security for peace; in like manner, nothing so much encourages Satan's assaults as to be unwatchful.
