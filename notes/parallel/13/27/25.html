The classification, however, is interesting, and may be naturally expected to be tolerably complete. We do not find any distinction made between such property as might have belonged to David as private property, and such as belonged to him as king - probably because there was none worth making. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">storehouses</span>, read, as in former clause, <span class="accented">treasures.</span> The suggestion of the second half of this verse in comparison with the first is that <span class="cmt_word">Azmaveth's</span> charge was over treasures in Jerusalem. For the castles, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-4.htm">2 Chronicles 27:4</a>.

(See for some illustration of this verse also, Sallust., 'De Belle Jugurth.,' 12.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:16-34 The officers of the court, or the rulers of the king's substance, had the oversight and charge of the king's tillage, his vineyards, his herds, his flocks, which formed the wealth of eastern kings. Much of the wisdom of princes is seen in the choice of their ministry, and common persons show it in the choice of their advisers. David, though he had all these about him, preferred the word of God before them all. Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors.</body></html>
