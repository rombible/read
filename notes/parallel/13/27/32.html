Obviously this account is independent of those.<p>(33) <span class= "bld">And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">a counsellor of the king's</span>--Ahithophel, the faithless adviser, who committed suicide when his treachery proved unsuccessful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-31.htm" title="And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.">2Samuel 15:31</a> <span class= "ital">seq.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-23.htm" title="And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.">2Samuel 17:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Hushai the Archite.</span>--The faithful counsellor, who baffled the wisdom of Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17).<p>(34) <span class= "bld">And after Ahithophel</span>--After his death, Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar, the Ithamarite high priest, were David's advisers. Benaiah's father was named Jehoiada (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm" title="The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm" title="Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lion like men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.">1Chronicles 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.">1Chronicles 18:17</a>), so that David's counsellor Jehoiada bore the name of his grandfather--a common enough occurrence. Others assume that the right reading is "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada," who may have been an adviser of David, as well as captain of his guard.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32-34.</span> - These verses contain the names of seven men of high position, and who were, at all events, important enough, in one respect or another, for this closing special mention. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan and Ahithophel</span> are singled out as counsellors (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span>) of the king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Hushai the Archite</span> is mentioned as the <span class="cmt_word">companion</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span>) of the king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar</span> are mentioned as standing in a similar relation of counsellors to the king with Ahithophel, but after him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The great general of the whole army of the king (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5be;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">Joab</span>, has a place found for his name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> And the name of <span class="accented">Jehiel</span> is mentioned as <span class="cmt_word">of one with the king's sons</span>. The <span class="accented">first</span> thing which may be observed as to this enumeration is that it is not one whole belonging to the later portion of David's time. Ahithophel had brag before put an end to his own life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-21.htm">2 Samuel 17:21-23</a>; also see 2 Samuel 15:12, 31, 34; 16:20-23). <span class="accented">Secondly</span>, that out of the seven names, four or five are already well known to us in some other capacity; for see the lists of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-14.htm">1 Chronicles 18:14-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23-26</a>. And <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, that in one or two instances, a different or additional part is assigned to the names mentioned. The impression left with us is rather of honourable or special mention made of seven who had been distinguished helpers of the king or the kingdom at one time or another. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - Nothing is known of any <span class="cmt_word">uncle</span> to David, named <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan</span>, but special mention is made, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-7.htm">1 Chronicles 20:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-21.htm">2 Samuel 21:21</a>, of a nephew, son of Shimea, who rendered valuable service, and u-hose name was Jonathan. It is possible that the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> may mean "nephew," as simply meaning "relative." It must be admitted, however, as very remarkable, that in Leviticus, Numbers, the historical books, Jeremiah, and Amos, to the number of sixteen times in all, the word confessedly means "uncle;" while this seventeenth time, it would appear to mean "nephew." On the other hand, in Proverbs, Canticles, Isaiah, Ezekiel, to the number of thirty-six times in all, the word follows its other branch of signification of "love," and in particular "one beloved." Nothing certain can be said of the <span class="cmt_word">Jehiel</span> of this verse, but, if a son of <span class="cmt_word">Hachmoni</span>, we may presume him to have been related to Jashobeam of ver. 2 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:16-34 The officers of the court, or the rulers of the king's substance, had the oversight and charge of the king's tillage, his vineyards, his herds, his flocks, which formed the wealth of eastern kings. Much of the wisdom of princes is seen in the choice of their ministry, and common persons show it in the choice of their advisers. David, though he had all these about him, preferred the word of God before them all. Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors.</body></html>
