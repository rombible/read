Joab omitted to number Levi and Benjamin.<p><span class= "bld">Because there fell wrath for it.</span>--The same phrase recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-10.htm" title="And what cause soever shall come to you of your brothers that dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, you shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come on you, and on your brothers: this do, and you shall not trespass.">2Chronicles 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-18.htm" title="And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.">2Chronicles 24:18</a>.

The number which Joab ascertained was not recorded, as might have been expected, in the official annals of the reign, here designated as "the account of the chronicles of king David" (<span class= "ital">mispar dibre ha-y?mim</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It is implied that the chronicler had these annals before him in some form or other, probably as a section of the "History of the Kings of Judah and Israel," and that he found the lists of this chapter in that source. Those of 1 Chronicles 23-26 may have been derived from the same authority. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm" title="And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goes down to Silla.">2Kings 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-8.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2Kings 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-12.htm" title="And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2Kings 13:12</a>, and all similar instances, the phrase for "book of the Chronicles" is not <span class= "ital">mispar,</span> but <span class= "ital">s?pher dibre ha-y?mim.</span> Some suppose that the text here should be altered accordingly; others would render <span class= "ital">mispar dibre ha-y?mim,</span> "the statistical section of the annals." But <span class= "ital">mispar</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-15.htm" title="And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD has delivered into your hand the host of Midian.">Judges 7:15</a> means <span class= "ital">the telling</span> or <span class= "ital">relation of</span> a dream, and the transition from such a sense to that of written relation is easy. The phrase rendered "Chronicles" is the same as the Hebrew title of these books.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - It seems a little surprising to read of Joab, fixed on the page of history as the person <span class="cmt_word">who began to number, but</span>... finished not, when we have been already particularly told that it was <span class="accented">he</span> to whom King David's command to number was "abominable" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-6.htm">1 Chronicles 21:6</a>). However differently enough from the method of either nature or mankind, the antidote has here preceded the evil. For <span class="cmt_word">because there fell wrath for it</span>, read the Hebrew, <span class="accented">and there was for this wrath upon Israel.</span> The last sentence of the verse purports to say that such numbering as had been done before the point at which Joab stopped was not honoured by a place, where other numbers were found, in the register of the chronicles of King David. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:16-34 The officers of the court, or the rulers of the king's substance, had the oversight and charge of the king's tillage, his vineyards, his herds, his flocks, which formed the wealth of eastern kings. Much of the wisdom of princes is seen in the choice of their ministry, and common persons show it in the choice of their advisers. David, though he had all these about him, preferred the word of God before them all. Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors.</body></html>
