Yet there can scarcely he any doubt of the meaning of the verse, viz. that the writer would speak of <span class="cmt_word">the children of Israel, including the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, as regards their courses and their number in their courses, as they succeeded one another, month by month, including also all those officers who served the king in any relation to these courses - the courses were twelve, and each course was numbered twenty-four thousand.</span> Meantime, when we turn to the list, we do not find any full complement of <span class="accented">chiefs</span>, <span class="accented">captains</span>, and <span class="accented">officers</span> specified, but apparently only the <span class="accented">chief</span> of each course, with somewhat ambiguous additions in vers. 4 (Mikloth), 6 (Ammizabad), 7 (Zebadiah); while what seems an unnecessary stress repeats the <span class="accented">number</span> each time. This, however, in fact, tallies with the clause "respecting their number" in the first verse, and may constitute the explanation of the apparent inconsistency in question. Milman ('Hist. of the Jews,' 1:251, edit. 1830) says on this military portion of David's preparations, that he "organized an immense disposable force; every month twenty-four thousand men, furnished in rotation by the tribes, appeared in arms, and were trained as the standing militia of the country. At the head of his army were officers of consummate experience and, what was more highly esteemed in the warfare of the time, extraordinary personal activity, strength, and valour. His heroes remind us of those of Arthuror Charlemagne, excepting that the <span class="accented">armour</span> of the feudal chieftains constituted their superiority; here, main strength of body and dauntless fortitude of mind." <span class="cmt_word">Which came in and went out month by month</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> exchanged places in rotation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5-7, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>27:1-15 In the kingdoms of this world readiness for war forms a security for peace; in like manner, nothing so much encourages Satan's assaults as to be unwatchful.
