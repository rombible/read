It is now brought into prominence that the ark and the tabernacle are in two separate places. The great ordinary sacrifices and services, "all that is written in the Law of the Lord," are carefully observed on the original altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-2.htm">Exodus 38:2</a>) in the tabernacle. Other and special sacrifices evidently were offered in the presence of the ark. The tabernacle erected in the wilderness was first stationed at Shiloh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3, 4</a>). The occasion of its removal to Nob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>) is not narrated. The present passage first tells us where it had been since the slaughter of the priests at Saul's command by Doeg the Edomite. Some distinct statement, like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-29.htm">1 Chronicles 21:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, might have been expected here<span class="cmt_word">. Zadok the priest</span> is given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-9</a>) as in the line of Eleazar. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:37-43 The worship of God ought to be the work of every day. David put it into order. At Jerusalem, where the ark was, Asaph and his brethren were to minister before the ark continually, with songs of praise. No sacrifices were offered there, nor incense burnt, because the altars were not there; but David's prayers were directed as incense, and the lifting up of his hands as the evening sacrifice. So early did spiritual worship take place of ceremonial. Yet the ceremonial worship, being of Divine institution, must by no means be omitted; therefore at Gibeon, at the altars, the priests attended; for their work was to sacrifice and burn incense; and that they did continually, morning and evening, according to the law of Moses. As the ceremonies were types of the mediation of Christ, the observance of them was of great consequence. The attendance of his appointed ministers is right in itself, and encourages the people.</body></html>
