(See Psalms 106; Psalms 107, 118, 136.; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm" title="The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 33:11</a>.) The ode thus concludes with the thought from which it started (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-8.htm" title="Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the people.">1Chronicles 16:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-36.</span> - These verses, from the first, forty-seventh, and forty-eighth of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a>, must have suggested the sad intermediate contents of that psalm, the significant key-note of which is sounded in our thirty-fifth verse. The suggestion in the midst of the unbounded gladness of this day is affecting, and must have been intended for salutary lesson and timely warning. In the midst of the fulness of praise and joy, the people are led to prayer - say ye - and the prayer is an humble petition for salvation, union, and protection from every enemy. God's treatment of his anointed people had been on his part one continued protection and one prolonged salvation. Yet they had often neither prayed for these nor acknowledged them. Now they are led again by the hand, as it were, to the footstool of the throne. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:7-36 Let God be glorified in our praises. Let others be edified and taught, that strangers to him may be led to adore him. Let us ourselves triumph and trust in God. Those that give glory to God's name are allowed to glory in it. Let the everlasting covenant be the great matter of our joy his people of old, be remembered by us with thankfulness to him. Show forth from day to day his salvation, his promised salvation by Christ. We have reason to celebrate that from day to day; for we daily receive the benefit, and it is a subject that can never be exhausted. In the midst of praises, we must not forget to pray for the servants of God in distress.</body></html>
