Nothing is here said of similar duties of the priests before the Ark on Zion. But it ought not to be argued from this omission that in the chronicler's opinion only choral services took place there. If, as we have supposed, Abiathar was attached to David's sacred tent, sacrifice must have been offered there as well as at Gibeon. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-16.htm" title="And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;">1Chronicles 18:16</a>. ) The present account says nothing of this, because the writer is mainly interested in the service of song. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-1.htm" title="Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.">1Kings 8:1-4</a>.)<p>(41) The narrative returns to its principal topic--the Levitical minstrels.<p><span class= "bld">And with them</span> (Zadok and his brethren) <span class= "bld">Heman and Jeduthun.</span>--These two masters of song ministered in the tabernacle at Gibeon, as their colleague Asaph did in the tent on Zion.<p><span class= "bld">Who were expressed</span> (enrolled) <span class= "bld">by name.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-31.htm" title="And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.">1Chronicles 12:31</a>.

Omitting as spurious the names of the two leaders, who are not likely to have had the custody of the various instruments of their choirs, the meaning of the verse is simply that the Levitical minstrels were provided with proper instruments to accompany their singing.<p><span class= "bld">Musical instruments of God.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">instruments of song of God</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of sacred music.

Obed-edom, son of Jeduthun, was a warder before the Ark. Thus the warders of both sanctuaries belonged to the same clan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37-43.</span> - These verses give the now new-ordained distribution of priests and Levites, to minister and to attend to the service of praise before the ark. And the first of them may be considered to mark an important step in advance in the crystallizing of the world's ecclesiastical institutions. Asaph and his brethren of song are <span class="cmt_word">left there before the ark of the covenant... to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required</span>. A permanent local ministry and choir are thus established, with a fixity of place on Zion, and regularity of time that had been hitherto unattainable. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:37-43 The worship of God ought to be the work of every day. David put it into order. At Jerusalem, where the ark was, Asaph and his brethren were to minister before the ark continually, with songs of praise. No sacrifices were offered there, nor incense burnt, because the altars were not there; but David's prayers were directed as incense, and the lifting up of his hands as the evening sacrifice. So early did spiritual worship take place of ceremonial. Yet the ceremonial worship, being of Divine institution, must by no means be omitted; therefore at Gibeon, at the altars, the priests attended; for their work was to sacrifice and burn incense; and that they did continually, morning and evening, according to the law of Moses. As the ceremonies were types of the mediation of Christ, the observance of them was of great consequence. The attendance of his appointed ministers is right in itself, and encourages the people.</body></html>
