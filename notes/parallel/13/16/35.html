The compiler or interpolator has added it here in order to connect <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-34.htm" title="O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.">1Chronicles 16:34</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-1.htm" title="Praise you the LORD. O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 106:1</a>) with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-35.htm" title="And say you, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.">1Chronicles 16:35</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-47.htm" title="Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks to your holy name, and to triumph in your praise.">Psalm 106:47</a>). It was doubtless suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-10.htm" title="Say among the heathen that the LORD reigns: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.">Psalm 96:10</a> : "Say ye among the nations, The Lord reigneth."<p><span class= "bld">O God of our salvation.</span>--The psalm has "Jehovah our God."<p><span class= "bld">Gather</span> <span class= "bld">us.</span>--The phrase used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm" title="Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:">Jeremiah 32:37</a>, and many other places, of Israel's restoration from exile.<p><span class= "bld">And deliver us.</span>--Not in the psalm, where the words "gather us from among the heathen" certainly refer to the dispersion. This reference is eliminated by the compiler's insertion.<p><span class= "bld">Glory in thy praise.</span>--<span class= "bld">"</span>Glory" (<span class= "ital">hishtabb?ah</span>) is a common Aramaic word, found only here (and in Psalms 106) in the Old Testament.<p>(36) <span class= "bld">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.</span>--The <span class= "ital">B?r?ch?h</span> or benedictory close of the fourth book of the Psalter. This doxology did not form part of the original psalm, which closed with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-35.htm" title="And say you, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.">1Chronicles 16:35</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-47.htm" title="Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks to your holy name, and to triumph in your praise.">Psalm 106:47</a>). After the psalms had been edited in their present arrangement of five books, each concluding with a doxology, these doxologies came in time to be sung in liturgical service as integral parts of the psalms to which they were appended.<p><span class= "bld">And all the people said, Amen.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-48.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise you the LORD.">Psalm 106:48</a> has, "And let all the people say, Amen. Hallelujah." The chronicler, or rather the interpolator of his work has altered a liturgical direction, or rubric, into a historical statement suitable to the occasion to which his long ode is assigned. Instances of a like free handling of fixed formulas may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm" title="It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;">2Chronicles 5:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-11.htm" title="And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endures for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.">Ezra 3:11</a>.<p>Those who hold the chronicler himself responsible for this thanksgiving ode, find in it a weighty indication of the fact that the Psalter already existed in its present shape at his epoch. The historian might, of course, have inserted such a composition in his work, as fairly and freely as such writers as Thucydides and Livy have put ideal speeches into the mouths of their leading-characters; but, for reasons already stated, we do not think that the ode should be ascribed to his pen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:7-36 Let God be glorified in our praises. Let others be edified and taught, that strangers to him may be led to adore him. Let us ourselves triumph and trust in God. Those that give glory to God's name are allowed to glory in it. Let the everlasting covenant be the great matter of our joy his people of old, be remembered by us with thankfulness to him. Show forth from day to day his salvation, his promised salvation by Christ. We have reason to celebrate that from day to day; for we daily receive the benefit, and it is a subject that can never be exhausted. In the midst of praises, we must not forget to pray for the servants of God in distress.</body></html>
