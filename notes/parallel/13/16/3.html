The royal giver, who now <span class="cmt_word">dealt to every one of Israel</span>, was, after all, but a channel; yes, and only one channel, through which the fulness and the bounty of the royal Giver of every good and perfect gift, of all good whatsoever, of all things necessary to life and godliness, are supplied to every one of his creature-subjects. But it is highest honour, as servant and instrument alone, to figure forth him in any way. The second little clause tells us either that <span class="cmt_word">women</span> took a recognized place on occasion of this joyous festival, or that the hospitality of such an occasion did not forget them and their homes. And the following three little clauses require closer examination. The word here translated "loaf" in the expression <span class="cmt_word">loaf of bread</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, for which in this sense we may turn to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-26.htm">Proverbs 6:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>. The corresponding word, however, in the parallel place is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (for which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-15.htm">Numbers 6:15, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-20.htm">Numbers 15:20</a>). The essential meaning of the former word is a <span class="accented">circle</span>, hence applied to the cake because of its shape, and of the latter word <span class="accented">perforation</span>, hence applied to the cake because it was perforated. <span class="cmt_word">A good piece of flesh</span>. This is the Authorized Version rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, which occurs only in the parallel place and here. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">assatura bubulae carnis</span>; the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>. The imagined derivation of the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (ox) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (fire), or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (to burn), seems to be what has led to these translations, helped, perhaps, by the apparent convenience of adapting <span class="accented">meat</span> from the sacrifice to the <span class="accented">bread.</span> But Gesenius, Rodiger, Keil, and others prefer the derivation <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (to measure), and they would render "a measure" of wine. <span class="cmt_word">And a flagon</span>. This is the Authorized Version rendering of the original <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, found in the parallel place as well as here, and also in the only other places (two in number, and in the plural) where it occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-5.htm">Song of Solomon 2:5</a>; Hoses 3:1). But there is no doubt, or but little, that the rendering should rather be "dried, pressed cakes of raisins or grapes." It is then to be derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (to press). The substantive has both masculine and feminine form in plural. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">similam frixam oleo</span>, which means a "baked cake of flour and oil;" and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the parallel places. But here the Septuagint reads <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;</span> the whole account of the loaf, the good piece of flesh, and the flagon. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-6 Though God's word and ordinances may be clouded and eclipsed for a time, they shall shine out of obscurity. This was but a tent, a humble dwelling, yet this was the tabernacle which David, in his psalms, often speaks of with so much affection. David showed himself generous to his subjects, as he had found God gracious to him. Those whose hearts are enlarged with holy joy, should show it by being open-handed.</body></html>
