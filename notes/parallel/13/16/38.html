Explanation is needed of the <span class="accented">plural</span> pronoun "their." Either another name is wanted with Obed-edom, or tacit reference is made to "Asaph and his brethren," as though the name Asaph had not been followed in its own place by the clause "and his brethren." Keil draws attention to the "three score and two" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-8.htm">1 Chronicles 26:8</a>, in connection with the <span class="cmt_word">three score and eight</span> of this place; and it has been proposed to make up this number by some of the sons of <span class="cmt_word">Hosah</span>, of our following verse and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-11.htm">1 Chronicles 26:11</a>. In this case the name Hesah might be the name missing before, "and their brethren." Conjecture, however, has not sufficient clue here to warrant it, and the textual state of this verse must be debited with the obscurity. The ambiguity respecting the name Obed-edom has already (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>) been alluded to. Neglecting this ambiguity, it may be repeated that <span class="cmt_word">Obed-edom,... son of Jedithun</span> (as the Keri of this passage is) was a Merarite Levite, while Obed-edom son of Jeduthun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">1 Chronicles 15:25</a>) was of Gath-rimmon, a Gittite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-10.htm">2 Samuel 6:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>), a Kohathite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-66.htm">1 Chronicles 6:66, 69</a>), and a Korhite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-5</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:37-43 The worship of God ought to be the work of every day. David put it into order. At Jerusalem, where the ark was, Asaph and his brethren were to minister before the ark continually, with songs of praise. No sacrifices were offered there, nor incense burnt, because the altars were not there; but David's prayers were directed as incense, and the lifting up of his hands as the evening sacrifice. So early did spiritual worship take place of ceremonial. Yet the ceremonial worship, being of Divine institution, must by no means be omitted; therefore at Gibeon, at the altars, the priests attended; for their work was to sacrifice and burn incense; and that they did continually, morning and evening, according to the law of Moses. As the ceremonies were types of the mediation of Christ, the observance of them was of great consequence. The attendance of his appointed ministers is right in itself, and encourages the people.</body></html>
