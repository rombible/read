This psalm, in the Psalter, consists of five strophes or stanzas of six lines each--an artistic arrangement which has been violated here. The subject is the extension of Jehovah's kingdom over all the world, a thought familiar to the readers of the Book of Isaiah, where most of the ideas and phrases of the psalm may be found.<p>(23) <span class= "bld">Sing unto the Lord, all the earth.</span>--The second line of the psalm. The spirited opening of the psalm is purposely weakened, by omission of the first and third lines, in order to make it fit in here. Strophe I. is thus compressed into four lines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/16-23.htm" title="Sing to the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation.">1Chronicles 16:23-24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">All the earth.</span>--<span class= "ital">All the land</span> (of Israel).<p><span class= "bld">Shew forth.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">tell the</span> (good) <span class= "ital">news of.</span><p><span class= "bld">His salvation.</span>--<span class= "ital">Deliverance</span> (from exile).<p>(24) <span class= "bld">Heathen.</span>--<span class= "ital">Nations</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-31.htm" title="Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigns.">1Chronicles 16:31</a>).<p>(25-27) Strophe II. of the psalm. Jehovah is the Creator; other gods are nonentities.<p>(25) <span class= "bld">He also.</span>--<span class= "ital">And he.</span> The conjunction is not in Psalms 96, and is a prosaic addition of the compiler. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-20.htm" title="And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;">1Chronicles 16:20</a>.)<p>(26) <span class= "bld">People.</span>--<span class= "ital">Peoples.</span><p><span class= "bld">Idols </span>(<span class= "ital">'?lilim</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--A favourite expression in Isaiah.<p>(27) <span class= "bld">Strength and gladness are in his place.</span>--<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-6.htm" title="Honor and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.">Psalm 96:6</a> : "Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary." The psalmist's idea of the heavenly temple seems to have been understood of the earthly; and then his phrase was altered as unsuitable.<p><span class= "bld">Gladness</span> (<span class= "ital">hedw?h</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--A late word, occurring again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm" title="Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy to our LORD: neither be you sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.">Nehemiah 8:10</a> only. "Beauty" (<span class= "ital">tiph'ereth</span>) is ancient.<p><span class= "bld">His place</span>--i.e., the tent of the Ark on Mount Zion.

A call to all nations to come and worship in the Temple of Jehovah.<p>(28) <span class= "bld">Kindreds of the people.</span>--Clans (races) <span class= "ital">of the peoples.</span><p>(29) So far each verse of this ode has symmetrically consisted of two clauses.

That line--"Say ye among the nations, Jehovah is king"--begins the fourth strophe of the original hymn, but is here strangely transferred to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-31.htm" title="Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigns.">1Chronicles 16:31</a>.<p>(31) <span class= "bld">Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice.</span>--In the Hebrew, the initial letters of these words form an acrostic of the sacred Name of Jehovah; and those of the first half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-32.htm" title="Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.">1Chronicles 16:32</a> make up <span class= "ital">Iahu,</span> another form of the Name.<p><span class= "bld">And let men say.</span>--An adaptation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-10.htm" title="Say among the heathen that the LORD reigns: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.">Psalm 96:10</a> : "<span class= "ital">Say ye</span> among the nations."<p>(32) <span class= "bld">Let the fields rejoice.</span>--Here begins the fifth strophe of the original psalm.<p><span class= "bld">Fields.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the</span> <span class= "ital">field,</span> or <span class= "ital">open country.</span> Psalms 96 has an archaic spelling of the word (<span class= "ital">s?dai</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> which is here modernised (<span class= "ital">s?deh</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Rejoice.</span>--<span class= "ital">Exult</span> (not the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-31.htm" title="Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigns.">1Chronicles 16:31</a>).<p>(33) <span class= "bld">At the presence of.</span>--The compound preposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-30.htm" title="Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.">1Chronicles 16:30</a>. The climax of the psalm--"He shall judge the world in righteousness, and peoples in his faithfulness"--is here omitted; and this long and heterogeneous composition terminates with verses borrowed from a third source.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-36.</span> - The grandeur and unusual comprehensiveness of the adoration and homage here proclaimed, as to be offered to the omnipotent Ruler of all nations, should be well pondered.

Let the everlasting covenant be the great matter of our joy his people of old, be remembered by us with thankfulness to him. Show forth from day to day his salvation, his promised salvation by Christ. We have reason to celebrate that from day to day; for we daily receive the benefit, and it is a subject that can never be exhausted. In the midst of praises, we must not forget to pray for the servants of God in distress.</body></html>
