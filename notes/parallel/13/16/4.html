Compared, then, with the older text, this relation of the chronicler's looks like a parenthesis interpolated from another source into the history, as narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/6-12.htm" title="And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.">2Samuel 6:12-20</a>.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">And he appointed certain of the Levites.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">put, placed</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-12.htm" title="And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.">Genesis 3:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To minister.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">ministering</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., as ministers.</span> The object of the appointment is defined by the words which follow: "both to remind, and to thank, and to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel." Each verb expresses a distinct kind of duty in the service of song.<p><span class= "bld">To record</span> is the technical term for chanting the psalms which accompanied the sacrificial burning of the <span class= "ital">Azk?r?h,</span> that is, the part of the meat offering that was presented on the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-2.htm" title="And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of there his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD:">Leviticus 2:2</a>). (Comp. the use of the cognate verb in the titles of Psalms 38, 70)<p><span class= "bld">To thank</span> was to perform psalms of invocation, and confession of benefits received.<p><span class= "bld">To praise</span> was to sing and play hymns of hallelujah such as Psalms 146-150.<p>These Levites were to minister thus before the Ark in the sacred tent of Mount Zion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span> - These verses contain a statement of the arrangement David made of a more permanent nature, but to date from this commencement, for the service of thanksgiving by the Levites. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To minister</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> officiate, as we should say, in the service before the ark. The verse seems to describe what should be the essence of that service. It was threefold - <span class="cmt_word">to record, to thank</span>, and to praise the Lord God of Israel. The word here used for "record" is the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (to remember), and is remarked upon by Gesenius as a title strictly appropriate to the character of the two psalms Psalms 38 and Psalms 70, on the head of which it stands, as meaning, "to make others remember" (see also such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-26.htm">Isaiah 43:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>). The minds of the people were to be refreshed in this service and in their very psalm of praise (so note in this sense vers. 8, 9, 12, 21, etc.), by being reminded or told, so far as the youngest of them might be concerned, of God's marvellous and merciful deeds for their forefathers of many, many a generation. Then they were to give intelligent and hearty thanks. And, lastly, they were to offer to approach that purest form of worship which consists in adoring praise. One might imagine with what zest they would have accepted, with what fervour they would have added lip and instrument of music to it - that one verse which needed the revolution yet of nearly another three thousand years, that it might flow from the devotion or' Addison. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When all thy mercies, O my God,<br />My rising soul surveys,<br />Transported with the view I'm lost<br />In wonder, love, and praise."</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-6 Though God's word and ordinances may be clouded and eclipsed for a time, they shall shine out of obscurity. This was but a tent, a humble dwelling, yet this was the tabernacle which David, in his psalms, often speaks of with so much affection. David showed himself generous to his subjects, as he had found God gracious to him. Those whose hearts are enlarged with holy joy, should show it by being open-handed.</body></html>
