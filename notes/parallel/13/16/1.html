On the other hand, there is no mention of any such tent having been got in readiness in ch. 13. or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-11</a>, which give the account of the attempt that disastrously failed. The expressions which are there used would rather lead to the conclusion that David's intention was to take the sacred structure into his own home (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-9.htm">2 Samuel 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-12.htm">1 Chronicles 13:12, 13</a>), for a while, at all events. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (tent) of the original designates, when Intended strictly, a haircloth covering, resting on poles or planks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-7.htm">Exodus 26:7, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-14.htm">Exodus 36:14, 19</a>). The first occasion of the use of the word is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-20.htm">Genesis 4:20</a>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> (booth) was made of leaves and branches interwoven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34, 40, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (tabernacle) was the dwelling-place or pavilion, which owned to the ten inner curtains as well as the outer covering and the framework (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1, 12-15</a>, etc.; Exodus 39:32; 40:2, 29). The first occurrence of this word is in the first of these last-quoted references. <span class="cmt_word">Burnt sacrifices and peace offerings</span>. The identical words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17, 18</a>, where the Authorized Version translates "burnt offerings and peace offerings." These were the two great sacrifices - the former speaking of atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>, etc.), the latter of <span class="accented">reconciliation effected</span> and the enjoyment of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-5</a>, etc.). Neither here nor in the parallel place is any mention made of the altar upon which these sacrifices were offered. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>16:1-6 Though God's word and ordinances may be clouded and eclipsed for a time, they shall shine out of obscurity. This was but a tent, a humble dwelling, yet this was the tabernacle which David, in his psalms, often speaks of with so much affection. David showed himself generous to his subjects, as he had found God gracious to him. Those whose hearts are enlarged with holy joy, should show it by being open-handed.</body></html>
