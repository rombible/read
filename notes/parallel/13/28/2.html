He had not lost the man and the brother in his official and exalted rank, and, following ancient precedents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-4.htm">Genesis 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-23.htm">Judges 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a>), he addresses the congregation as <span class="cmt_word">my brethren, and my people</span>.

God is often spoken of as "dwelling between the cherubim," and sometimes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>) as "<span class="accented">sitting</span> between the cherubim," which were over the <span class="accented">lid</span> of the ark, called the mercy-seat. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 During David's last sickness, many chief priests and Levites were at Jerusalem. Finding himself able, David spoke of his purpose to build a temple for God, and of God's disallowing that purpose. He opened to them God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon. David charged them to cleave stedfastly to God and their duty. We cannot do our work as we should, unless we put on resolution, and fetch in strength from Divine grace. Religion or piety has two distinct parts. The first is knowledge of God, the second is worship of God. David says, Know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. God is made known by his works and word. Revelation alone shows the whole character of God, in his providence, his holy law, his condemnation of sinners, his blessed gospel, and the ministration of the Spirit to all true believers. The natural man cannot receive this knowledge of God. But thus we learn the value of the Saviour's atonement, and of the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and are influenced to walk in all his commandments. It brings a sinner to his proper place at the foot of the cross, as a poor, guilty, helpless worm, deserving wrath, yet expecting every thing needful from the free mercy and grace of God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Having been forgiven much, the pardoned sinner learns to love much.</body></html>
