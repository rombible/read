The omission of any introductory formula, such as "And David said," is dramatic. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-8.htm" title="Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the people.">1Chronicles 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:">1Chronicles 23:4-5</a>.) Literally rendered, after the Hebrew punctuation, the verse runs:--"The whole in a writing from the hand of Jehovah, to me he made clear; all the works of the model." With the expression "a writing from the hand of Jehovah" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>), David affirms his "pattern" of the sanctuary and its vessels to have been conceived, and described in writing, under that Divine guidance which he sought and followed in all the great enterprises of his life. Whether "the writing" was a communication "by the hand of" one of David's seers, or merely the description of the Mosaic sanctuary (Exodus 25 <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> is not clear. The verb "he taught" (<span class= "ital">hiskil</span>) requires an object, such as is supplied in the Authorised version: "made me understand." It takes a dative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-11.htm" title="When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.">Proverbs 21:11</a>), and probably the word rendered "upon me" is really a later equivalent of the same construction. Else we might compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-8.htm" title="And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God on me.">Nehemiah 2:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, and render: "The whole, in a writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, he taught," implying that David himself sketched out the whole design under Divine inspiration. Perhaps the text is corrupt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - This abrupt bringing in of David as the speaker himself has already had one illustration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>. (See on the matter of this verse, note on per. 11; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a> for the parallel of an expression which evidently intends to assert an <span class="accented">inspiring</span> hand of the Lord.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:11-21 The temple must be a sacred thing, and a type of Christ; it must be framed by Divine teaching. Christ is the true temple, the church is the gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framed according to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divine wisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. David gave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials were provided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions were given which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be not dismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first place. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried them through the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leave us, while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely to go on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope in God's mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.</body></html>
