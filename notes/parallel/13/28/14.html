Apparently it continues the construction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-12.htm" title="And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:">1Chronicles 28:12</a>, so that the sense is: "He gave him a pattern or description for the golden vessels (literally, <span class= "ital">for the gold</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> by the weight for the golden vessels (Heb., <span class= "ital">for the gold</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> for all vessels of each kind of service (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> <span class= "ital">use</span>); and he gave him a pattern for all the silver vessels, by weight, for all vessels of each kind of service." In other words, David gave Solomon an account or schedule of all the different vessels of gold and silver that would be required for the sanctuary, specifying the exact weight of each. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-25.htm" title="And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:">Ezra 8:25</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-34.htm" title="By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.">Ezra 8:34</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - The general meaning of these verses is that, if the question were one of gold, or one of silver, David assigned for each vessel and each part of the candlesticks, the proportionate <span class="cmt_word">weight of gold</span> that was to be employed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:11-21 The temple must be a sacred thing, and a type of Christ; it must be framed by Divine teaching. Christ is the true temple, the church is the gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framed according to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divine wisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. David gave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials were provided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions were given which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be not dismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first place. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried them through the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leave us, while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely to go on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope in God's mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.</body></html>
