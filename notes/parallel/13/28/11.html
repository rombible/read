The "treasuries" or store-rooms of the Temple were probably in the side-building of three storeys (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm" title="And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:">1Kings 6:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The upper chambers</span> (<span class= "ital">'aliyoth</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--Only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold.

They were probably over the Holy of holies, the ceiling of which was twenty cubits from the floor, whereas the roof of the whole building was thirty cubits from the ground. A space of ten cubits high by twenty wide and twenty long was thus available for the upper chambers.<p><span class= "bld">The inner parlours.</span>--The fore-court, or vestibule, and the holy place, or nave, in contrast with "the place of the mercy-seat," or <span class= "ital">chamber of the Kapporeth: i.e.,</span> the Holy of holies, the inmost shrine of the whole bolding.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-19.</span> - These hints respecting the parts of the building that was to be, and respecting the furniture of it, will come in for fuller consideration in the fuller treatment of them, found in the narration of the actual construction of the building in 2 Chronicles compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6.htm">2 Kings 6</a>, etc. It is evident that David desired to make a solemn and set business of handing over even the patterns and plans. Nor is this under any circumstances wonderful, but least of all considering their Divine origin. The Divine original of the tabernacle and all its belongings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>) was not to be a neglected precedent as regards the greater temple. It is said that "David gave" these "patterns to Solomon his son" (ver. 11), and the form in which he gave them is explained in ver. 19. There we read, "The whole in writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, he made me to understand - all the works of this pattern." Whatever we generally accept respecting the <span class="accented">writing</span> of the tables of the Law by the finger of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>), is at all events open for acceptance here. At the same time, the phraseology of our nineteenth verse is certainly not so uncompromising-as that of the references just instanced from the Books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The words of ver. 19 may be satisfied by the meaning that David was in such manner and degree "in the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>), that in the writing and the drawing of patterns his hand was entirely under the guidance of that Spirit. In either alternative, to hand over such documents and such "patterns" must have been felt by David and all present an act of which much should be made. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The <span class="cmt_word">patterns</span> of six parts of the future building are here delivered over to Solomon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="cmt_word">porch</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-7.htm">Ezekiel 40:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, where we read that the length was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred and twenty cubits; 2 Chronicles 8:12; 15:8; 29:7, 17); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> rang generally, but in this verse <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is all that appears.

The <span class="accented">treasuries</span> were chambers for receiving gifts, and storing the treasures new or old of the temple. Which of the rooms that were built against the sides of the temple were set apart as these treasure- chambers is not known. Perhaps they were the three-storied wings of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The upper chambers thereof</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fbe;</span> (for fuller treatment of these, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>). We may only with confidence say of these chambers that they were <span class="accented">upper</span> chambers, but whether over the "oracle" as Keil and Bertheau think, or over the "porch," or the higher of those, that leaned against the sides of the main building, it is impossible to determine from such data as we at present have. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The inner parlours thereof; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>.

Christ is the true temple, the church is the gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framed according to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divine wisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. David gave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials were provided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions were given which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be not dismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first place. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried them through the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leave us, while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely to go on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope in God's mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.</body></html>
