David uses of himself the very phrase which the Divine voice spoke from heaven at the baptism of the Son of David, the true King of Israel and of mankind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span> - David mentions himself as the elect of God among all the members of his father's family, and from thence is led to trace the call from the first, by the following steps: - The tribe of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-2.htm">1 Chronicles 5:2</a>); the house <span class="accented">of Jesse</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>); thirdly, of <span class="accented">himself</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>); and lastly of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-11.htm">1 Chronicles 17:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The exact time and method of David's receiving the identification of Solomon as the son to succeed him, is nowhere given. <span class="cmt_word">The throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel</span>. This expression, not found in its entirety elsewhere, is an emphatic statement here of the true theocracy, which should have ever prevailed among the people of Israel, and which is now paralleled by the kingship of the Lord in his own Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-14.htm">1 Chronicles 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>). The solemn and most distinct proviso<span class="cmt_word">, If he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day,</span> reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-12.htm">Psalm 132:12</a>. This proviso is emphatically presented again to the attention of Solomon, when the time comes for the direct appeal of God to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-61.htm">1 Kings 8:61</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 During David's last sickness, many chief priests and Levites were at Jerusalem. Finding himself able, David spoke of his purpose to build a temple for God, and of God's disallowing that purpose. He opened to them God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon. David charged them to cleave stedfastly to God and their duty. We cannot do our work as we should, unless we put on resolution, and fetch in strength from Divine grace. Religion or piety has two distinct parts. The first is knowledge of God, the second is worship of God. David says, Know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. God is made known by his works and word. Revelation alone shows the whole character of God, in his providence, his holy law, his condemnation of sinners, his blessed gospel, and the ministration of the Spirit to all true believers. The natural man cannot receive this knowledge of God. But thus we learn the value of the Saviour's atonement, and of the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and are influenced to walk in all his commandments. It brings a sinner to his proper place at the foot of the cross, as a poor, guilty, helpless worm, deserving wrath, yet expecting every thing needful from the free mercy and grace of God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Having been forgiven much, the pardoned sinner learns to love much.</body></html>
