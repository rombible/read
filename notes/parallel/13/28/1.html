The classification of the verso speaks for itself. There are the princes of Israel; <span class="accented">i.q.</span> the princes of the tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16, 22</a>). Otherwise the former of these expressions may be of an entirely generic kind, and apply to all that succeeds. There are, <span class="accented">secondly</span>, the princes of the twelve military <span class="cmt_word">companies... by course</span> of the months (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</a>). <span class="accented">Thirdly</span>, there are the <span class="cmt_word">princes of thousands and hundreds</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-12.htm">1 Samuel 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-7.htm">1 Samuel 23:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-14.htm">1 Chronicles 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1</a>). There follow, <span class="accented">fourthly</span>, the <span class="cmt_word">princes of all the substance and cattle of the king</span>, and (as seems to be added here) <span class="cmt_word">of his sons</span>. There can be no doubt that the Hebrew text does say this, and does not merely register the fact of the attendance and presence of the sons of the king, as also it does not specialize the attendance of Solomon himself, though it is certain that he was present. Otherwise it may be doubtful, considering the facts of the occasion, and comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-24.htm">1 Chronicles 29:24</a>, whether the original document is not misrepresented here. Next, <span class="accented">fifthly</span>, mention is made of the <span class="cmt_word">officers</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), the Hebrew for which word generally means "eunuch," and such use of it must have become much more familiar during and after the Captivity, and, therefore, of course, at the time of the compilation of this work; but it does not necessarily mean it. Eunuchs are never mentioned elsewhere in David's reign. There is no reason to suppose the word means "eunuch," for instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-9.htm">1 Kings 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-19.htm">Jeremiah 34:19</a>. Under any circumstances, it would seem unnecessary that such <span class="accented">officers</span> of a royal establishment as eunuchs should be under summoned that description to an assembly of this kind. <span class="accented">Sixthly</span>, the <span class="cmt_word">mighty men</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10-25</a>) were called to the assembly. And perhaps <span class="accented">a seventh</span> division may be made of <span class="cmt_word">all the valiant men</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-26.htm">1 Chronicles 11:26-40</a>), who belonged to other places, or who were at this time more especially in Jerusalem, as residents. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 During David's last sickness, many chief priests and Levites were at Jerusalem. Finding himself able, David spoke of his purpose to build a temple for God, and of God's disallowing that purpose. He opened to them God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon. David charged them to cleave stedfastly to God and their duty. We cannot do our work as we should, unless we put on resolution, and fetch in strength from Divine grace. Religion or piety has two distinct parts. The first is knowledge of God, the second is worship of God. David says, Know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. God is made known by his works and word. Revelation alone shows the whole character of God, in his providence, his holy law, his condemnation of sinners, his blessed gospel, and the ministration of the Spirit to all true believers. The natural man cannot receive this knowledge of God. But thus we learn the value of the Saviour's atonement, and of the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and are influenced to walk in all his commandments. It brings a sinner to his proper place at the foot of the cross, as a poor, guilty, helpless worm, deserving wrath, yet expecting every thing needful from the free mercy and grace of God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Having been forgiven much, the pardoned sinner learns to love much.</body></html>
