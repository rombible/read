But perhaps the bodies were burnt in this exceptional case because they had been mutilated by the enemy.<p><span class= "bld">Buried their bones.</span>--Samuel, "took and buried."

For the behaviour of the men of Jabesh, comp. 1 Samuel 11<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jabesh</span>. This is the only place where "Jabesh" is used as an abbreviation for Jabesh-gilead, of which it was the chief city. Gilead comprised the lots of Reuben and Gad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1-5, 25-32, 39-41</a>) and of half Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-21.htm">1 Chronicles 27:21</a>). Saul had on a celebrated occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-13</a>) befriended the people of Jabesh-gilead, coming to their rescue against Nahath the Ammonite, of which kindness they are now mindful, show that rarest of virtues, gratitude to a fallen monarch, and are further on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a>) commended for it by David. This verse does not tell us, as the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>) does, of the first burning of the bodies, and then of the burying of the calcined bones. The silence is very remarkable. It does name the kind of tree, the "oak" or "terebinth." The word for the tree, however, in both passages is of doubtful and perhaps only generic signification. The several Hebrew words translated in various places as "oak," all share a common root, significant of the idea of <span class="accented">strength.</span> Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 243, 244) says that the country owns still to an abundance of oaks of very fine growth in some cases, and that these are exceedingly more plentiful and altogether a stronger tree than the "terebinth." The different names, though all connected with one root, referred to are probably owing to the large variety of oaks. With the statement of the burying of the bones under a tree, and the fasting of seven days on the part of these brave and grateful men of Jabesh-gilead, the <span class="accented">parallel</span> account comes to its end. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-14 The death of Saul. - The design chiefly in view in these books of the Chronicles, appears to be to preserve the records of the house of David. Therefore the writer repeats not the history of Saul's reign, but only of his death, by which a way was made for David to the throne. And from the ruin of Saul, we may learn, 1. That the sin of sinners will certainly find them out, sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man's greatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3. Disobedience is a killing thing. Saul died for not keeping the word of the Lord. May be delivered from unbelief, impatience, and despair. By waiting on the Lord we shall obtain a kingdom that cannot be moved.</body></html>
