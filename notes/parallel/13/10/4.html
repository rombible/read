And his young man thrust him through, and he died.">Judges 9:54</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Lest these uncircumcised come.</span>--Sam. Adds "and thrust me through." An inadvertent repetition there, or omission here, is possible. Or, we might say, Saul preferred death by a friendly stroke to the thrusts of insulting foemen.<p><span class= "bld">And abuse me.</span>--The Hebrew means, strictly, "to make a toy of," "sport with." "How I have made a toy of Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-2.htm" title="And that you may tell in the ears of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have worked in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know how that I am the LORD.">Exodus 10:2</a>); and is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-19.htm" title="And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.">Jeremiah 38:19</a>) of insulting a fallen foe, as here.<p><span class= "bld">Took a sword.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the sword--i.e.,</span> his sword.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And abuse me</span>. The main idea of the Hithp. of the verb here used is to <span class="accented">satisfy the</span> thirst of lust or cruelty. Saul probably feared not the abuse of mocking only, but that of torture. In the corresponding passage this verb is preceded by the clause, <span class="cmt_word">and thrust me through. His armour-bearer would not</span>. He refused the request or bidding of Saul, no doubt mainly in respect of the fact that Saul was still "the anointed." We have a full description of both the loose arms and of the armour of the body in the case of the Philistine Goliath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4-7</a>). It is one of the world's surprising facts that the making of arms and armour, and the acquiring of skill in the using of them, should, as in fact all history attests, date from so early a period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-26.htm">Genesis 31:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>). As compared with the history and the fragmentary re. mains of classical antiquity, those of Scripture are remarkably scanty on this subject. The sword is the earliest mentioned in Scripture, carried in a <span class="accented">sheath</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-27.htm">1 Chronicles 21:27</a>); though the Hebrew word is here different from that used in Samuel. It was slung by a <span class="accented">girdle</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>), rested on <span class="accented">hips</span> or <span class="accented">thigh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-16.htm">Judges 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>), and was sometimes "two-edged" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-16.htm">Judges 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>). Then follows the spear in several varieties, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-9.htm">1 Chronicles 23:9</a>. Again as a <span class="accented">javelin</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-14.htm">Joshua 8:14-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-6.htm">1 Samuel 17:6</a>, where in the Authorized Version it is called target, or gorget). Again as a <span class="accented">lancet</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-12.htm">2 Chronicles 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-9.htm">Ezekiel 39:9</a>). In addition to these three chief varieties of spear - the spear proper, the javelin, end the lancet - there is mention of two other weapons used at all events as the dart of a light kind would be used, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-10.htm">2 Chronicles 23:10</a>, and elsewhere, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>, respectively. After sword and spear rank the bow and arrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-20.htm">Genesis 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>) And lastly, the sling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-29.htm">1 Samuel 25:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-25.htm">2 Kings 3:25</a>), and a very strong weapon of the same kind mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>. The chief articles worn as bodily armour were the breastplate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5, 38</a>); the somewhat obscure habergeon, mentioned only twice, in no connection then of battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-32.htm">Exodus 28:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-23.htm">Exodus 39:23</a>), the original name of which, <span class="accented">tacharah</span>, is found on Egyptian papyri of the nineteenth dynasty, - it seems to have been a species of doublet or corselet; the helmet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5</a>; ch. 26:14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>); greaves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-6.htm">1 Samuel 17:6</a>); two kinds of shield (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7, 41</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>); and lastly the article mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-9.htm">2 Chronicles 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>; and of which we can say nothing certainly bearing upon its nature or its use, except that it was made of gold. Armour-bearers, then, the first distinct mention of whom we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-54.htm">Judges 9:54</a>, may well have been a necessity for kings and for the great. Joab had ten (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-15.htm">2 Samuel 18:15</a>). The word is not expressed as a compound in Hebrew, but as "one carrying (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) arms." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-14 The death of Saul. - The design chiefly in view in these books of the Chronicles, appears to be to preserve the records of the house of David. Therefore the writer repeats not the history of Saul's reign, but only of his death, by which a way was made for David to the throne. And from the ruin of Saul, we may learn, 1. That the sin of sinners will certainly find them out, sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man's greatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3. Disobedience is a killing thing. Saul died for not keeping the word of the Lord. May be delivered from unbelief, impatience, and despair. By waiting on the Lord we shall obtain a kingdom that cannot be moved.</body></html>
