The LXX. adds "on that day" here, while in Samuel it omits "all his men," thus minimising the differences of text. It is mere pedantry to press the phrases "all his men," "all his house." The strength of these expressions indicates the completeness of the overthrow.<p>The chronicler was fully aware that some of Saul's house were not engaged in this battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm" title="And in Gibeon dwelled the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:">1Chronicles 9:35</a>). And in any case, the chief warriors of his household, and immediate followers, died with the king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All his house</span>. In place of these words, the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6</a>) has, "And his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together." This reading avoids the ambiguity referred to already (ver. 2). In either passage the moral is plain, that the end and ruin of Saul's family as a whole had arrived, rather than literally that the whole, including every member, of that family had perished. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/10.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>10:1-14 The death of Saul. - The design chiefly in view in these books of the Chronicles, appears to be to preserve the records of the house of David. Therefore the writer repeats not the history of Saul's reign, but only of his death, by which a way was made for David to the throne. And from the ruin of Saul, we may learn, 1. That the sin of sinners will certainly find them out, sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man's greatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3. Disobedience is a killing thing. Saul died for not keeping the word of the Lord. May be delivered from unbelief, impatience, and despair. By waiting on the Lord we shall obtain a kingdom that cannot be moved.</body></html>
