The use of this expression here seems to imply that the source upon which the chronicle is here dependent, was written in some locality east of the Jordan, perhaps at Babylon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - Were <span class="cmt_word">officers among them of Israel.</span> The simpler translation would be, <span class="accented">were for the superintending of Israel</span> (compare the verb in ver. 32). <span class="cmt_word">On this side Jordan westward</span>; literally, <span class="accented">across Jordan westward</span>, the point of view being from the Persian side.

The expression, in all <span class="cmt_word">the business of the Lord</span>, is probably no mere reminiscence of the temple or semi-sacred business (such as the gathering of the tithes, etc.), but rather the recognition of the fact that all that pertained to the right discharge of the civil duties of an Israelite's life lay within that description. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-32 The offices of the Levites. - The porters and treasurers of the temple, had occasion for strength and valour to oppose those who wrongly attempted to enter the sanctuary, and to guard the sacred treasures. Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.</body></html>
