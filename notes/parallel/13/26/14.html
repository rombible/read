A special note is made of the care taken for the house of <span class="cmt_word">Asuppim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of "gatherings" or "stores." For all that we know of this "house," we seem to be left to the verses (15, 17) of this passage, and to the expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a>), "the storehouses, or stores of the gates" (though the Authorized Version, the "thresholds" of the gates), which would have been more intelligible had it been reversed, "the gates of the stores." Presumably it was a building for keeping safe certain of the sacred property, and was situated south of the temple, and, judging from ver. 17, had two doorways. The Vulgate translates <span class="accented">seniorum concilium. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To Shuppim</span>. Nothing can be made of this word in this connection, as a proper name, though we have it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-12.htm">1 Chronicles 7:12, 15</a>) as such. It is now generally rejected, as probably due to the error of some transcriber, whose eye may have been caught again by the last two syllables of the closely preceding "Asuppim." But some would place it as the last word of the previous verse, and make it amplify the meaning of <span class="accented">Asuppim</span>, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "gatherings for stores." <span class="cmt_word">Shallecheth</span>. By derivation, this word means "sending or throwing down." Hence some call it, "the refuse gate." The situation of it is, however, defined here, as by the <span class="cmt_word">causeway of the going up</span>, and would seem to render such an interpretation less likely. According to Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), this causeway is still traceable: it runs up from the central valley of the town to the sacred site west of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a>); and Grove would identify the "gate of Shallecheth" with the present <span class="accented">Bab Silsileh.</span> The Septuagint translates <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gate of the temple-cell, which word they could get from the inverting of the order of the first two letters of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Shallecheth.</span> The Septuagint then mutts the following word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Ward against ward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. watch with watch.</span> The expression up- pears to refer to the fact that Hosah's lot threw to him the charge of a double position. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-32 The offices of the Levites. - The porters and treasurers of the temple, had occasion for strength and valour to oppose those who wrongly attempted to enter the sanctuary, and to guard the sacred treasures. Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.</body></html>
