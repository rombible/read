The statement of this verse makes it evident that the names in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/26-2.htm" title="And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,">1Chronicles 26:2-11</a> represent the courses of the porters or warders. As the twenty-four sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun represented the twenty-four courses of musicians in 1 Chronicles 25, a similar classification might naturally be expected here. Accordingly, we actually find seven sons of Meshelemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/26-2.htm" title="And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,">1Chronicles 26:2-3</a>), eight sons of Obed-edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/26-4.htm" title="Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.">1Chronicles 26:4-5</a>), and four sons of Hosah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/26-10.htm" title="Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)">1Chronicles 26:10-11</a>), which together make nineteen heads and classes. It remains to add the "sons" of Shemaiah son of Obed-edom. As the text stands, these appear to be six in number, which would give a total of twenty-five (7 + 8 + 4 + 6). But the connection of the Hebrew in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-7.htm" title="The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.">1Chronicles 26:7</a> is so unusual as to suggest at once that something is wrong: and if we assume Obed-Elzabad to represent one original composite name, like Obed-edom, we get five "sons of Shemaiah," and so a total of twenty-four classes or courses of warders. (From this verse to the end of chapter 27 the Syriac and Arabic versions fail us.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Translate, <span class="cmt_word">To these divisions of the porters, as regards the chief men, belonged the charge together with their brethren to officiate in the house of the Lord.</span> According to the present chapter, then, the <span class="accented">divisions</span> add up to ninety-three. And if at any time of the history it were the case that these ninety-three were the leaders of groups among the total of "four thousand porters," it would put exactly forty-two under each of these ninety-three, leaving but one over. This number ninety-three, meantime, does not agree with the <span class="accented">two hundred and twelve</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>. And the <span class="accented">three score and two</span> of Obed-edom in ver. 8 of the present chapter does not agree with the <span class="accented">three score and eight</span> of Obed-edom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>. At the same time, no little light may be thrown on this subject by noticing that the porters numbered in Zerubbabel's time one <span class="accented">hundred and thirty-nine</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a>); and that the number one <span class="accented">hundred and seventy-two</span> is given for them by Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a>). The conclusion may well be that the numbers varied in David's time and the other times severally;and that the date in question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>) was not the same with the date of David in our present chapter, but was a subsequent date nearer the time of the Captivity. There is, therefore, no special ground for doubting the accuracy of the numbers given in this chapter. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-32 The offices of the Levites. - The porters and treasurers of the temple, had occasion for strength and valour to oppose those who wrongly attempted to enter the sanctuary, and to guard the sacred treasures. Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.</body></html>
