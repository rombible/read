The number of chief fathers mentioned in this verse leads Keil to point out very justly that here at least the designation cannot mean anything beyond the fathers of individual families - cannot mean the heads of those groups which are composed of all the branches or relations of one house. They must have been heads of households (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), not heads of <span class="accented">fathers</span> <span class="accented">houses</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). The ambiguity is owing to the use of the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> in ver. 32, the latter of which words has so often supposed the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> to precede it, coupled to it by a hyphen. Adding the numbers of vers. 30 and 32, we find a total of Hebronite "officers and judges" amounting to four thousand four hundred. The remaining sixteen hundred to complete the" six thousand" were drawn from the Gershon, Amram, and Izhar families. Some of the Uzzielites probably helped the Hebronites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-32 The offices of the Levites. - The porters and treasurers of the temple, had occasion for strength and valour to oppose those who wrongly attempted to enter the sanctuary, and to guard the sacred treasures. Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.</body></html>
