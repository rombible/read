The meaning of the word is unknown. According to Gesenius (<span class= "ital">Thesaur.</span> p. 1123), "Parw?r" is the right spelling; and the term answers to a Persian word denoting "summer-house," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a building open to light and air. He makes "the Parbar" a cloister running round the court of the Temple, from which the cells were entered. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-28.htm" title="Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;">1Chronicles 23:28</a>.) Both spellings occur in Persian. Richardson's Persian Dictionary gives as many as fifteen variant forms of the word, besides <span class= "ital">Parwar</span> and <span class= "ital">Parbar.</span> His definition of the meaning is, "an open gallery or balcony on the top of a house, au upper room open on all sides to the air; a summer department or habitation; the roof of a house; a private door or entrance to a house."<p><span class= "bld">At</span> <span class= "bld">the causeway.</span>--That is, the highway of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.">1Chronicles 26:16</a>. These four warders, therefore, stood by the gate Shalleketh. Adding together the numbers given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/26-17.htm" title="Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.">1Chronicles 26:17-18</a>, we find that there were twenty-four warders on duty every day. The recurrence of the number is curious; but its relation to the twenty-four classes of the porters can hardly be determined. It is likely, however, that the twenty-four warders represent chiefs with their companies rather than individuals (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-12.htm" title="Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.">1Chronicles 26:12</a>). Twenty-four would be an insignificant fraction of 4,000 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-6.htm" title="And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.">1Chronicles 23:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>26:1-32 The offices of the Levites. - The porters and treasurers of the temple, had occasion for strength and valour to oppose those who wrongly attempted to enter the sanctuary, and to guard the sacred treasures. Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.</body></html>
