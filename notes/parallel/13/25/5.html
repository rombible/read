With this he connects the preceding phrase, which he renders "by God's commands." (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-15.htm" title="And they gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 29:15</a>.) But the horn does not appear elsewhere among the instruments of the Temple musicians, and the phrase "to lift up the horn" of a person is a well-known Hebrew metaphor. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm" title="The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder on them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.">1Samuel 2:10</a> : "May he give strength to his king, and lift up the horn of his anointed.") Thus it seems that the meaning is that God gave all these "sons"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> proficient disciples--to Heman in order to strengthen him for his work by providing him with a strong body of able assistants.<p><span class= "bld">And three daughters.</span>--The mention of "three daughters" is interesting, as an indication that women sustained a part in the service of song. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm" title="And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.">Judges 11:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1Samuel 18:6</a>.) The Syriac omits the whole verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - For the expression, <span class="cmt_word">the king's seer</span>, and as other instances of the office, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-9.htm">1 Chronicles 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a>, in neither of which places, however, have we the attendant phrase, <span class="cmt_word">in the words of God</span>. Yet we have the same sense strictly implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-9.htm">1 Chronicles 21:9, 19</a>. The expression needs not to be generalized into "in the matters of God," but evidently describes the seer (Heman, Gad, or Jeduthun) as the authorized medium of verbal communication between God and the king. There is difficulty in assigning the right place of the clause, <span class="cmt_word">to lift up the horn</span>. There can be no doubt at all that it contains no allusion whatever to the horn as an instrument of sound (the almost solitary approach to which use of the word is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>), but that it falls in with the very frequent <span class="accented">figurative</span> use of the phrase as it occurs in the very same words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-5.htm">Psalm 75:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1, 10</a>, etc.), and which means "to add to the strength" or "honour" of any one. The allusion is to the number of Heman's children being a mark of the honour God set on him. The words cannot go with the latter part of the verse, while the conjunction (<span class="accented">vav</span>) in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> opens it.

If the Spirit of God do not put life and fervour into our devotions, they will, however ordered, be a lifeless, worthless form.</body></html>
