The ancients regarded musical utterance as an effect and proof of direct inspiration, and we still speak of the higher results of genius as inspired, however we may choose to explain the term away as a mere figure of speech. The power of moving sounds, whether of voice or instrument, is not to be gained by mere study or training; it is commonly spoken of as a "gift," and its products are called "inspirations." Whence come they, if not from the Divine source of life, and of all that makes life glad and beautiful?

The term "work" is popularly restricted to what is called productive labour, but it is not difficult to see that persons engaged, like these minstrels, in singing and playing to the praise of God are actually helping to produce one of the best of real results, viz., the conservation of the religious spirit: that is, of the right attitude of man towards the Power upon whom his entire welfare absolutely depends.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The twenty-four courses of those who were to be engaged in the temple service as singers and musicians fill up this chapter.

Thus these singers and musicians were drawn from each great branch of Levi; viz. from Gershon, four through Asaph; from Kohath, six through Jeduthun; and from Merari, fourteen through Heman; while the whole number of those trained to sing was two hundred and eighty-eight. <span class="cmt_word">Who should prophesy</span>.

To prophesy, in this place, means praising God with great earnestness and devout affections, under the influences of the Holy Spirit. In raising these affections, poetry and music were employed. If the Spirit of God do not put life and fervour into our devotions, they will, however ordered, be a lifeless, worthless form.</body></html>
