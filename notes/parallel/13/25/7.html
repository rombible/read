These brethren (partly composed of their <span class="accented">sons</span>, as appears from vers. 9-31) were to aid in the songs of the Lord, and were apparently under instruction for that purpose. Each one of the twenty-four had eleven associated subordinates with him, and for whose instruction and service he was probably answerable. These would, of course, multiply up to the <span class="cmt_word">two hundred four score and eight</span> mentioned in the verse. This verse appears (contrary to the interpretation of Keil, Bertheau, and others) with sufficient precision to mark <span class="accented">two</span> classes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, the latter <span class="accented">not</span> embracing the former, but the two together making up the two hundred and eighty-eight spoken cf. These two classes will surely satisfy the "teacher and the scholar" classification of the following verse; the classes are denoted by the same Hebrew roots. In ver. 7 the passive Pual participle of the instructed and the Hiphil participle of the cunning, or skilled, correspond exactly with the "scholar" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) and the "teacher" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) of ver. 8. The contents of vers. 9-31 point to the same, being as they are without an allusion to any other outsiders - to any but the already introduced names of "sons" and "brethren." The supposing, therefore, of any allusion here to the "four thousand" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a> seems unnecessary and unnatural in whatever way they were distributed - and probably enough it was in an analogous manner - no distinct reference is made to them here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>25:1-31 The singers and musicians. - David put those in order who were appointed to be singers and musicians in the temple. To prophesy, in this place, means praising God with great earnestness and devout affections, under the influences of the Holy Spirit. In raising these affections, poetry and music were employed. If the Spirit of God do not put life and fervour into our devotions, they will, however ordered, be a lifeless, worthless form.</body></html>
