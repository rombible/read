Sennacherib speaks of the flight of Luli, "king of Zidon," from Tyre. Esarhaddon mentions Baal of Tyre as a tributary.

(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-8.htm" title="The sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.">1Chronicles 1:8</a>, Note.) The Hittites were once the dominant race of Syria and Palestine. Carchemish, on the Euphrates, and Kadesh, as well as Hamath, appear to have been Hittite cities. Their kings had commercial relations with Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm" title="And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.">1Kings 10:29</a>). Inscriptions, in a kind of mixed hieroglyph, have been found at Hamath and Carchemish, but they still await decipherment.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">The Jebusite.</span>--The men of Jebus, or Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-4.htm" title="And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.">1Chronicles 11:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Amorite.</span>--The hill-men of the trans-Jordan.<p><span class= "bld">Girgashite.</span>--Perhaps of Gergesa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a>).<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Hivite.</span>--On the slopes of Lebanon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm" title="And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.">Joshua 11:3</a>), "under Hermon," but also in Gibeon and Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm" title="And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Peradventure you dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?">Joshua 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-2.htm" title="And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.">Genesis 34:2</a>). Delitzsch suggests that the name is connected with Hamath (Assyrian, Hammath as Hawath).<p><span class= "bld">Arkite, and the Sinite.</span>--Tribes living to the west of northern Lebanon. A fragment of the annals of Tiglath-pileser mentions along with Simyra the towns of Arqa and Sianu "on the sea-coast" (B C, 739).

When compared with other places, there are some differences found; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless God that the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The original of the Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that God created, and is thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, and absurd origins assigned to other nations. But the nations now are all so mingled with one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Only this we are sure of, that God has created of one blood all nations of men; they are all descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us?
