But the name should rather be spelt Mizrim--the Egyptians; the form Mizraim being probably a mere fancy of the Jewish punctuators. The Assyrians wrote Mucum, Mucru, Mucur. The Inscription of Darius has Micir. Macor was the name of the wall which protected Egypt on the north-east. Hence it gave its name to the whole of Lower Egypt.--Cush and Mucur are coupled together in the inscriptions of Esarhaddon and his son Assurbanipal.<p><span class= "bld">Put.</span>--Perhaps the Egyptian <span class= "ital">Punt,</span> on the east coast of Africa.

The land of Nimrod is plainly Babylonia; and some have supposed the primitive inhabitants of Babylonia--"the black-headed race" (<span class= "ital">zalmat qayqadi</span>) as they styled themselves--to have been akin to the peoples of Mucur and Cush. At all events, Cush in this table of races appears as father of a series of mixed populations, ramifying from the north-west of the Persian Gulf in a southernly direction to the coast of Arabia. The Asiatic Cush represents that primitive Elamitic Sumerian race which occupied the north-west and north coast of the Persian Gulf; or rather that portion of it which attained to empire in Babylonia.<p>The name Nimrod appears to be identical with Merodach, the Accadian Amar-utu, or Amar-utuki, Assyrian Maruduk. Merodach was the tutelar deity of Babylon, as Asshur was of Assyria; and many Babylonian sovereigns bore his name. (Comp. Merodach-baladan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm" title="At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.">Isaiah 39:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He began to be.</span>--<span class= "ital">He was the first to become.</span> Tradition made Nimrod the first founder of a great Oriental empire. The statement about his four cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>), the first of which was Babel (Babylon), is omitted here.<p><span class= "bld">Mighty.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a hero, warrior </span>(<span class= "ital">gibbor</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> a title of Merodach.<p>(11, 12) The names in these verses are all in the masculine plural, and obviously designate nations. Mizraim, the two Egypts, is said to have begotten the chief races inhabiting those regions--a common Oriental metaphor. The Ludim are the Ludu, or Rudu, of the hieroglyphs (Prof. Sayce thinks, the Lydian mercenaries of the Egyptian sovereigns); the Anamim are perhaps the men of An (On, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-50.htm" title="And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.">Genesis 41:50</a>), Lehabim, the Lybians. The Naphtuhim seem to get their name from Noph, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Memphis, and the god Ptah. Perhaps, however, the name is to be recognised in the town Napata.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Pathrusim.</span>--The men of the south (Egyptian, <span class= "ital">pe-ta-res,</span> "the southland"), or Upper Egypt.<p><span class= "bld">Casluhim</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "bld">Caphthorim.</span>--The men of Kaft-ra, or the Delta. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm" title="Are you not as children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? said the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?">Amos 9:7</a> : "Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Mizraim? and the Philistines from Caphtor?" and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm" title="And the Avims which dwelled in Hazerim, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelled in their stead.)">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>.)

LIST OF THE SONS, GRANDSONS, AND GREAT-GRANDSONS OF HAM. This list consists of four sons of Ham, of six grandsons, including <span class="cmt_word">Nimrod</span>, through <span class="cmt_word">Cush</span>, the eldest son of <span class="cmt_word">Ham</span>; of seven grandsons through <span class="cmt_word">Mizraim</span>, the second son of Ham; of eleven grandsons through <span class="cmt_word">Canaan</span>, the fourth son of Ham; of two great-grandsons through <span class="cmt_word">Raamah</span>, Cush's fourth son; - thirty descendants in all. No issue is given of <span class="cmt_word">Put</span>, the third son of Hem. The parallel list is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6-20</a>. The names agree in the Authorized Version, with minute differences, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Put here for Phut there, and so the <span class="cmt_word">Philistines</span> for Philistine, <span class="cmt_word">Caphthorim</span> for Caphtorim, <span class="cmt_word">Girgashite</span> for Girgasite. They are similarly in agreement in the Hebrew text of the two places, with minute differences, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> here for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> there; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span>. However, in Genesis the following statements are added to Nimrod's name: - "He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty. hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; the same is a great city." And again, at the close of the enumeration of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons, follow the statements, "And afterwards were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comsat to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-27 This chapter, and many that follow, repeat the genealogies, or lists of fathers and children in the Bible history, and put them together, with many added. When compared with other places, there are some differences found; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless God that the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The original of the Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that God created, and is thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, and absurd origins assigned to other nations. But the nations now are all so mingled with one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Only this we are sure of, that God has created of one blood all nations of men; they are all descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Mal 2:10.</body></html>
