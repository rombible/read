The Israelites are known as "sons of Israel," the Ammonites as "sons of Ammon" (Authorised version, "children"). In the same way, an Arab tribe is called. the "Beni Hassan" (sons of Hassan), and Assurbanipal styles his subjects "sons of Asshur." Sometimes a people is called "sons" of the land or city they inhabit; <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the Babylonians are styled "sons of Babel."

With the name Gog compare Gagu, king of Salii, mentioned in connection with Assurbanipal's campaign against the Manna-a.

LIST OF SONS AND GRANDSONS OF JAPHETH. After the mention of Noah's three sons, in the order of their age (though some on slender ground think Ham the youngest), this order, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>, is reversed; and the compiler, beginning with <span class="cmt_word">Japheth</span>, the youngest, apparently with the view of disposing of what his purpose may not so particularly require, gives the names of seven sons and seven grandsons, viz. three through <span class="cmt_word">Gomar</span>, the eldest son, and four through <span class="cmt_word">Javan</span>, the fourth son. These fourteen names are identical in the Authorized Version with the list of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-4</a>. The Septuagint, though not identical in the spelling of the four names <span class="cmt_word">Madai</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Tiras</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Kittim</span>, shows no material differences in the two places. In the Hebrew, according to the text and edition consulted, very slight variations are found in the orthography of Tubal (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> here for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) and Tarshish (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> here for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>)and in the adoption of <span class="cmt_word">Riphath</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Dodanim</span> in this book for <span class="accented">Diphath</span> and <span class="accented">Rodanim.</span> The names <span class="accented">Kittim</span> and <span class="accented">Dodanim</span> look less like names of individuals than of such family, tribe, or nation as descended from the individual. At the close of this short enumeration, we have in Genesis the statement, "By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations." It is evident here also that, whether the compiler borrowed from the Book of Genesis itself, or from some common source open to both, his objects are not exactly the same. Time and the present position and condition of that part of his people for which he was writing governed him, and dictated the difference. Accordingly we do not pause here on the colonizings and the fresh seats and habitations of the sons and grandsons of <span class="accented">Japheth.</span> The subject, one of extreme interest, and the threads of it perhaps not so hopelessly lost as is sometimes thought, belongs to the place in Genesis from which the above verse is cited. It may, however, be written here that the rather verbose disquisitions of Joseph Mede are neither altogether unin-retorting nor in some parts of them unlikely. They form Discourses 47, 48, bk. 1. (edit. 'The Works of Joseph Mode.' London, 1664). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-27 This chapter, and many that follow, repeat the genealogies, or lists of fathers and children in the Bible history, and put them together, with many added. When compared with other places, there are some differences found; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless God that the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The original of the Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that God created, and is thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, and absurd origins assigned to other nations. But the nations now are all so mingled with one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Only this we are sure of, that God has created of one blood all nations of men; they are all descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us?
