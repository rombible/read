According to the chronicler David started from that point, and brought his line of defences round to it again. Samuel has simply, "And David built around, from the Millo, and inward." This seems to mean that he carried his buildings from the fortress towards the interior of the city. Both statements may, of course, be true.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Millo</span>. There is great uncertainty as to the derivation and the meaning of this word. It is probably not really of Hebrew extraction, but of the oldest Canaanitish origin. In the Hebrew it is always used with the article, and would presumably come from the Hebrew root "to fill." Josephus seems to use, as synonymous expression for "<span class="accented">David's wall round Millo</span>," this, viz. "buildings round about the lower city" ('Jud. Ant.,' 3:2, compared with 5; 'Wars,' 6:1, where he identifies those "buildings," etc., with <span class="accented">Acra</span>). As the name of a family, it is mentioned in connection with Shechem, known specially as a place of the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>). The Septuagint represents it by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. In the remarkable passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>, the word "Silla" is even a greater enigma, which, however, may designate the "steps from the city of David" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>), or "the <span class="accented">causeway of going up"</span> to the west of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-16.htm">1 Chronicles 22:16</a>). The likeliest view of Mille is that it was a very strong point of fortification in the surrounding defences of the hill of Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a> the otherwise unvarying translation (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Septuagint is superseded by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, a word itself of doubtful signification. For while some would render it by the word "foundation," Schleusner translates it "height." Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:367) puts it in "the neighbourhood of the Tyropaean valley at the foot of Zion." Some clue may lie in the word "inward," applied to the building by David. Does it imply a covering by edifices of the space, or some portion of it, that lay between Zion and the rest of the city? (See also Keil on Kings, vol. 2:163.) <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 David was brought to possess the throne of Israel after he had reigned seven years in Hebron, over Judah only. God's counsels will be fulfilled at last, whatever difficulties lie in the way. The way to be truly great, is to be really useful, to devote all our talents to the Lord.</body></html>
