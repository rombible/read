The chronicler resumes, after the parenthetic explanation of the last verse, with "These, the number of the warriors." The word "number" (<span class= "ital">mispar</span>) seems to refer to the fact that the corps was originally known as the Thirty (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-12.htm" title="And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.">1Chronicles 11:12</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-23.htm" title="And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.">1Chronicles 12:23</a>, the plural (<span class= "ital">mispere</span>) is used.<p><span class= "bld">Jashobeam, an Hachmonite.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Jasho-beam, son of a Hakmonite;</span> but <span class= "ital">ben</span> may be spurious, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-7.htm" title="And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,">1Chronicles 9:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-10.htm" title="Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.">Nehemiah 11:10</a>. The Hebrew of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm" title="These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.">2Samuel 23:8</a> has <span class= "ital">yoshebbashshebeth Tahkemoni,</span> which has been supposed to be a corruption of <span class= "ital">Ishbosheth ha-hahmoni</span> ("Ishbosheth the Hachmonite"). If this guess be right, the Jashobeam of our text may be a disguise of Eshbaal. This seems to be borne out by the readings of the Vatican LXX<span class= "bld">.</span> here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-2.htm" title="Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:2</a> : <span class= "greekheb">????????</span> and <span class= "greekheb">??????</span><span class= "ital">.</span> The Alex. MS., however, reads <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> and <span class= "greekheb">??????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> that is, Jashobeam.<p><span class= "bld">The chief of the captains.</span>--The Hebrew text has "head of the Thirty," and so the LXX. and Syriac. "Captains" ("knights," or "members of the royal staff.") is the reading of Samuel and the Hebrew margin here. The corps of the Thirty may also have been called the Knights; but the two Hebrew words might easily be confused (<span class= "ital">shelashim, shalishim</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It is possible that the original reading was "head of the Three" (<span class= "ital">sheloshah</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/11-11.htm" title="And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.">1Chronicles 11:11-14</a> describe an exploit of three champions.<p><span class= "bld">He lifted up his spear.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">he it was who brandished his lance over three hundred slain in a single encounter.</span> Samuel says eight hundred, but. the text there is otherwise very faulty. Yet as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-20.htm" title="And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.">1Chronicles 11:20</a> records that the lesser hero, Abishai, slew three hundred, the greater number may be correct here. (Comp. the like exploit of Shamgar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm" title="And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.">Judges 3:31</a>), and the feats ascribed to Rameses II. and to the heroes of the Iliad.) A well-armed champion might cut down whole companies of ordinary fighting-men.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the number</span>.

The sentence should probably be, "These are the names" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jashobeam</span>. In the parallel passage, this name is supplied by the words "The Tachmonite <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, Authorized Version, "that sat in the seat" (see the previous verse), probably in error for our <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (see Kennicott's 'Dissert.,' 82). His immediate paternal ancestor seems to have been Zabdiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-2.htm">1 Chronicles 27:2</a>).

The Authorized Version follows the Keri (which is distinguished from the Chethiv by a <span class="accented">yod</span> in place of a <span class="accented">vau</span>), and translates <span class="accented">captains.</span> It seems better (vers. 15, 25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-6.htm">1 Chronicles 27:6</a>) to abide by the Chethiv, and translate "the chief of the <span class="accented">thirty."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>He lifted up his spear</span>. Notice the probable error in Samuel, occasioned by some similarity in the Hebrew letters. "The same was Adino the Eznite." The number of Jashobeam's victims is stated at "eight hundred" in the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>).
