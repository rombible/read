Why they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.">2Samuel 5:8</a>, reads, "And David said in that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusite, let him hurl down the waterfall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm" title="Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterspouts: all your waves and your billows are gone over me.">Psalm 42:7</a>), both the lame and the blind, the hated of David's soul! Therefore they say, Blind and lame must not enter the house" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Temple). Such is the simplest rendering of an obscure, but evidently original record. The chronicler appears to have followed another and clearer account, which made Joab play at the storm of Jebus the part of Othniel at that of Kirjath-sepher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-12.htm" title="And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.">Judges 1:12-13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Chief and captain.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">shall become a head and a captain.</span><p><span class= "bld">Joab the son of Zeruiah</span> is not mentioned at all in the parallel passage. Joab already appears as David's general, while Ishbosheth is yet reigning at Mahanaim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.">2Samuel 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-23.htm" title="When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.">2Samuel 3:23</a>). Perhaps the phrase here used means head and governor of Jerusalem. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm" title="And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.">1Chronicles 11:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Went up.</span>--Scaled the rampart, "and became a head."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The name and fresh glory of Joab, as given here, are not given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3-10</a>; and we could suppose that they were purposely withheld there. It is true that Joab already held high office, probably the first place as captain of David's men, but Bertheau's objection to the statements of this verse on such grounds easily yields to the considerations - first, that there can be no doubt Joab had fallen into disfavour with David <span class="accented">and others</span>, upon his slaying of Abner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26-29, 36, 37</a>); and further, that this was a great occasion, exceedingly favourable for evoking any very special ability of younger or unknown men, at present lost under the shadow of larger growths. The advantage which Joab gained now was one that confirmed his position and increased largely his influence; and an indication that he was not slow to avail himself of it is probably to be traced in the eighth verse, where it is said while "David built... even from Millo round about,... Joab repaired the rest of the city." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 David was brought to possess the throne of Israel after he had reigned seven years in Hebron, over Judah only. God's counsels will be fulfilled at last, whatever difficulties lie in the way. The way to be truly great, is to be really useful, to devote all our talents to the Lord.</body></html>
