(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-9.htm" title="Now therefore listen to their voice: however, yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.">1Samuel 8:9</a> <span class= "ital">seq.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-25.htm" title="Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.">1Samuel 10:25</a>.) Representative institutions appear to have been the rule in the best period of Israel's national existence. The elders or hereditary heads of the tribal subdivisions met in council to discuss and settle matters of national concern. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-23.htm" title="And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.">1Chronicles 12:23</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Before the Lord.</span>--In the presence of the high priest, and perhaps before the ark; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm" title="Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-25.htm" title="If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?

A forcible use of this phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>. It implies that the engagement was ratified in the presence of a holy place, a holy vessel of the sanctuary, or a holy person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>). Whether the tabernacle was now at Hebron is doubtful, but the two priests, Abiathar and Zadok, were. <span class="cmt_word">They anointed David</span>. The first time of David's being anointed (l <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 13</a>) Samuel the prophet officiated. The second time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>) was when the "men of Judah" anointed him king over "the house of Judah." This third time when David was anointed king over the united people, it was at all events at the special instance of "all the elders of Israel," although who officiated on these two last occasions is not mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord by Samuel</span>. The sentence marks the complete fulfilment of what had been foreshadowed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12, 13</a>; and it may probably have been the more carefully introduced by the compiler of Chronicles, in consideration of the absence from his own work of previous details and of the previous anointings of David. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 David was brought to possess the throne of Israel after he had reigned seven years in Hebron, over Judah only. God's counsels will be fulfilled at last, whatever difficulties lie in the way. The way to be truly great, is to be really useful, to devote all our talents to the Lord.</body></html>
