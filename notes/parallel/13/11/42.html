Syriac reads "and he was commanding thirty men," which gives the apparent meaning of the verse. If, as seems likely, the "thirty" were the officers of David's guard of six hundred warriors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-13.htm" title="Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he declined to go forth.">1Samuel 23:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-10.htm" title="But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.">1Samuel 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm" title="And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.">2Samuel 15:18</a>), called "the mighty men," or heroes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-7.htm" title="And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.">2Samuel 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-7.htm" title="And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.">2Samuel 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-8.htm" title="But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.">1Kings 1:8</a>). each captain would lead about twenty men.

The Hebrew preposition here translated "with" appears thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, and will naturally translate "and in addition to him." As he was a captain, this addendum may probably refer to those over whom he was captain, and whom he brought in his train, and who were possibly themselves officers. As the writer of Chronicles indicates no difference, nor any sense of a change of persons enumerated, when he has reached (ver. 41) Uriah the Hittite, it would all the rather be consistent with his own superscription when (ver. 26) he proposes to set forth simply "the valiant men of the armies" without confining their number to the "thirty." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:10-47 An account is given of David's worthies, the great men who served him. Yet David reckoned his success, not as from the mighty men that were with him, but from the mighty God, whose presence is all in all. In strengthening him, they strengthened themselves and their own interest, for his advancement was theirs. We shall gain by what we do in our places for the support of the kingdom of the Son of David; and those that are faithful to Him, shall find their names registered much more to their honour, than these are in the records of fame.</body></html>
