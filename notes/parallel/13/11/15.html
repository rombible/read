Samuel has "at (or towards) harvest," <span class= "ital">'el qacir.</span> In Hebrew writing the phrases are very similar. Our phrase looks like a correction of that in Samuel. At any rate, the Syriac, Targum, Arabic, and probably the LXX., read <span class= "ital">qacir</span> in the MSS. of Samuel. Here the LXX. has "to the rock;" Syriac omits the phrase.<p><span class= "bld">Cave of Adullam.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm" title="David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.">1Samuel 22:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Encamped.</span>--<span class= "ital">Were camping.</span><p><span class= "bld">Valley of Rephaim.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>, Note.

The <span class="accented">thirty</span> here alluded to have not been mentioned either in the Book of Samuel or here, except by implication of our ver. 11, where we might imagine the sense to be, "Now these are the names of the mighty men, <span class="accented">in number thirty</span>, whom David had, viz. Jashobeam, an <span class="accented">Hachmonite</span>, <span class="accented">the chief of the thirty."</span> Nor are we told in either place who were the "three" here spoken cf. The article is absent in both places, or it would be convenient and natural to suppose that the three just mentioned are those intended, which cannot, however, be taken for granted. The language of vers. 20-22, 25, might rather indicate that the three mentioned in those verses are those in question. The repeated uncertainty in which we are left on matters to which no intrinsic difficulty adheres seems evidence of injured manuscripts rather than of anything else. <span class="cmt_word">To the rock to David</span>. This is the right reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;</span>; and that in the parallel passage ("to <span class="accented">David in the harvest-time"</span>) is not correct, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The cave of Adullam</span>. Adullam, evidently a place of great antiquity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>:l, 12, 20), is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>; it was the seat then of a Canaanite king. It afterwards lay in Judah, in that lowland (called often the Shephelah) that ran from Joppa to Gaza, near the Mediterranean Sea. It kept name and fame to the last (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>). The "rock" marks the limestone cliffs of the region (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 254-259, edit. 1866). We read of it, as David's refuge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>). From our present passage, and its parallel we should have concluded that it could not have been far from Bethlehem. In this sense Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 606, 607) refers to the tradition that fixes the cave at a spot now called <span class="accented">Khureitun</span>, between Bethlehem and the Dead Sea, and says, "Leaving our horses in charge of wild Arabs, and taking one Arab for a guide, we started for the cave, having a fearful gorge below, gigantic cliffs above, and the path winding along a shelf of the rock, narrow enough to make the nervous among us shudder. At length from a great rock, hanging on the edge of this shelf, we sprang by a long leap into a low window, which opened into the perpendicular face of the cliff. We were then within the hold of David, and creeping half-doubled through a narrow crevice for a few rods, we stood beneath the dark vault of the first grand chamber of this mysterious and oppressive cavern. Our whole collection of lights did little more than make the damp darkness visible. After groping about as long as we had Lime to spare, we returned to the light of day, fully convinced that, with David and his lion-hearted followers inside, all the strength of Israel under Saul could not have forced an entrance, and would not even have attempted it." <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">host</span>. For this word "host" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>) the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>) has the "life of the Philistines" (but the Authorized Version, the "troop of"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beasts and cattle of the Philistines. So also the Syriac Version translates, The Septuagint shows in this place <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, and in Samuel <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">valley of Rephaim</span>. The situation of this notable valley is not certain. Yet there can be little doubt, in spite of Furst ('Handwortbuch,' 2:383), who supposes a situation north-west of Jerusalem, that it must be near Bethlehem, and therefore south-west of the city. The word employed Here for "valley" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> should mark an <span class="accented">enclosed</span> one. <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> means "giants." Hence our Authorized Version, "The valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>; comp. with our present passage; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-22.htm">2 Samuel 5:22</a> comp. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-9.htm">1 Chronicles 14:9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:10-47 An account is given of David's worthies, the great men who served him. Yet David reckoned his success, not as from the mighty men that were with him, but from the mighty God, whose presence is all in all. In strengthening him, they strengthened themselves and their own interest, for his advancement was theirs. We shall gain by what we do in our places for the support of the kingdom of the Son of David; and those that are faithful to Him, shall find their names registered much more to their honour, than these are in the records of fame.</body></html>
