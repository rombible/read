Sixteen names are here added to the list as given in Samuel. The chronicler, therefore, possessed a source more complete than our Book of Samuel. Variations of spelling abound in the names common to the two texts, the transcription of proper names being especially liable to error.<p>(26) <span class= "bld">Also the valiant men of the armies.</span>--The Heb. phrase has this meaning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm" title="And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes on the mountains;">1Chronicles 12:8</a>); but elsewhere it denotes "valiant heroes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-5.htm" title="And their brothers among all the families of Issachar were valiant men of might, reckoned in all by their genealogies fourscore and seven thousand.">1Chronicles 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-7.htm" title="And the sons of Bela; Ezbon, and Uzzi, and Uzziel, and Jerimoth, and Iri, five; heads of the house of their fathers, mighty men of valor; and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four.">1Chronicles 7:7</a>, &c). and so here. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-24.htm" title="Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,">2Samuel 23:24</a> has "Asahel brother of Joab was among the thirty." It thus appears that the warriors of this list are none other than the famous baud of thirty warriors already spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-15.htm" title="Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.">1Chronicles 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-25.htm" title="Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.">1Chronicles 11:25</a>). From having been the original number, <span class= "ital">thirty</span> may have become the conventional name of the corps even when its limits had been enlarged. It is notice. able that so far as to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm" title="Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,">1Chronicles 11:41</a> the heroes are arranged in pairs, and that the gentilic or cantonal name is usually added to that of the hero. They mostly belong to Judah and Benjamin; whereas the sixteen additional names, so far as known, belong to the transjordanic tribes, and the northern tribes are not represented at all.<p><span class= "bld">Elhanan.</span>--<span class= "ital">Dodo</span> is very much like <span class= "ital">David.</span> Is this a third <span class= "ital">alias</span> of the slayer of Goliath? See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm" title="And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.">1Chronicles 20:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-41.</span> - These verses correspond with vers. 24-39 in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a>, and with them the subject ends there, though not here. The list announced here as comprising "the valiant men of the armies," is unannounced there, but, beginning with the same name, <span class="cmt_word">Asahel</span>, it calls him "one of the thirty," and suggests the inference that those who follow will make up the rest. The number that follows (coinciding in this respect strictly with our list here) is itself thirty, which, though one too many, may be considered satisfactorily accounted for in the fact of the untimely death of Asahel, already recorded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>). Considering the exact crisis at which he died, it is very likely that his place should be compensated for, although his name were unremoved from the honourable list. Amid the difficulties that develop themselves in the <span class="accented">contents</span> of these lists, when compared, the comparison of them aids the conviction that, so far as they go together, they do stand for "the thirty" spoken of in both places, and that a sentence or two here and there, now lost or corrupted beyond recognition, would clear up the whole subject. The comparison also seems to make it clear that the compiler of Chronicles, meaning to go beyond an enumeration of the <span class="accented">thirty</span>, nowhere speaks of thirty after ver. 25. On the other hand, the writer of the account in Samuel carefully sums up all (ver. 39) in the words, "<span class="accented">thirty</span> <span class="accented">and seven in all</span> " - an addition which means either the actual thirty-one given and the two sets of three each; or the thirty, with the two sets of three each and Joab ever all. Our present chapter, however, goes on to the number forty-eight in all, vers. 41-47, adding sixteen to the thirty-two which precede. Beside some minor differences, it must be said that at fewest three names, <span class="accented">Hepher</span>, <span class="accented">Ahijah</span>, and <span class="accented">Mibhar</span>, in Chronicles, resist identification with those that should (from position) correspond with them in the list of Samuel and with any others. And the same thing may be said of the same number in the list of Samuel (<span class="accented">Elika</span>, <span class="accented">Eliam</span>, <span class="accented">Bani</span>) when compared with the list now before us. The points of contact and clearest identification are, therefore, in so great a majority and are so uniformly distributed that, although it is left hard to decide the causes of them, these differences cannot throw any discredit upon the list as a whole. Perhaps the most probable suggestion to be offered is that the knowledge of the writer of the Book of Samuel enabled him to supersede the names of such as were soon lost to their brave career by death by other names; or, resting on the same fundamental reason, there may have been two different <span class="accented">editions</span> of the list, to one of which the writer of Samuel was indebted, and to the other the compiler of Chronicles. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:10-47 An account is given of David's worthies, the great men who served him. Yet David reckoned his success, not as from the mighty men that were with him, but from the mighty God, whose presence is all in all. In strengthening him, they strengthened themselves and their own interest, for his advancement was theirs. We shall gain by what we do in our places for the support of the kingdom of the Son of David; and those that are faithful to Him, shall find their names registered much more to their honour, than these are in the records of fame.</body></html>
