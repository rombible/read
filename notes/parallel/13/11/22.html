The Syriac has "Benaiah son of Joiada, a strong warrior." The LXX., however, reads, "son of a mighty man."<p><span class= "bld">Kabzeel.</span>--A town of southern Judah, site unknown (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm" title="And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,">Joshua 15:21</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-25.htm" title="And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelled at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and in the villages thereof,">Nehemiah 11:25</a> (Jekabzeel).<p><span class= "bld">Who had done many acts.</span>--The margin is correct.

So the Syriac: "He slew two giants of Moab." The Hebrew has, "He smote the two Ariel of Moab." Ariel, "lion of God"--a title of heroes with the Arabs and Persians--appears to be used as an appellative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-7.htm" title="Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.">Isaiah 33:7</a>): "Lo, the heroes (<span class= "ital">'arielim</span>) cry without!"

Benaiah was, therefore, a Levite by tribe, though Kabzeel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>) was in Judah far south. He was "captain of the host for the third month... and in his course were twenty and four thousand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>). When in our ver. 25 it is said that "David set him over his guard," the allusion probably is to his uniform and prolonged command of "the Cherethites and Pelethites" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>).

Yet David reckoned his success, not as from the mighty men that were with him, but from the mighty God, whose presence is all in all. In strengthening him, they strengthened themselves and their own interest, for his advancement was theirs. We shall gain by what we do in our places for the support of the kingdom of the Son of David; and those that are faithful to Him, shall find their names registered much more to their honour, than these are in the records of fame.</body></html>
