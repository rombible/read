It was not as if David were some valiant foreigner, like certain of his own heroes. Moreover, the affection and sympathy of the tribes were with him, whose life of struggle and success had marked him out as their divinely chosen leader.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Upon the death of Saul, Abner, for a while espousing the cause of Ishbo-sheth, the only surviving son of Saul, "made him king over" a large proportion of the people, exclusive of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-10</a>). Already David had been anointed at Hebron by "the men of Judah, king over the house of Judah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>). And David continued "king in Hebron over the house of Judah seven years and six months" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-4.htm">1 Chronicles 3:4</a>). Notice the agreement of this date with the account of the six sons born to David in Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>). The explanation of the chronology for Ishbosheth affecting this period is not easy. It is said that he reigned over Israel "two years" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>). Where was the difference of five and a half years lost? Our first verse here, with its apparently emphatic <span class="cmt_word">then</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>), would seem to make it very unlikely that it was lost between the death of Ishbosheth and the kingship of David over "all the tribes of Israel" together with Judah. On the other hand, the interval in question might find its account in the "<span class="accented">long war</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1, 6, 17-21</a>) between the house of Saul and the house of David." There is, however, still possible the supposition that the historian intends to give the intrinsically correct facts of the case, and means that, what with delay before getting the adhesion of the people to Ishbosheth, and what with the early decay of his sovereign power, he could not be said to have <span class="accented">reigned</span> more than two years. This verse, then, shows that the history proper of Chronicles purports to begin from the time of David's rule over the entire and united people, at the exact date of seven and a half years after Saul's death, while no mention is here made of his intermediate partial rule over Judah, or of Ishbosheth's temporary rule over Benjamin and Israel. <span class="cmt_word">All Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the tribes of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>), by their representatives, "the elders of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>; as well as our ver. 3). The first nine verses of this chapter cover the same ground as the first ten verses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5</a>. Unto Hebron. We learn how David came to be here from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>. "And it came to pass after this" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> after David's "lamentation over Saul and Jonathan") "that David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron." Hebron was the "earliest seat of civilized life, not of Judah only, but of all Palestine." It and Bethlehem are two of the most special memorials of David. An interesting sketch of the topography and natural features of this place, and a succinct Biblical history of it in Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 164 (edit. 1866), from which comes the following quotation: - "Hebron, according to the Jewish tradition, was the primeval city of the vine. Its name indicates <span class="accented">community or society.</span> It was the ancient city of Ephron the Hittite, in whose gate he and the elders received the offer of Abraham, when as yet no other fixed habitation of man was known in central Palestine. It was the first home of Abraham and the patriarchs; their own permanent resting-place when they were gradually exchanging the pastoral for the agricultural life. In its neighbourhood can be traced, by a continuous tradition, the site of the venerable tree under which Abraham pitched his tent, and of the double cavern in which he and his family were deposited and perhaps still remain. It was the city of Arba, the old Canaanite chief, with his three giant sons, under whose walls the trembling spies stole through the land by the adjacent valley of Eshcoh Here Caleb chose his portion when, at the head of his valiant tribe, he drove out the old inhabitants, and called the whole surrounding territory after his own name; and here the tribe of Judah always rallied, when it asserted its independent existence against the rest of the Israelite nation. It needs but few words to give the secret of this early selection, of this long continuance of the metropolitan city of Judah. Every traveller from the desert must have been struck by the sight of that pleasant vale, with its orchards and vineyards and numberless wells, and we must add, in earlier times, the groves of terebinths and oaks which then attracted from far the eye of the wandering tribes. This fertility was in part owing to its elevation into the cooler and the more watered region above the dry and withered valleys of the rest of Judaea - and commanding this fertile valley, rose Hebron, on its crested hill." <span class="cmt_word">Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh</span>.
