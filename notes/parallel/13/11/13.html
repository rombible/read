The name does not now appear in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-5.htm" title="Although my house be not so with God; yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.">2Samuel 23:5</a>, being probably concealed under the word rendered "when they defied."<p><span class= "bld">And there the Philistines were gathered together to battle.</span>--After these words several lines have been lost, as may be seen by comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:">2Samuel 23:9-10</a>. The text may be restored thus: "He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines had gathered to the battle; and the men of Israel went up (perhaps, up the mountain side, in retreat). And he stood his ground, and smote the Philistines until his hand was benumbed, and clave to the sword. And Iahweh wrought a great victory on that day. And the people began returning (from flight) behind him only to spoil (the slain). And after him (was) Shammah ben Age, an Hararite. And the Philistines gathered together unto Lehi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-9.htm" title="Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.">Judges 15:9</a>). And there there was a parcel, etc.," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.">1Chronicles 11:13</a>. The cause of this serious omission was perhaps the double occurrence of the phrase "the Philistines gathered together." The eye of some copyist wandered from one to the other. What was originally told of Eleazar the second hero, was that his prowess turned the flight at Pas-dammim into a victory.<p><span class= "bld">Where was a parcel of ground full of barley.</span>--The scene of the exploit of the third hero, Shammah, son of Age. Perhaps the Philistines were intent on carrying off the crop (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-1.htm" title="Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors.">1Samuel 23:1</a>). Samuel reads lentils. The Hebrew words for barley and lentils are very similar. We cannot tell which text is right.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pas-dammim</span>. This word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a> as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, and is supposed to mean, in either form, "the boundary of blood;" it was the scene of frequent conflicts with the Philistines, and was the spot where they were encamped at the time of Goliath's challenge to Israel. It was near Shocoh, or Soech, in Judah, some fourteen miles south-west of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Full of barley</span>. The Authorized Version reading in the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a>) is "full of lentiles," the Hebrew for "barley" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, for "lentiles" <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Possibly the words should be the same, one being here spelt, by accident, wrongly for the other (so Kennicott). The first Bible mention of "barley" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 32</a>, from which verses we learn that it, together with "flax," was an earlier crop than "rye" and "wheat." It was not only used for food for man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>), but also for horses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-28.htm">1 Kings 4:28</a>). That it was nevertheless of the less-valued grain, we have significant indications, in its being prescribed for the "jealousy offering" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>, comp. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), and in its being part of the purchase price of the adulteress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>). Its derivation in the Hebrew, from a verbal root signifying "to bristle," is in noticeable analogy with the Latin <span class="accented">hordeum</span>, from <span class="accented">horreo.</span> Gesenius's observation, that the singular of the word given above in the Hebrew marks the "growing crop," and the plural the "grain" itself, seems hardly corroborated by this single passage at all events. The <span class="accented">lentile</span>, on the other hand, was a species of <span class="accented">bean</span>, and used much for soup, of which Egyptian tomb-paintings furnish illustration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9</a>). Sonnini, in his 'Travels' (translation of Hunter, 3:288), tells us that still the Egyptian poor eat <span class="accented">lentile-bread</span>, but, what is more <span class="accented">apropos</span> of this passage, that in making it they prefer to mix a little "barley" with it. This apparent discrepancy between the parallel accounts not only counts in itself for very little, but may easily be surmounted by supposing that, though it be written that the "parcel" of ground was "full of lentiles," and again "full of barley," the description may only amount to this, that such parcels were in close juxtaposition. But if not, our allusion above to the possible error in the Hebrew words will sufficiently explain the variation. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:10-47 An account is given of David's worthies, the great men who served him. Yet David reckoned his success, not as from the mighty men that were with him, but from the mighty God, whose presence is all in all. In strengthening him, they strengthened themselves and their own interest, for his advancement was theirs. We shall gain by what we do in our places for the support of the kingdom of the Son of David; and those that are faithful to Him, shall find their names registered much more to their honour, than these are in the records of fame.</body></html>
