Literally, <span class= "ital">and David walked on, a walking and growing great</span>--a common Hebrew metaphor of gradual and progressive increase or decrease. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-5.htm" title="And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.">Genesis 8:5</a>, and the use of the term <span class= "ital">andante,</span> "walking," in music.)<p><span class= "bld">Lord of hosts was with him.</span>--The Lord of Hosts is doubtless a contracted form of the fuller expression, Lord God of Hosts, as it appears in Samuel. The Lord (or God) of Hosts is <span class= "bld">a</span> title derived from God's supremacy over the host of heaven, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the stars, worshipped as deities by the races environing Israel, insomuch that the very word for <span class= "ital">God</span> in the old Babylonian is represented by a star (*); and in the later Assyrian character <span class= "ital">star</span> was represented by the symbol for <span class= "ital">God</span> thrice repeated. Assur, the supreme deity of the Assyrian Pantheon, is called in the inscriptions "king of the legions of heaven and earth," or "of the great gods." Similar titles were given to the Babylonian Nebo and Merodach. The Hebrew phrase is therefore, in one sense, equivalent to a concise assertion of the statement, "Jehovah your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm" title="For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not persons, nor takes reward:">Deuteronomy 10:17</a> : comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-3.htm" title="For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.">Psalm 95:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a>). That the hosts in question are the stars appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-20.htm" title="They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.">Judges 5:20</a>.<p>Very anciently the stars were conceived of as the army of heaven, marshalled in orderly array. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.">Isaiah 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/14-12.htm" title="How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how are you cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!">Isaiah 14:12-13</a>.) The Lord of the hosts of heaven is <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> Lord of all earthly hosts; hence the fitness of the phrase in passages like the present. Lastly, we may observe that it is a grand idea of revealed religion that He who guides the stars in their courses guides also the destinies of individual men, elevating one and abasing another, according to the eternal principles of goodness and truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm" title="For thus said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.">Isaiah 57:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 David was brought to possess the throne of Israel after he had reigned seven years in Hebron, over Judah only. God's counsels will be fulfilled at last, whatever difficulties lie in the way. The way to be truly great, is to be really useful, to devote all our talents to the Lord.</body></html>
