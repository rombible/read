Other not less competent scholars believe that the text of Samuel should be corrected from the Chronicles. As regards the name Jaare-oregim (<span class= "ital">forests of weavers--</span>an absurdity), this is plausible. Whether we proceed further in the same direction must depend on the general view we take of the chronicler's relation to the Books of Samuel. It is easy, but hardly satisfactory, to allege that he felt the difficulty, which every modern reader must feel, and altered the text accordingly. The real question is whether he has done this arbitrarily, or upon the evidence of another document than his MS. of Samuel. Now, it is fair to say that (1) hitherto we have observed no signs of arbitrary alteration; (2) we have had abundant proof that the chronicler actually possessed other sources besides Samuel. There is no apparent reason why "Lahmi" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Lahmijah) should not be a <span class= "ital">nomen individui.</span> (Comp. Assyrian <span class= "ital">Lahm-,</span> the name of a god, Tablet I., Creation Series.) It is, however, quite possible that Elhanan is another, and, in fact, the original name of <span class= "ital">David.</span> The appellative David. "the beloved" (comp. Dido), may have gradually supplanted the old Elhanan in the popular memory. Solomon we know was at first named Jodidiah, and it is highly probable that the true designation of the first king of Israel has been lost, the name <span class= "ital">Saul</span> ("the asked") having been given in allusion to the fact that the people had <span class= "ital">ashed</span> for a king. We may compare, besides, the double names Jehoahaz-Shallum, Mattaniah-Zedekiah, and perhaps Uzziah-Azariah. The Targum on Samuel partly supports this suggestion (see the Note there). I would add that <span class= "ital">Jaare</span> in Hebrew writing is an easy corruption of <span class= "ital">Jesse;</span> so that the original reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-19.htm" title="And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.">2Samuel 21:19</a> may have been, "And Elhanan the son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, slew Goliath," &c. In that case, the reading of Chronicles must be considered an unsuccessful emendation, due probably to the compiler whose work the chronicler followed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elhanan the son of Jair</span>. In Samuel Jair appears as <span class="accented">Jaare.</span> This Elhanan is probably different from him of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-26.htm">1 Chronicles 11:26</a>. There is a strange confusion in the reading of this and its parallel verse. If our present verse is to stand corrected by accepting from its parallel "the Bethlehemite" in place of our <span class="accented">Lamhi</span>, then either we have no name given for the brother of Goliath, the Gittite; or, if we drop the word "brother" (changing the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> of Chronicles into the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> of Samuel), and make Goliath the Gittite the man slain by Elhanan, then of such a Goliath we know nothing, and it is a most unlikely coincidence of name with the conquered of David's sling.. Kennicott's seventy-eighth dissertation is occupied, and ably, with the <span class="accented">pros</span> and <span class="accented">cons</span> of this question; and the curiosities of Jerome on the passage may be found in his 'Quaestiones Hebraicae.' There seems no sufficient reason to depart from our reading here, to which it were preferable to adjust the reading in the parallel place, which exhibits almost certainly a glaring corruption of text in another respect. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-8 David's wars. - Though the Lord will severely correct the sins of his believing people, he will not leave them in the hands of their enemies. His assistance will overcome all advantages of number and strength of those that defy his Israel. All that trust in Christ, shall be made more than conquerors through him that loveth them.</body></html>
