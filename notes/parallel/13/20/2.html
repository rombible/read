Two difficulties present themselves in this verse, viz. the reported weight of this crown, and the uncertainty as to what head it was from which David took it. Whatever was its weight, if David's head was able to sustain it for a minute or two, the head of the King of the Ammonites might also occasionally have borne it. Yet it would scarcely be likely that the King of the Ammonites would have so ponderous a crown (calculated at a weight of a hundred and fourteen pounds Troy, or a little more or less than one hundredweight) as one of ordinary wear, or that he would have one of extraordinary wear on his head precisely at such a juncture. Both of these difficulties will remove if we suppose that the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, instead of meaning <span class="cmt_word">their king</span>, is the name of the Ammonitish and Moabitish idol (<span class="accented">i.q.</span> Moloch), and which we find (Authorized Version) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, and probably (though not Authorized Version) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. The Septuagint treats the word thus. The point, however, cannot be considered settled. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-8 David's wars. - Though the Lord will severely correct the sins of his believing people, he will not leave them in the hands of their enemies.
