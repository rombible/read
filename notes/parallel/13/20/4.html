Each word (spelling Gob fully) has three consonants in Hebrew, of which the first is common to both, and the other two are similar enough to make corruption easy. For "Gezer," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm" title="And goes down westward to the coast of Japhleti, to the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at the sea.">Joshua 16:3</a>.

The Syriac Version, however, as well as the Septuagint, has <span class="accented">Gath</span> in that verse as well as in the two verses following (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-18.htm">2 Samuel 21:18-20</a>), another name also easily interchangeable in Hebrew characters with <span class="accented">Gezer.</span> The "yet again" of our ver. 6 would well accord with the supposition that the conflict with the Philistines was at Gath, or at the <span class="accented">same</span> place, each of the three times. <span class="accented">Gezer</span> belonged to Ephraim, and was situated to the north of Philistia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-28.htm">1 Chronicles 7:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-16.htm">1 Chronicles 14:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sibbechai</span> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-29.htm">1 Chronicles 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-11.htm">1 Chronicles 27:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sippai</span>. In the parallel place spelt <span class="accented">Saph.</span> It is remarkable that, in the Peshito Syriac, over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143.htm">Psalm 143</a>, is found the inscription," Of David, when he slew Asaph, the brother of Gulyad, and thanksgiving that he had conquered." <span class="cmt_word">Of the children of the giant</span>. The Hebrew word for "giant," <span class="accented">rapha</span> (always in these verses spelt with a final <span class="accented">aleph</span>, but in the parallel verses always with <span class="accented">he</span> final), is here (Authorized Version) translated.
