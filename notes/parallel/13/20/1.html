There we read more particularly that Joab sent word he had taken the "city of waters," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the lower part of the city (where a stream had its source, and no doubt supplied the city with water), which was very likely the key of the whole position,and called upon David to come up and "encamp against the city and take it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the city, or citadel, which stood upon the heights north of the stream. Glimpses of this kind may suffice to convince us how rapidly a text, really correct, would melt away for us a very large proportion of the whole number of the lesser obstacles which often impede our path in the historical books of the Old Testament. At the time that kings go out. It was no doubt the case that, even in Palestine, the winter was often a period of enforced inactivity. Rabbah. Tim punishment of Ammou for the treatment of David's well-intended embassy of condolence is now about to be completed. The familiar root of Rabbah signifies multitudinous number, and, resulting thence, the greatness of importance. It was the chief city of the Ammonites, if not their only city of importance enough for mention. In five passages its connection with Ammon is coupled with its name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a>), "Rabbah of the children of Ammon."

Rabbah is the proper spelling of the word, except when in a constructive state, as in the above phrase. The relations of Moab and Ammon with Israel are full of interest. After the overthrow of Og, King of Bashan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>), "Moab and Ammon still remained independent allies south and cast of the Israelite settlements. Both fell before David - Moab, evidently the weaker, first; Ammon not without a long resistance, which made the siege and fall of its capital, Rabbah-ammon, the crowning act of David's conquests. The ruins which now adorn the 'royal city' are of a later Roman date; but the commanding position of the citadel remains; and the unusual sight of a living stream abounding in fish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-27.htm">2 Samuel 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>) marks the significance of Joab's song of victory, 'I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters'" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' 323, edit. 1866). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/20.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>20:1-8 David's wars. - Though the Lord will severely correct the sins of his believing people, he will not leave them in the hands of their enemies.
