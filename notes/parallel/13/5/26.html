Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria.</span>--No trace of P-l as distinct from Tiglath-pileser has been found in the Assyrian monuments, which, it must be remembered, are contemporary. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19</a> we read that, "Pul king of Assyria came against the land," in the reign of Menahem, who recognised the Assyrian monarch as his suzerain, and paid a tribute of 1,000 talents of silver. Now Tiglath-pileser II. actually claims to have received tribute of Menahem (<span class= "ital">Menahimmu</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> P-l appears to have been the original name of Tiglath-pileser, which, upon his accession to the throne of Assyria (745 B.C.), he discarded for that of the great king who had ruled the country four centuries before his time. The name P-l has been identified by Dr. Schrader with the Porus of Ptolemy's Canon, <span class= "ital">Por</span> being the Persian pronunciation of P-l. The Syriac here omits "P-l king of Assyria." The LXX. (Vat.) has <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, and the Arabic <span class= "ital">Balaq.</span> Perhaps the chronicler meant to indicate the identity of P-l and Tiglath: "The spirit of Pul <span class= "ital">and </span>(<span class= "ital">=</span> that is) the spirit of Tiglath, and <span class= "ital">he</span> carried them away."<p><span class= "bld">And he carried them away.</span>--Tiglath-pileser is meant. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a> : "In the days of Pekah king of Israel, came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah . . . and <span class= "ital">Gilead,</span> and Galilee . . . and carried them captive to Assyria.") From the Assyrian records we learn that (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> 734?732 B.C.) Tiglath-pileser received the homage of Ahaz (Yahu-haci, Jeho-ahaz), king of Judah, slew Rezin (Racunni) of Damascus, and reduced Pekah (Paqah�), king of Samaria, to vassalage. This supplements the Biblical account. Gilead, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>, represents the trans-Jordanic tribes. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-10.htm" title="And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelled in their tents throughout all the east land of Gilead.">1Chronicles 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-16.htm" title="And they dwelled in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, on their borders.">1Chronicles 5:16</a> above.) The transportation of entire populations was a common practice with the Assyrian kings. Assurbanipal (Sardanapalus) removed the men of Karbit from the mountains east of Assyria, and settled them in Egypt.<p><span class= "bld">Brought them unto Halah, and Habor . . .</span>--The same localities are mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a>) as those to which Shalmaneser IV., or rather his successor Sargon, transported the other tribes of the northern kingdom (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> 721 B.C.). There is nothing unlikely in the statement of either text. Sargon might have thought fit to strengthen the Israelite settlements in Northern Assyria by sending thither the new bodies of compulsory colonists. It is arbitrary to suppose that two different events have been confounded by the sacred annalists.<p><span class= "bld">Halah.</span>--See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Habor.</span>--Probably a district of North Assyria, not far from Halah, named after the river <span class= "ital">Hab?r</span> which rises near the upper <span class= "ital">Zab</span> and falls into the Tigris.<p><span class= "bld">Hara.</span>--Kings, <span class= "ital">l.c.,</span> "cities of Media."

These two were chosen ministers of God's will, if not ministers of himself. We can identify the date of this punishment which befell the transgressing Israelites east of the Jordan. The visit of the former, in the reign of Menahem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-15.htm">2 Kings 15:15-20</a>), may be interpreted and might have operated as a lesson and a warning. He was bought off with a thousand talents of silver. It seems to be said with significance," So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land." It was in the reign of Pekah, the usurping successor of Menahem's son Pekahiah, that the completer punishment fell, and Tilgath-pilneser effected the captivity spoken of here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27-29</a>. The name <span class="accented">Pul</span> cannot, it would appear, be a pure Assyrian name, and there is reason to think it may be identified with <span class="accented">Vul-lush</span> (grandson of the Shalmaneser who warred with Benhadad, etc.), a name found on Assyrian monuments, and belonging to a king who reigned at Calah, <span class="date">B.C. 8004750</span> (see art. "Pul," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). <span class="accented">Tilqath-pilneser</span> (see notes on ver. 6) was probably the founder of the lower dynasty of Assyria, and first king of the new empire. His first invasion was one chiefly of Israel and Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). His second was of a much more significant character. Called in to aid Judah under Ahaz against Pekah of Israel and Rezin of Syria in alliance, he both conquered these latter and brought into vassalage Judah itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Halah; Habor Hara; Gozan</span>. This enumeration exceeds that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a> by the addition of <span class="accented">Hara</span>, important as helping with consistent witness to the antiquity of the region described. <span class="accented">Halah</span> (<span class="accented">not</span> the "Calah" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>) is believed to be identifiable with <span class="accented">Chalcitis</span>, its verbal resemblance to which comes out a little more evidently in its Hebrew form (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>). A trace of it possibly remains in the name of a hill, <span class="accented">Gla</span>, on the <span class="accented">Khabour</span>, <span class="accented">i.q. Habor</span> of this passage, an important tributary of the Euphrates, and not the "Chebar" of Ezekiel. This name <span class="accented">Khabour</span> is found in an Assyrian inscription dating upwards of eight centuries before Christ. The mention of Habor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a> and 2 Kings 18:11 is, in the Authorized Version, made to convey the impression of a place "by" the "river of Gozan," instead of being, what the Hebrew says, "the river of Gozan." Here, on the other hand, <span class="accented">Gozan</span> is, in the Authorized Version, incorrectly translated as a river itself, instead of the region of a river. It is, according to the testimony of Layard ('Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 270-312), a remarkably fertile tract, being the <span class="accented">Gauzanitis</span> of Ptolemy, and substantially the Mygdonia of Polybius and Strabo. <span class="accented">Hara</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, with little doubt, the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">Haran</span>, or <span class="accented">Charran</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>), the ancient adopted home of Abraham, in Padan-aram, in Mesopotamia, on the Belik, a small tributary of the Euphrates. It is the Greek <span class="accented">Carrhae</span> of Strabo and Polybius. These four names purport to give us, probably in brief, the information that those of the Captivity here alluded to were divided - some to settle at Halab on one river, some in Hara on another, and the rest in the district called <span class="accented">Gauzanitis.</span> The region called Halah and that called Gau-zanitis, however, were both watered by the Khabour, and therefore the insertion of the name Haran where it is inserted occasions some difficulty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-26 Genealogies. - This chapter gives some account of the two tribes and a half seated on the east side of Jordan. They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.</body></html>
