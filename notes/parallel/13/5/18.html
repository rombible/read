The date is not given.<p>(18) <span class= "bld">Of valiant men.</span>--"<span class= "ital">All</span> <span class= "ital">that were valiant men, bearing shield and sword, and drawing bow, and-trained in warfare, were</span> 44,760, <span class= "ital">going out in the host"</span> Comp. what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm" title="And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes on the mountains;">1Chronicles 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-21.htm" title="And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host.">1Chronicles 12:21</a>, of the Gadites and Manassites, who joined fortunes with David. The number of the warriors of the three tribes nearly corresponds to the number (40,000) assigned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm" title="About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.">Joshua 4:13</a>. It evidently rests upon some official census, of which the chronicler had the record or among his authorities. The data of the Pentateuch (Numbers 1, 26) are quite different,<p>(19) <span class= "bld">Hagarites.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-10.htm" title="And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelled in their tents throughout all the east land of Gilead.">1Chronicles 5:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.</span>--In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-31.htm" title="Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. These are the sons of Ishmael.">1Chronicles 1:31</a>, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah are the last three of the twelve tribes of Ishmael. As <span class= "ital">Nodab</span> is mentioned nowhere else, the word may be a corruption of Kedemah, or rather Kedem. The first two letters might have been mistaken for <span class= "ital">h,</span> the <span class= "ital">d</span> is common to both words, and <span class= "ital">b</span> and <span class= "ital">m</span> are often confused in Hebrew writing. Jetur is the original of the classical name Ituraea, the modern <span class= "ital">El-Jedur.</span><p>(20) <span class= "bld">And they were helped against them.</span>--The same word recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-26.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.">1Chronicles 15:26</a> : "And when God helped the Levites that bare the Ark." In both places strictly natural events are regarded as providential. Here the Divine hand is recognised as controlling the issues of an invasion; there as permitting the Ark to be successfully removed from its temporary resting place.<p><span class= "bld">For they cried to God in the battle.</span>--No doubt the Arab warriors also cried to their gods in the fierce struggle for life; and their faith, such as it was, gave them strength for the battle. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/18-3.htm" title="I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.">Psalm 18:3-6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-41.htm" title="They cried, but there was none to save them: even to the LORD, but he answered them not.">Psalm 18:41</a>.) The whole sentence to the end of the verse looks like a reason added to the narrative by the chronicler himself.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">And they took away their cattle.</span>--The numbers are large, but not at all incredible. Flocks and herds naturally constituted the chief wealth of these nomade tribes. Comp. the annual tribute in kind paid by Mesha, king of Moab, to Ahab of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm" title="And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.">2Kings 3:4</a>): "a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams in fleeces."<p><span class= "bld">Sheep.</span>--The Heb. word denotes both sheep and goats; <span class= "ital">pecora.</span><p><span class= "bld">Of men an hundred thousand.</span>--<span class= "ital">And persons </span>(<span class= "ital">soul of man,</span> a collective expression) <span class= "ital">a hundred thousand.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/31-32.htm" title="And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,">Numbers 31:32-35</a> the booty taken from Midian is far greater, but only 32,000 virgins were saved from the general slaughter of the vanquished. The number here may be corrupt, but we do not know enough about the numerical strength of the Arabian peoples to be able to decide. The captives would be valuable as slaves. Sennacherib boasts that he took 200,150 persons "small and great, male and female," from the cities of Judah.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">There fell down many slain.</span>--Hence the richness of the plunder. The warriors of the <span class= "bld">Arabian</span> allies were probably exterminated.<p><span class= "bld">The war was</span> <span class= "bld">of God.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-20.htm" title="But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.">2Chronicles 25:20</a>. This accounts for the completeness of the <span class= "bld">Arabian</span> overthrow. It is a human instinct to see tokens of Divine activity in great national catastrophes, as well as in the more awful phenomena of nature. In prophetic language, a "day of the Lord" had overtaken the sons of Hagar and their kindred.<p><span class= "bld">And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.</span>--When they were carried away to Assyria by Tiglath-Pileser, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-6.htm" title="Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.">1Chronicles 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm" title="And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.">1Chronicles 5:26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-22.</span> - These verses appear to be the fuller development of the war in Saul's time, mentioned in ver. 10 - the account apparently there delayed till the genealogy of the tribe of Gad had been given, and which still seems premature till the contents of vers. 23 and 24 should have been given. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-26 Genealogies. - This chapter gives some account of the two tribes and a half seated on the east side of Jordan. They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.</body></html>
