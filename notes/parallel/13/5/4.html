The line of Joel is traced through seven generations to Beerah, who was transported to Assyria by Tiglath Pileser. II., 734 B.C., in the reign of Pekah, king of Israel. Supposing there are no gaps in the series, Joel flourished 280 years (7 x 40) before that date; that is, about 1014 B.C., under David and Solomon.<p>(4) The LXX. read: "Sons of Joel Shemaiah, and Banaia (Benaiah) his son; and sons of Gog, son of Shemaiah, his son Micah," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - From which of the four sons of Reuben the line came in which Joel would appear, we do not know. Juntas and Tremellius say Hanoch, others Carmi, while the Syriac Version has Carrot <span class="accented">vice</span> Joel. It is to be remarked that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-8.htm">Numbers 26:8-10</a> a line of descent through <span class="accented">Pallu</span> is given, but reaching only to the second generation, <span class="cmt_word">Beerah</span> in the present list will be only ninth at furthest from Reuben, so that it is evident that it is a very fragmentary genealogy, whether the hiatus be only one, viz. between Reuben's son (whichever it may be in question) and Joel, or whether both there and elsewhere also. Of none of the eight persons beginning with Joel and ending with Beerah is anything else known, unless either <span class="cmt_word">Shemaiah</span> or <span class="cmt_word">Shimei</span> may be identical with the Shema of ver. 8, in which case it might be also that the Joel of ver. 8 is identical with that of ver. 4. In this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a> <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span> appears as the name of a <span class="accented">man.</span> In this passage, and in ver. 26 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20</a>, we have a different form in each part of the word, of the <span class="accented">Tiglath-pileser</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>. These slight differences in the position of the radicals, with the introduction or omission of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, make as many as four different readings in the Hebrew. Tiglath-pileser, the second Assyrian king who came into conflict with the Israelites, reigned <span class="accented">about</span> <span class="date">B.C. 747-727</span>. Gesenius thinks that the former half of the word is the same as <span class="accented">Diglath</span>, i.q. Tigris; and that the latter, a root occurring also in the name <span class="accented">Nabo-pola-saris</span>, is from an Assyrian verb meaning "to guard." He translates the word as "Lord of the Tigris." The Assyrian reproduction of the name is <span class="accented">Tigulti-pal-tsira</span> (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'), or <span class="accented">Tukulti-pal-zara</span> ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The Captivity is spoken of further in the last verse of this chapter and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27-31</a>. The Septuagint reads vers. 4 and 5 differently: "The sons of Joel, Semei and Banaea his son; and the sons of Gog the son of <span class="accented">Semei</span>," etc., and this in all three editions - Vatican, Alexandrine, and Aldine. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-26 Genealogies. - This chapter gives some account of the two tribes and a half seated on the east side of Jordan. They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.</body></html>
