This quite tallies with the fact that there were two <span class="accented">chronicles</span>, one for each division of the nation, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the chronicles of the kings of Judah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-6.htm">2 Kings 15:6</a>) and "the chronicles of the kings of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-11.htm">2 Kings 15:11</a>), in which same chapter both Jeroboam (II.) of Israel and Jotham of Judah are spoken of, the latter beginning to reign in Judah some twenty years (the exact chronology is very confused here) after the death of the former. Although presumably it would be an object of closer interest with Israel than with Judah to effect the registration of the Gadite genealogy, yet it was most just that Judah should do so as well. This would both vindicate Judah's own right place and be a happy omen of the continued predominance of her position compared with that of Israel. Independently of the question of <span class="accented">effecting</span> the actual registration, however, it is quite possible that, so long as history ran by the side of history. Israel would gather and keep all it could of Judah, and Judah all it could of Israel. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-26 Genealogies. - This chapter gives some account of the two tribes and a half seated on the east side of Jordan. They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.</body></html>
