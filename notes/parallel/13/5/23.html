Machir evidently was <span class="accented">spes gregis</span> (though apparently not the only son, for see <span class="accented">Asriel</span>, or <span class="accented">Ashriel</span>, in above references), and is repeatedly mentioned with his sou Gilead. It is probable that the division of the tribe was determined partly according to the energy of those who composed it at the time of division - the more warlike being more adapted to the east of Jordan. Nevertheless Machir is distinctly mentioned westward, as well as with Gilead eastward (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29-31</a>). (For the further prosecution of this part of the subject, see Exposition, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baal-hermon</span>, etc. These three names need scarcely be read as different names for exactly the same region, but as designating different sides or heights of what was essentially one and the same well-known mountain district, with which would agree Psalm 43:6, "Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and <span class="accented">of the Hermonites</span>, from the hill Mizar.' So <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8-10</a> tells us that Hermon was called <span class="accented">Sirion</span> by the Sidonians; Shenir, <span class="accented">i.q. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Senir</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, exactly the same word in the Hebrew text in all the four places of its occurrence - <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>), by the Amorites. And the suggestion of Grove is likely enough, that <span class="accented">Baal-hermon</span> was the Phoenician cast of the name. If any point were to be gained by reading the names, however, as intended to cover exactly the same tract, it may be noted <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Hebrew conjunction will perfectly admit of being translated "even;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the <span class="accented">order</span> of the names, going from the foreign to the native <span class="cmt_word">Hermon</span> itself, would so far favour it. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>5:1-26 Genealogies. - This chapter gives some account of the two tribes and a half seated on the east side of Jordan. They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for destruction.</body></html>
