The Hebrew of our text may be a corruption or intentional alteration of this. The word for "clothed" is the Aramaic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-21.htm" title="Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.">Daniel 3:21</a>, <span class= "ital">m?kurb?l</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> which might easily be, by inadvertence or design, substituted for the rare word <span class= "ital">m?kark?r</span> (Sam.), "dancing."<p><span class= "bld">A robe of fine linen.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a me'il of byssus.</span> The <span class= "ital">me'il</span> was an upper garment worn by persons of rank (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-18.htm" title="And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?">2Samuel 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-27.htm" title="And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold on the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.">1Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-14.htm" title="I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.">Job 29:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And all the Levites . . . and the singers, and Chenaniah.</span>--<span class= "ital">Scil.,</span> were clothed with <span class= "ital">a me'il of byssus.</span><p><span class= "bld">The master of the song.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the chief</span> (overseer) <span class= "ital">of the bearing.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-22.htm" title="And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.">1Chronicles 15:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">With the singers.</span>--Omit, as an accidental repetition. The word "with" is wanting in the Hebrew, which is ungrammatical as it stands. The entire clause, "and all the Levites . . . with the singers," is not read in the parallel account.<p><span class= "bld">David also had upon him an ephod of linen.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and upon David</span> (was) <span class= "ital">an ephod of linen.</span> (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2Samuel 6:14</a>.) The ephod, a sort of cope, was distinctive of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-18.htm" title="And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.">1Samuel 22:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - Several things in this verse indicate a somewhat uncertain and unsteady selection of particulars by the compiler from his original sources. The natural reading of the verse would seem to say that <span class="cmt_word">David and all those Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah,</span> all wore <span class="cmt_word">the robe of byssus,</span> while David had, in addition<span class="cmt_word">, the ephod of linen</span>. Yet it is unlikely that all did wear the robe. Again, the Hebrew text exhibits no preposition before the <span class="cmt_word">singers</span>, on the second occasion of the occurrence of the expression in this verse. Yet little sense can be found without a preposition. The robe was not distinctively a priest's garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-18.htm">2 Samuel 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>), though priests did wear it. The robe of byssus is spoken of only here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>. <span class="accented">Byssus</span>, however, is spoken of as material for other purposes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-21.htm">1 Chronicles 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>. The <span class="accented">ephod</span>, on the other hand, was no doubt distinctively a high priest's garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4-12</a>), though we read of Samuel wearing one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18, 28</a>), and of David doing the same, as on this occasion. The fine linen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span>), in the first clause of this verse, is not the same with that (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span>) in the last clause. The first clause of this verse (which makes the last clause somewhat redundant) bears some resemblance in letters to the <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a> <span class="bible_ref">fourteenth verse</span> of 2 Samuel 6. first clause, which means, "and David danced with all his might," and the two clauses exactly answer to one another in position - another suggestion of an uncertain text here. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:25-29 It is good to notice the assistance of Divine Providence, even in things which fall within the compass of our natural powers; if God did not help us, we could not stir a step. If we do our religious duties in any degree aright, we must own it was God that helped us; had we been left to ourselves, we should have been guilty of some fatal errors. And every thing in which we engage, must be done in dependence on the mercy of God through the sacrifice of the Redeemer.</body></html>
