They also direct fresh attention to the sources upon which they drew. The history of the preparations made for the reception of the ark, and for its safe and religious escort into the city, is now proceeded with. These preparations occupied the three months, or part of the three months, spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>. The <span class="cmt_word">houses</span> may have been both his own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>) and the buildings referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>. The old tent, or <span class="accented">tabernacle</span>, is repeatedly alluded to, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>. It will be remembered that the tabernacle established by Joshua at Shiloh remained there till the time of Eli, and the ark within it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>). Afterwards we find it removed to Nob, for there David ate the shewbread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>). From thence, very possibly after the savage slaughter of the priests by the order of Saul, it was removed, and we find it at Gibeon, according to the above references. Here at Gibeon was an altar and "high place," which, in the earlier time of Solomon, formed the chief religious centre. The wanderings of the ark already given from Shiloh, through Philistia to Beth-she-mesh, Kirjath-jearim, Perez-uzzah, now land it in this tent in Jerusalem. It is no more sheltered in the tabernacle. But the tabernacle, as well as the ark, was ultimately brought to the new-built temple of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-4.htm">2 Chronicles 1:4</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-24 Wise and good men may be guilty of oversights, which they will correct, as soon as they are aware of them. David does not try to justify what had been done amiss, nor to lay the blame on others; but he owns himself guilty, with others, of not seeking God in due order</body></html>
