God had been adverse to those who conducted the Ark on the former occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-9.htm" title="And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.">1Chronicles 13:9</a>), as was inferred from the sudden death of Uzza. Now, when the Levites had undertaken the work in due order, and no harm had befallen, it was understood that the Divine goodwill was with the enterprise. That they had borne the holy Ark six paces without any sign of wrath was enough to call forth the grateful offerings of hearts relieved from a dread which only ceased to haunt them when the event proved it to be groundless. Our text, more exact than Samuel, gives the number and kind of the victims then sacrificed. Others refer the two accounts to different sacrifices, taking Samuel to mean that at every six paces a bullock and a fat sheep were slain by priests stationed all along the course, while they suppose our text to refer to a final sacrifice, offered when the Ark had reached its destination. This solution of the difficulty appears incredible, especially as regards the supposition of priests not mentioned in the narrative. Another view understands our text in this sense, but makes the offering in Samuel an initial sacrifice of consecration. But it is not likely that the two sacrifices are really different: (1) because the narrative here is generally parallel with Samuel; and (2) the chronicler may have intentionally paraphrased the older text for the sake of explanation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-1.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.">Numbers 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-29.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.">Numbers 23:29</a> for the sacrifice.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - This verse with the following four are paralleled by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-16</a> The contents of this verse in particular reveal the intense anxiety and the trembling fear and awe with which the sacred burden was now again lifted. A world of meaning and of feeling for all those present at least underlay the expression, <span class="cmt_word">When God helped the Levites that bare the ark</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-14.htm">1 Samuel 6:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-13.htm">2 Samuel 6:13, 18</a>). The offering of <span class="cmt_word">seven bullocks and seven rams</span> is thought by some to he additional to David's offering, when he had gone "six paces" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-13.htm">2 Samuel 6:13</a>). Much more probably, however, the "six paces" meant, not six footsteps, but six lengths that would make some distance. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:25-29 It is good to notice the assistance of Divine Providence, even in things which fall within the compass of our natural powers; if God did not help us, we could not stir a step. If we do our religious duties in any degree aright, we must own it was God that helped us; had we been left to ourselves, we should have been guilty of some fatal errors. And every thing in which we engage, must be done in dependence on the mercy of God through the sacrifice of the Redeemer.</body></html>
