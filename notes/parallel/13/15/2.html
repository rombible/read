And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.">1Chronicles 13:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites.</span>--See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/4-5.htm" title="And when the camp sets forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering veil, and cover the ark of testimony with it:">Numbers 4:5-15</a>, where the Kohathite Levites are appointed to carry the Ark and other sacred objects; and the more definite <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a> : "At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day." David's enunciation of the law is a tacit acknowledgment that on the former occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/13-7.htm" title="And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.">1Chronicles 13:7-10</a>) it had not been observed. That the Ark was now duly carried by bearers is expressly stated in the older account (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-13.htm" title="And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatted calves.">2Samuel 6:13</a>), though their being Levites is not noticed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This verse together with vers. 12-15 show that the severe lesson of the destruction of Uzzah had been laid to heart, and had made David supremely anxious to take better counsel of the Law. Uzzah, though possibly the son of a Levite, more probably of a Hivite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7, 17</a>), was not a priest, nor is there any sufficient evidence that he was a Levite; and most distinct was the order of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-51.htm">Numbers 1:51-53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-29.htm">Numbers 3:29-32</a>; 4:15420), that "when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death." So the sons of Kohath are to come to bear the sanctuary with all its sacred vessels, "but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die." Many things were allowed to be carried on waggons under the charge of the Gershonites and Merarites, but the strict contents of the sanctuary were to be borne in a specified manner by the Kohathites. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-24 Wise and good men may be guilty of oversights, which they will correct, as soon as they are aware of them. David does not try to justify what had been done amiss, nor to lay the blame on others; but he owns himself guilty, with others, of not seeking God in due order</body></html>
