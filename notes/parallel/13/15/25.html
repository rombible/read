The preparations for the ceremony are now complete, and the procession starts. A slight change in the Hebrew (omission of the article; so Syriac and one MS. of LXX.) will improve the sense: "And it came to pass, David and the elders . . . were walking to bring up the Ark."<p><span class= "bld">To bring up the ark.</span>--<span class= "bld">"</span>Into the city of David" (Samuel).<p><span class= "bld">The ark of the covenant of the Lord.</span>--A special title of the Ark, which has not occurred before in this history. It is not read in the parallel passage of Samuel, where we find only "ark of God," and "ark of <span class= "ital">Jehovah."</span> The phrase may therefore indicate that the chronicler had another source besides that book. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-3.htm" title="And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place, and go after it.">Joshua 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-17.htm" title="And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.">Joshua 3:17</a>.) The parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm" title="And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.">2Samuel 6:12</a>) makes no mention of <span class= "ital">"</span>the elders and captains," but merely states in brief and somewhat abrupt fashion that David went and brought up the Ark, because he had heard of its bringing a blessing upon the house of Obed-edom.<p><span class= "bld">With joy.</span>--With set rejoicings and festal mirth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:25-29 It is good to notice the assistance of Divine Providence, even in things which fall within the compass of our natural powers; if God did not help us, we could not stir a step. If we do our religious duties in any degree aright, we must own it was God that helped us; had we been left to ourselves, we should have been guilty of some fatal errors. And every thing in which we engage, must be done in dependence on the mercy of God through the sacrifice of the Redeemer.</body></html>
