These trumpets were of solid silver, of one piece, were straight and narrow, and had an expanded mouth. They are found on the arch of Titus, and are described by Josephus. On the other hand, the trumpet, more correctly rendered "cornet" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, as distinguished from our <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which was used for proclaiming the jubilee, for announcing the new year for sentinel and other special signals, and for war, was shaped like a ram's horn, and probably made of the same. The particular appropriateness of the use of the former on this occasion is manifest, in addition to the fact that they were the appointed trumpets for the journeying of the camp and <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> of the ark itself at a time so essentially religious as the present. Yet, as we learn from ver. 28, the latter were used as well, and <span class="accented">cymbals</span>, <span class="accented">psalteries</span>, and <span class="accented">harps. The</span> original number of the silver trumpets was two only, and they were to be sounded strictly by the anointed priests, sons of Aaron, at all events when their employment was within the sanctuary. Their employment, however, grew far more general, and we find (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>) that their number had risen to a hundred and twenty (so too <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>).
