There were four Kohathite houses to one of Merari and Gershom, because the sub-tribe of Kohath was the elder house, and had special charge of the Ark and other most holy vessels of the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-4.htm" title="This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:">Numbers 4:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-11.</span> - This classification of the <span class="cmt_word">children of Aaron</span>, as the special priests, and of the <span class="cmt_word">Levites</span>, is constantly observed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-26.htm">1 Chronicles 12:26, 27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-17.htm">1 Chronicles 27:17</a>). The mention of the six representative Levitical families follows. That of <span class="cmt_word">Kohath</span> (ver. 5) takes the lead, because, though second in order of birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1-30</a>), its priestly importance gave it always first rank. To the same head belonged also three of the remaining five families, viz. <span class="cmt_word">Hebron</span> (ver. 9) and <span class="cmt_word">Uzziel</span> (ver. 10), who were brothers, as being beth sons of Kohath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>); and <span class="cmt_word">Elizaphan</span>, who, though son of Uzziel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-22.htm">Exodus 6:22</a>), had come to represent a distinct family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-30.htm">Numbers 3:30</a>). The other two required to complete the six are <span class="cmt_word">Asaiah</span> (ver. 6) of the house of Merari, and <span class="cmt_word">Joel</span> (ver. 7) of the house of Gershom. The representatives, then, of these six families, with the company of the brethren belonging to each of them, and the two priests <span class="cmt_word">Zadok</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Abiathar</span> (ver. 11), are now summoned into the presence of David, to receive a short but special charge. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>15:1-24 Wise and good men may be guilty of oversights, which they will correct, as soon as they are aware of them.
