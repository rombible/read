Recapitulation of the Levitical classes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/24-20.htm" title="And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.">1Chronicles 24:20-31</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/23-12.htm" title="The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.">1Chronicles 23:12-23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The order has been thus given of the twenty-four classes or courses of the priests. Each course served a week from the seventh day to the seventh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>). An interesting allusion to this order of courses is tacitly made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16-18</a>, where the twenty-fifth idolater may be supposed to be the high priest. Some have, on very insufficient grounds, supposed that this "ordering" of courses was not really the institution of David, but attributed to him after the Exile for the sake of the authority of his name. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a>, moreover, the names do not appear as even twenty-four, but twenty-two - deficient by two! - a thing most easily to be accounted for. In addition to the direct scriptural witness on this subject, Josephus's ('Ant.,' 7:14) testimony confirms the account of our present chapter, while Movers (in 'Chronik.,' 279) and Dehler (in Herzog's 'R.E.,' 12:185) effectively combat the positions of De Wette and Gramberg, and of Herzberg, in his 'History of the People of Israel.' <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-31 The divisions of the priests and Levites. - When every one has, knows, and keeps his place and work, the more there are the better. In the mystical body of Christ, every member has its use, for the good of the whole. Christ is High Priest over the house of God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection. In Christ, no difference is made between bond and free, elder and younger. The younger brethren, if faithful and sincere, shall be no less acceptable to Christ than the fathers. May we all be children of the Lord, fitted to sing his praises for ever in his temple above.</body></html>
