The chronicler naturally returned to them after his account of the priestly classes. Hence, perhaps, the omission of the Gershonite houses is intentional. The narrative proceeds to treat of the Levites who were not in immediate attendance on the priesthood in 1 Chronicles 25, 26<p><span class= "bld">The chief of the fathers.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the chiefs of the clans.</span><p><span class= "bld">Even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">clans</span>--<span class= "ital">the chief just like his younger brother.</span> The word "fathers" (<span class= "ital">?both</span>) is a brief form of "father-houses" (<span class= "ital">beth- ?both</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The meaning appears to be that all the Levitical houses received their position by lot, senior and junior branches alike. The order, as thus determined, is not communicated; nor is it expressly stated that the Levitical classes were twenty-four in number, but it appears highly probable, both from the data of the text, and from the analogy of the classes of the priests and the musicians (1 Chronicles 25).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Over against... over against</span>. This translation of the Hebrew (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) is obscure and awkward. The meaning is "equally with," or "correspondingly with" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">1 Chronicles 26:12, 16</a>, etc.). The root means "communion," and the word is found only in the constructive state.

In the mystical body of Christ, every member has its use, for the good of the whole. Christ is High Priest over the house of God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection. In Christ, no difference is made between bond and free, elder and younger. The younger brethren, if faithful and sincere, shall be no less acceptable to Christ than the fathers. May we all be children of the Lord, fitted to sing his praises for ever in his temple above.</body></html>
