So one Hebrew MS. The LXX. has, "one by one for Eleazar, and one by one for Ithamar." (So some Hebrew MSS. The Syriac and Vulg. read, "one house for Eleazar, and another house for Ithamar.") The chances would be that the Ithamarites would all be drawn before the Eleazarites. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/25-22.htm" title="The fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brothers, were twelve:">1Chronicles 25:22-31</a>, where ten "sons of the Hemanite" are left over, and drawn last.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The person who acted as clerk or secretary on the occasion, and the whole number of the witnesses, and the lot-taking itself, are here given. The present Hebrew text repeats the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5d6;</span> (taken) twice, before the name of Ithamar, at the end of the sentence. The evident and easy correction of the first occurrence of which into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> (one) will make the clause and sense correspond with what goes before. Bertheau, however, and Keil, and some others do not accept this correction, and would keep the present Hebrew text, the first-named, moreover, contending that the repetition of the word for "taking" points to two lots being represented by each house of Ithamar, whose total number was only eight, for one of Eleazar, whose total was sixteen. Not only does the repetition of the present Hebrew text not avail to authorize such a supposition, but the supposition itself would be unsupported and gratuitous. What is really told us amounts to this only, that the drawing was first from the collection of families under the name of Eleazar, and then from that descended from Ithamar. For anything we are here told, the urn of Ithamar can have held out only half as long as that of Eleazar, and it can be only conjecture to suppose that two lots were drawn from the urn of Eleazar for every one from that of Ithamar, so as to make them run out together at the end. Could any one of the names from sixteen to twenty-four that are recorded in this chapter as "coming forth" in the shape of a "lot," be identified as belonging to families descended from Ithamar, the question might be solved. <span class="cmt_word">Ahimelech the son of Abiathar</span>; read, as above, ver. 3, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>, etc., <span class="accented">Abiathar the son of Abimelech.</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-31 The divisions of the priests and Levites. - When every one has, knows, and keeps his place and work, the more there are the better.
