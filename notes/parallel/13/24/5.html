"Princes of the sanctuary" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm" title="Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.">Isaiah 43:28</a>)--the phrase is equivalent to "princes of the priests" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm" title="Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 36:14</a>). "Princes of God"--an expression (<span class= "ital">s?re '?lohim</span>) not found elsewhere; it is either synonymous with the last, or perhaps denotes the high priests. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-4.htm" title="Eleazar begat Phinehas, Phinehas begat Abishua,">1Chronicles 6:4-6</a>.) The term "Prince of God" (<span class= "ital">n?si '?lohim</span>) is applied to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-6.htm" title="Hear us, my lord: you are a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury your dead; none of us shall withhold from you his sepulcher, but that you may bury your dead.">Genesis 23:6</a>), apparently in the sense of <span class= "ital">mighty prince,</span> which may be the meaning here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Translate, <span class="cmt_word">And they divided them by lots, these with those</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. as</span> there was no ground of choice between the two families, which differed only in number, and as the highest ecclesiastical places had been filled already by both of them, the impartiality of the "lot" was resorted to, for the settling of the order in which they would take the services now in question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a>). The <span class="cmt_word">governors</span>; read rather, <span class="accented">the princes.</span> The distinction intended between "the holy princes," or "princes of the sanctuary," on the one hand, and "the princes of God" on the other, is not very clear. One instance of the former expression is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>. Keil supposes there may be no distinction between them, but adds that if there is, he would take the "princes of God" to stand for the regular high priests exclusively, viz. those who could enter into the most holy place before God. The "princes of God" is a title evidently illustrated by the word "Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>24:1-31 The divisions of the priests and Levites. - When every one has, knows, and keeps his place and work, the more there are the better.
