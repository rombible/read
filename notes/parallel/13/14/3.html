The concubines are not omitted because of offence, for they are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="These were all the sons of David, beside the sons of the concubines, and Tamar their sister.">1Chronicles 3:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David took more wives</span>. As matter of course, we do not look in this connection for any remarks to be made by the writer condemnatory of David's enlargement of the harem, or of his having an harem at all. Yet it is open to us to note how, at a time when polygamy was "winked at," and no sin was necessarily to lie on this account at the door of David, yet by this very thing he was undermining the peace and unity of his own family, the comfort of his declining years once and again, and the very stability of his house in the days of Solomon his son. The less necessitated we are to regard David's polygamy in the light of individual sin, the more emphatic in the light of history does the <span class="accented">tendency</span> of the practice proclaim itself as thoroughly and irredeemably bad. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-17 David's victories. - In this chapter we have an account of, 1.
