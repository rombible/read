Beside this Hiram or Huram, the king, there was another Hiram or Huram, the same king's chief artificer, and whom he sent to the help of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-11.htm">2 Chronicles 4:11, 16</a>). The willing aid which this king lent to David on this occasion, in supplying cedar timber and workmen, was "the commencement of that amity between the Tyriaus and the Hebrews, so mutually advantageous to the two nations, the one agricultural and the other commercial" (Milman's 'History of the Jews,' 1:239). The meaning of the name Hiram is probably "noble," or "highborn." This disposition, at all events, he seems to have illustrated in his generous friendship to David, Solomon, and their people.
