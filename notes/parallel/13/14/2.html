The passage in Samuel reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, the Piel conjugation. The present form is obscure, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span>. It may be considered either an irregular Niphal third pers. fem.; or Niphal infin, absolute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>); or possibly even an irregular Piel form, in which case the pronoun "he" will need to be supplied as the subject. Supposing that any special connection subsists between this and the previous verse, it is not necessary to consider it remote. Then, as now, the building of a house for one's self, much more the building of a noble palace on the part of a king, is an indication of feeling settled and "confirmed." It was a partial indication of the "lifted-up kingdom" that the king should have a palace of unwonted magnificence.
