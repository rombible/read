David was to listen for the wind rustling in the tops of the <span class= "ital">bacas--a</span> sound like that of walking on dead leaves--and then to make his attack. (But comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2Kings 7:6</a>.) But we are reminded, in connection with this fragment of David's history, that all ancient people attached a prophetic import to the motion and rustling of leaves. Omens from trees are mentioned in the table of contents of the great Assyrian work on terrestrial omens, compiled by order of Sargon of Agade or Accad (about 2200 B.C.). Comp. also the speaking oaks of Dodona, the laurel of Delos (Virg. <span class= "ital">'n.</span> iii. 91), and that of Delphi (<span class= "ital">Hymn to Apollo,</span> 393). The "oak of the diviners" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-37.htm" title="And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.">Judges 9:37</a>), and perhaps Deborah's palm-tree, and even the burning bush, must be referred to the same order of ideas. The Arabs believe the thorny bushes of the <span class= "ital">gharqad</span> capable of uttering prophetic words; and with them the <span class= "ital">sam-ra,</span> or Egyptian thorn, is sacred. These analogies, however, do not militate against the reality or the miraculous character of the Biblical occurrence. The Divine communications with man always assume the form best adapted for striking the mind amidst reigning ideas. Biblical visions, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> always have the colour of the seer's environment: those of Joseph are Egyptian; those of Ezekiel in the Exile, Assyrian. (See, further, Lenormant, <span class= "ital">La Divination en Chaldee</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Then thou shalt go out to battle.</span>--A paraphrase of the term used in Samuel.<p><span class= "bld">For God is gone forth.</span>--"Then" (Samuel), viz., "when thou hast heard the signal."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A sound of going</span>. This is net a mere generic or longer form of expression to signify a sound itself. There is significance in the word "going." The sense of the Hebrew word would be thrown out more emphatically by such a rendering as, <span class="accented">the sound of steps</span> (literally, <span class="accented">stepping</span>). When the motion of the agitated leaves simulated the sound of steps, the stepping of men, then David and his army were to step forth to battle. Though the root of the "stepping" spoken of as heard in the trees is not identical with that of the "going" repeated twice in the remainder of the verse - <span class="cmt_word">Then thou shalt go out... for God is gone forth</span> - yet it does alliterate to some extent with it, and rather creates the impression that it was intended to do so. However, the parallel place does not sustain this impression, inasmuch as a different word, "Thou shalt <span class="accented">bestir</span> thyself," is there employed, in place of the first occurrence of our supposed alliteration, in the clause, "Thou shalt go out." There is something stirring to the imagination, and probably it was felt so by David and his men, in the signal unseen yet not unheard, and in a sense not of earth, but midway between earth and heaven. The very various voices of the various trees, according to the character of their foliage, may well set poetry going, and startle or fascinate imagination, as the case may be. The music of one tree or grove is as different from that of another as can be - listen to the difference between the melancholy plaint so unceasing of some plantation of firs, and the multitudinous, silvery, rippling of but one white poplar of good size. Presumably the sound in the present ease more resembled that of the steady tramp of them that march. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-17 David's victories. - In this chapter we have an account of, 1. David's kingdom established. 2. His family built up. 3. His enemies defeated. This is repeated from 2Sa 5. Let the fame of David be looked upon as a type and figure of the exalted honour of the Son of David.</body></html>
