And David heard of it, and went out against them.">1Chronicles 14:8-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/5-17.htm" title="But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.">2Samuel 5:17-25</a>).<p>Although placed here after the account of the palace building, this invasion must have occurred earlier in the reign of David, and probably soon after the storming of Jerusalem, a proof of capacity, which would rouse the Philistines to combined action against the new sovereign of Israel. (Comp. 1 Samuel 13)<p>(8) <span class= "bld">David was anointed.</span>--Samuel, "they had anointed David." The verb in each case is <span class= "ital">mashah</span>, from which is derived <span class= "ital">Mash?ah</span>=<span class= "ital">Messiah</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Over all Israel.</span>--The word "all," omitted in Samuel, contrasts David's second election with his first as king of Judah only.<p><span class= "bld">To seek David.</span>--With hostile intent. The verb is so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-2.htm" title="Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.">1Samuel 26:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Went out against them.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">before them</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-17.htm" title="And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you: but if you be come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.">1Chronicles 12:17</a>). Samuel has, "went down to the stronghold." The term "stronghold" (<span class= "ital">m?c-d?h</span>) designates the "castle of Zion" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-5.htm" title="And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come here. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.">1Chronicles 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-7.htm" title="And David dwelled in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.">1Chronicles 11:7</a>), and also David's old refuge, the rock and cave of Adullam, in the valley of Elah. The latter is probably intended here. As on former occasions, the Philistine forces were likely to choose the route through the valley of Elah (co?np. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/18-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.">1Samuel 18:1-2</a>), and David "went down" from Zion "to meet them" there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-12.</span> - <span class="accented">An</span> <span class="accented">important victory over the Philistines.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David... went out against them</span>. From a careful comparison of this passage with the parallel and with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-12.htm">2 Samuel 23:12-14</a>, it appears likely that the meaning is that "David went out against them" after having "gone down" first to the "hold," probably at the "cave of Adullam" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-15.htm">1 Chronicles 11:15-17</a>). When it is said that the Philistines went up to seek David, the sequel makes it evident that they did not seek him as friends. And it is to be remembered that the Philistines held territory near Jerusalem at this time, and to the north of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-7.htm">1 Samuel 31:7-9</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>14:1-17 David's victories. - In this chapter we have an account of, 1.
