The phrase "forming line of battle," repeats the verb of </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.">1Chronicles 12:3</a>,<span class= "ital"> and supplies its proper object </span>('od?re ma'drakhah<span class= "ital">,</span> aciem struentes)<span class= "ital">. </span>The Hebrew indicates a stop at "line of battle;" it is better to put it after "with whole heart" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-33.htm" title="Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.">1Chronicles 12:33</a>). "They formed in line with fearless intrepidity;" literally, <span class= "ital">corde integro</span>.<p><span class= "bld">And all the rest also of Israel,</span> who did not appear personally at Hebron.--" The rest (<span class= "ital">sh?rith</span>) is a term used here only. The Hebrew says, "the remainder of Israel (was) one heart," i.e., was unanimous. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-12.htm" title="Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.">2Chronicles 30:12</a>.)<p>Allowing the average for Issachar, the total of the warriors assembled at Hebron was upwards of 300,000. This will not surprise us if we bear in mind that in those days every able-bodied man was, as a matter of course, trained in the use of arms, and liable to be called out for the king,s wars. Thus "man" and "warrior" were almost convertible terms. The present gathering was not a parade of the entire strength of the nation; co?np. the 600,000 warriors of the Exodus, and the 1,300,000 of David's census. The main difficulty--that of the relative proportions of the various tribal contingents--has been considered in the preceding Notes. The suggestions there made are, of course, uncertain, the fact being that we really do not know enough of the condition of the tribes at that epoch to justify us in pronouncing upon the relative probability of the numbers here assigned to them. That being so, it is a hasty and uncritical exaggeration to say that "it is absolutely inconceivable that the tribes near the place of meeting, notably that of Judah, should have furnised so small a contingent, while the figures are raised in direct proportion to the distance to be traversed" (Reuss).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:23-40 When the throne of Christ is set up in a soul, there is, or ought to be, great joy in that soul; and provision is made, not as here, for a few days, but for the whole life, and for eternity. Happy are those who wisely perceive it to be their duty and interest, to submit to the Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of David; who renounce for his sake all that is not consistent; whose earnest endeavours to do good are directed by the wisdom that God giveth, through acquaintance with his word, experience, and observation. If any man lack this wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.</body></html>
