The term for "God" (Elohim) has probably fallen out of the Heb. ext. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm" title="And the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said to them, Thus said God, Why transgress you the commandments of the LORD, that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.">2Chronicles 24:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Judges 6:34</a>.) We, in these days, may word it differently, and say, Under a sudden impulse of enthusiasm, Amasai exclaimed, &c. But if we look deeper, and seek a definite interpretation of our terms, we shall allow that the impulses of spirit are spiritual, and that enthusiasm for truth and right is indeed a sort of divine possession. The Syriac renders: "The spirit of valour clothed Amasai." Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>.) The spirit of Jehovah is the source of true courage, as of all other spiritual gifts.<p><span class= "bld">Amasai.</span>--Perhaps the same as Amasa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Abigail bore Amasa: and the father of Amasa was Jether the Ishmeelite.">1Chronicles 2:17</a>), son of Abigail, David's sister, whom Joab murdered out of jealousy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.">2Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/20-4.htm" title="Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be you here present.">2Samuel 20:4-10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Chief of the captains.</span>--The Heb. text reads, "head of the Thirty," with which the LXX., Svr., and Vulg. agree. The Heb. margin (Qri) has "knights," or "chariot-soldiers" (Authorised Version, "captains"), which is less probable. Amasai's name is not given in the catalogue of the Thirty (1 Chronicles 11), and he is here called "chief of the Thirty" by anticipation.<p><span class= "bld">Thine are we, David.</span>--The structure of Amasa?s inspired utterance is poetical--<p>"To thee, David!<p>And with thee, son of Ishai!<p>Peace, peace to thee.<p>And peace to thine helper;<p>For thy God hath holpen thee!<p><span class= "bld">On thy side.</span>--Heb., with thee. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm" title="These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.">1Chronicles 11:10</a>; and our Saviour's "He that is not with me is against me.")<p><span class= "bld">Peace, peace be unto thee.</span>--David had said, "If ye be come for peace"--that is, with friendly intent. Amasai answers, We will be fast friends with thee, and with all who befriend thee, because God is on thy side. (Comp, the usual Oriental greeting, Salam 'alaikum--Peace to you!) David's past history gave ample evidence of Divine support.<p><span class= "bld">Then David received them.</span>--A late Heb. word (qibb?l). The chronicler resumes his narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Made them captains of the band.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and bestowed them among the heads of the band</span>--made them officers of his little army, which was continually growing by such adhesions, (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm" title="And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.">1Samuel 22:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-13.htm" title="Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he declined to go forth.">1Samuel 23:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The response of the band, by the mouth of <span class="cmt_word">Amasai</span> was worthy of the character of the appeal that David made, both in its heartiness and its high tone. <span class="accented">Amasai.</span> Possibly the same with Amasa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>), the son of Abigail (David's sister), wife of Jether (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-13.htm">2 Samuel 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>). Ewald discusses this point ('Genesis Int.,' 2:544). He was made captain of the host by Absalom, afterwards by David, and Joab put an end to his life. <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-26.htm">Numbers 11:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-30.htm">Nehemiah 9:30</a>). The more literal translation of the verb <span class="cmt_word">came upon</span> is clothed. Most interesting and instructive is the subject of the gradually developing manifestation of the agency of the eternal Spirit from the beginning of the world. Through the ascending illustrations of his <span class="accented">natural</span> work in creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>), his relation to human <span class="accented">bodily</span> life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-3.htm">Job 27:3</a>), his intellectual work of various kinds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-3.htm">Exodus 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-29.htm">Judges 9:29</a>), we are led on to his highest spiritual functions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-22 Here is an account of those who appeared and acted as David's friends, while he was persecuted. No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.</body></html>
