David was still <span class= "ital">shut up</span> in his stronghold, or <span class= "ital">restrained</span> within bounds, <span class= "ital">because of, i.e.,</span> from dread of King Saul. Or perhaps the meaning is "banished from the presence of Saul."<p><span class= "bld">Helpers of the war.</span>--<span class= "ital">The helpers in war,</span> allies, or companions in arms of David. They made forays against Geshur, Gezer, and Amalek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm" title="And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.">1Samuel 27:8</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-17.htm" title="And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you: but if you be come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.">1Chronicles 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-21.htm" title="And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host.">1Chronicles 12:21</a> below).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Ziklag</span>. The occasion referred to is evidently that recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1, 2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1, 26</a>; and generally in those and the intermediate chapters. David stayed at Ziklag a year and four months, a period which closed for him with the death of Saul. Ziklag, in Joshus's original allotment, was the possession of Simeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-5.htm">Joshua 19:5</a>). It was situated south of Judah, and came into the hands of Judah when Achish made it a gift to David for a rest-deuce (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5-7</a>). The site of it has not been identified in later times. It witnessed one of the narrowest and most remarkable of the escapes of David, on an occasion which brought danger, not so much from acknowledged foes, as from the maddened grief and despair of his own friends and people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3-6</a>). The whole scene of the broken-hearted grief of David and his people, when, on discovering the successful raid of the Amalekites upon Ziklag, "they lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep," is one of the most dramatic on record. The rapid reverse to good fortune, when David turns away their heedless anger against himself and proposal to stone him, by pursuing and overcoming the enemy, and recovering their captives and their goods near the brook Besor, completes the effectiveness of the scene. The <span class="accented">middle voice</span> form of expression in this verse, kept himself close, means to say that David was, by fear of Saul and by force of his enemies, more or less hemmed up in Ziklag. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:1-22 Here is an account of those who appeared and acted as David's friends, while he was persecuted. No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.</body></html>
