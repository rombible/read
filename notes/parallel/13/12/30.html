The phrase "men of renown" is a natural addition to "valiant heroes," and need occasion no surprise. Doubtless their renown was collective. The comparative smallness of Ephraim's contingent is noticeable.

Happy are those who wisely perceive it to be their duty and interest, to submit to the Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of David; who renounce for his sake all that is not consistent; whose earnest endeavours to do good are directed by the wisdom that God giveth, through acquaintance with his word, experience, and observation. If any man lack this wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.</body></html>
