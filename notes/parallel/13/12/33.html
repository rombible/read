Nine MSS. read instead " helping " (<span class= "ital">la'z?r</span>), and the LXX. and Vulg. so translate. The Syriac has "to make war with those who disputed the sovranty of David." The phrase "falling into rank without a heart and a heart," asserts the unwavering fidelity and resolute courage of these warriors of Zebulun (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-3.htm" title="The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks proud things:">Psalm 12:3</a>, "a speech of smooth things with heart and heart they speak"; they think one thing and say another; are double-minded). The number of warriors assigned to Zebulun and Naphtali has been thought surprising, because these tribes "never played an important part in the history of Israel" (comp., however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-18.htm" title="Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that risked their lives to the death in the high places of the field.">Judges 5:18</a>).

If any man lack this wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.</body></html>
