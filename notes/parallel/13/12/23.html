The Syriac version omits the whole verse.<p><span class= "bld">And came to David.</span>--"And" is wanting in the Heb. "They came to David at Hebron," &c., is a parenthesis, unless the relative has fallen out.<p><span class= "bld">To turn the kingdom.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to bring it round</span> out of the direct line of natural heredity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-14.htm" title="And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.">1Chronicles 10:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">According to the word.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">mouth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-3.htm" title="Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.">1Chronicles 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm" title="These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.">1Chronicles 11:10</a>). What Jehovah had spoken by Samuel was virtually the word of his own mouth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The bands</span>; rather, the <span class="accented">chief men</span>, or <span class="accented">captains</span>, by one or the other of which words this same term has been several times hitherto rendered in the immediate context (yet see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-37.htm">Judges 9:37, 44</a>, and Judges 5:30 for yet a third signification). There follow (vers. 24-37) the numbers of each tribe (the full <span class="accented">thirteen</span> being enumerated) who "came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel." The large numbers of some of the joyful pilgrims to Hebron, as for instance of the trans-Jordanic tribes, the very small number that came of the tribe of Judah (in fact, lowest but one, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Benjamin, and yet nearest home), and of some others, help to invest with doubt the numerals of this passage, although it is not at all difficult to suggest some very passable explanations of these phenomena. This doubt is not lessened by the total, which, according to this list, must make a figure between three hundred and forty thousand and three hundred and fifty thousand men. To the host have to be added, as we are expressly told, the "asses, camels, mules, and oxen," which carried the "bread, meat, meal, cakes of figs and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance," for the consumption of the host during their "three days' "stay "with David," and their journeys to and fro. In the presence of such numbers, and the celebration of such an occasion, Hebron must indeed have beheld the reflection of its own probable meaning, of the "fellowship" or "community" of society. <span class="cmt_word">To turn the kingdom of Saul to him</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-14.htm">1 Chronicles 10:14</a>). The phrase is not a common one. <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord</span> (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-3.htm">1 Chronicles 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 12, 13</a>). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>12:23-40 When the throne of Christ is set up in a soul, there is, or ought to be, great joy in that soul; and provision is made, not as here, for a few days, but for the whole life, and for eternity. Happy are those who wisely perceive it to be their duty and interest, to submit to the Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of David; who renounce for his sake all that is not consistent; whose earnest endeavours to do good are directed by the wisdom that God giveth, through acquaintance with his word, experience, and observation. If any man lack this wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.</body></html>
