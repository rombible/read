There are three recognised headings to prophetical books--<span class= "ital">word, burden</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> oracle), and <span class= "ital">vision--</span>and all are used without the article, and in a general way, for the contents of the books, without any intention to distinguish between different kinds or modes of prophecy. Thus Nahum combines <span class= "ital">burden</span> and <span class= "ital">vision: "Burden</span> of Nineveh. Book of <span class= "ital">vision</span> of Nahum the Elkoshite." Amos speaks of the "<span class= "ital">words</span> which he <span class= "ital">saw</span>;" Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1</a>) of the "<span class= "ital">burden</span> which he did <span class= "ital">see</span>;' and Obadiah, after the word <span class= "ital">vision,</span> instantly proceeds, "Thus <span class= "ital">saith," &c.</span> The word <span class= "ital">vision</span> (Heb., <span class= "ital">chazon,</span> from the same verb as "seer"), appears, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm" title="And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.">1Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm" title="(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)">1Samuel 9:9</a>, to have acquired this general sense at a very early time. It is not necessary from the use of the word to suppose that the future was unfolded to Obadiah "in the form of sights spread out before his mind, . . . a succession of pictures which he may have seen" (Pusey). <span class= "ital">Vision</span> here = <span class= "ital">revelation,</span> however supplied. The question of authorship is discussed in the Excursus.<p><span class= "bld">Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom.--</span>After these words we should expect the words of the message, not the statement that a message had come. Among the attempts at explanation, the two most plausible are: (1) The two-fold heading is due to a later hand than Obadiah, who only prefixed the first part, "vision," &c., to his work; (2) These words are merely a mode of stating generally that the seer of the vision was divinely inspired. The view taken of the authorship and composition must decide between these two. If an earlier oracle is incorporated in the book, it is more natural to conclude that the second part of the double title, which in a slightly different form occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm" title="Concerning Edom, thus said the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?">Jeremiah 49:7</a>, was introduced in order to bring the prophecy into closer similarity to the circle of oracles against foreign nations which is contained in Jeremiah.<p><span class= "bld">Arise ye</span> . . .--Now at length we have the Divine message. Long ago, in the mysterious oracle of Dumah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm" title="The burden of Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?">Isaiah 21:11</a>), the foreboding of a pending chastisement of Seir found a voice, and now, as in consequence of a signal from heaven, or as if brought by an angel, goes forth the summons to the nations to begin the movement against Edom. The cup of iniquity was full. There is a suggestiveness even in the vagueness of the summons. The nations, without distinction of good or bad, must become the instruments of the Divine chastisement of overweening pride. Edom becomes the type of wickedness that has reached a head, and against which all the sounder elements of the world unite with God. For the full picture, here suggested only in a word, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1-17</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm" title="And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executes his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?">Joel 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm" title="Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.">Jeremiah 51:11</a>.<p>(2-9) Edom's pride and consequent humiliation. A general statement of the reason of the Divine wrath against Edom. Particular offences will be enumerated presently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/obadiah/1-10.htm" title="For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever.">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>).<p>(2) <span class= "bld">Small among the heathen.--</span>In comparison with the giant empires of Egypt and Assyria, a mere speck on the map. Edom proper is not to be confounded with the later kingdom of Idumaea, which extended over the wilderness of Et Tih, and even to within the southern borders of Palestine. The original Mount Seir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm" title="And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.">Genesis 32:3</a>), or, as our prophet calls it, Mount Esau, was a narrow tract of country on the east of Wady Arabah, extending from Elath to the brook Zered (probably the <span class= "ital">Wady-el-Ahsy;</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm" title="And when we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/2-13.htm" title="Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.">Deuteronomy 2:13-14</a>), about 100 miles in length, and nowhere more than twenty miles broad. One of the larger English counties would cover as much territory. In the corresponding passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-15.htm" title="For, see, I will make you small among the heathen, and despised among men.">Jeremiah 49:15</a>) our version has the future instead of the past, where also, instead of "greatly despised," is the reading, "despised among men." The past is better. The contrast between the size of the nation and its overbearing pride, created by the consciousness of the natural strength of its position, is lost if we give the verse a future sense.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">Clefts of the rock.--</span>The word <span class= "ital">chagavim,</span> clefts, is of doubtful derivation. It only occurs in the corresponding passage to this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-16.htm" title="Your terribleness has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, O you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, that hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:16</a>) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-14.htm" title="O my dove, that are in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see your countenance, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.">Song of Solomon 2:14</a>, and always with <span class= "ital">selah--</span>rock. But whether its etymological meaning be <span class= "ital">refuges</span> or <span class= "ital">fissures</span> does not matter, since the actual thing signified is still to be seen. The cliffs at Petra (Selah, or with the article, ha-Selah), the capital of Edom, and in its neighbourhood, are honeycombed with caves, natural or artificial, which from the earliest times to the present day have served as tombs for the dead, and temporary dwellings or shelters for the living. We read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-12.htm" title="The Horims also dwelled in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelled in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.">Deuteronomy 2:12</a> that the "Horims"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> troglodytes, or <span class= "ital">dwellers in caves</span>--were the original inhabitants of the land. "The whole southern country of the Edomites," says St. Jerome, "from Eleutheropolis to Petra and Selah (which are the possessions of Esau), had minute dwellings (<span class= "ital">habitatiunculas</span>) in caves; and on account of the oppressive heat of the sun, as being a southern province, had underground cottages." All more recent travellers confirm this. Robinson (ii. 529) speaks of "an innumerable multitude of excavations along the whole coast of perpendicular rocks adjacent to the main area, and in all the lateral valleys and chasms." But those at present existing are but a remnant of the vast number which must at one time have afforded shelter to the densely populated valleys. "What remains are the mere <span class= "ital">debris</span> of what the precipices once presented to view . . . The conduits, cisterns, flights of steps scattered over the rocks and among the precipices, indicate a larger number of rock-dwellings than remain now, very great as that number is" (Miss Martineau, <span class= "ital">Eastern Life, iii.</span> 2). "Wherever your eyes turn along the excavated sides of the rocks, you see steps often leading to nothing, or something which has crumbled away, often with their first steps worn away, so that they are now inaccessible" (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine,</span> p. 91). So Miss Martineau speaks of "short and odd staircases twisted hither and thither among the rocks." So, too, E. H. Palmer, Esq., in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, January, 1871: "There are many tombs and dwellings which are now inaccessible, but traces of staircases cut in the rock, and now broken away, may be seen everywhere." . . . "At the northern turn in the Wady, as you leave the western acclivities, are three large tombs, with perfect fronts. The first and largest of these . . . was at the time of our entry occupied by several families of the fellahin. Every tomb has its owner, who dwells there with his wives and family during the cold and wet weather." He goes on to speak of one tomb which was said to hold fifteen families.<p><span class= "bld">Whose habitation is high</span> . . .--Literally, <span class= "ital">loftiness of his habitation.</span> The red sandstone rocks are described as rising "perpendicularly to the height of one, two, or three hundred feet" (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine,</span> p. 89). The writer of the article "Selah" in Kitto's <span class= "ital">Biblical Cyclopaedia</span> says of the caves, "Some of them are apparently not less than from two hundred to three or four hundred feet above the level of the valley." When we think of the power of the conception which could frame a range of mountain rocks into a city, with ravines for streets and caverns for houses, we can understand the prophet's words, "the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee." Nor was it wonderful that the children of Esau should deem themselves invincible in their mountain fastnesses.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall bring me down to the ground?--</span>Prom this <span class= "ital">eagle's-nest</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm" title="Though you exalt yourself as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, there will I bring you down, said the LORD.">Obadiah 1:4</a>) Edom might well utter proud defiance against even the strongest foes. All travellers describe Petra as almost impregnable. It is not even visible from the heights in the neighbourhood. "The whole space, rocks and valleys, embedded in the mountains which girt it in, lay invisible even from the summit of Mount Hor." "Petra itself is entirely shut out by the intervening rocks. The great feature of the mountains of Edom is the mass of red bald-headed sandstone rocks, intersected not by valleys, but by deep seams. In the heart of these rocks, itself invisible, lies Petra." And it was as strongly guarded by nature as it was securely hidden. "Two known approaches only, from east and west, enter into it," and these are mere ravines. The most famous of them, the defile from the east, the one which "in ancient times was the chief--the only usual--approach to Petra," is named the <span class= "ital">Sik,</span> or <span class= "ital">cleft. "</span>The rocks are almost precipitous, or, rather, they would be if they did not, like their brethren in all this region, overlap, and crumble, and crack, as if they would crash over you. The gorge is about a mile and a half long, and the opening of the cliffs at the top is throughout almost as narrow as the narrowest part of the defile of Pfeffers, which in dimensions and form it more nearly resembles than any other of my acquaintance" (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine,</span> p. 89). The other approach, though not so picturesque and striking to the traveller, would have been equally difficult for an attacking army. Miss Martineau describes it as leading amid "wild fantastic mountains," "rocks in towering masses," "over steep and slippery passes," or "winding in recesses below." She continues: "A little further on we stopped in a hollow of the hills; our path, our very narrow path, lay over these whitish hills: now up, now down, and then, and then again, we were slipping and jerking down slopes of gaudy rock. For nearly an hour longer we were descending the pass; down we went, and still down; at length we came upon the platform above the bed of the torrent, near which stands the only edifice in Petra" (quoted from <span class= "ital">Eastern Life,</span> ii. 319, by Pusey). Such approaches might, it is obvious, be held by a very small force against a great superiority of numbers. The width of the <span class= "ital">sik</span> "is not more than just sufficient for the passage of two horsemen abreast," and "a few hundred men might defend the entrance against a large army" (Burckhar It, <span class= "ital">Travels in Syria and the Holy Land,</span> p. 432). Demetrius "the Besieger," at the head of 8,000 men (the 4,000 infantry selected for their swiftness of foot from the whole army), made repeated assaults on the place, but "those within had an easy victory, from its commanding height" (Pusey, from <span class= "ital">Diod. Sic. xix.</span> 96). Little need of art to strengthen such natural defences, yet Mr. Palmer noticed "a fort at the top of the left-hand ravine, occupying a most commanding position, as it overlooks the entire valley, and defends the only part not protected by some difficult mountain pass" (Quarterly Statement, Palestine Exploration Fund, January, 1871). And Dr. Pusey finely remarks: "But even the entrance gained, what gain besides, unless the people and its wealth were betrayed by a surprise? Striking as the rock-girt Petra was, a gem in its mountain setting, far more marvellous was it when, as in the prophet's time, the rock itself was Petra. Inside the defile, an invader would be outside the city yet. He might himself become the besieged rather than the besieger. In which of these eyries along all these ravines were the eagles to be found? From which of these lairs might not Edom's lion-sons burst out upon them? Multitudes gave the invaders no advantage in scaling those mountains' sides, where, observed themselves by an unseen enemy, they would at last have to fight man to man. What a bivouac were it in that narrow spot, themselves encircled by an enemy everywhere, anywhere, and visibly nowhere, among those thousand caves, each larger cave, maybe, an ambuscade! In man's sight Edom's boast was well founded; but what before God?" With the Edomites' vaunt Pusey aptly compares that of the Bactrian, Oxyartes, who, trusting to the strength of another Petra, defied Alexander the Great, bidding him get wings for his soldiers before attacking his stronghold. (Arrian, <span class= "ital">Exped. Alex.</span> iv. 18.)<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle.</span>--"Had, then, the ancient builders of these rock-works wings like the eagles, with which they raised themselves to those perpendicular precipices?" "Who now, even with the feet of the chamois, could climb after them?" (v. Schubert, ii. 429; quoted by Pusey). (Comp. also Miss Martineau, <span class= "ital">Eastern Life,</span> ii. 320, iii. 20.)<p>This is one of the passages which identifies the <span class= "ital">nesher,</span> always translated "eagle" in the Authorised Version, with the griffon-vulture. "While the eagles and other birds are content with lower elevations, and sometimes even with trees, the griffon alone selects the stupendous gorges of Arabia Petraea and of the defiles of Palestine, and there in great communities rears its young, where the most intrepid climber can only with ropes and other appliances reach its nest" (Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of the Bible,</span> p. 175; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/39-27.htm" title="Does the eagle mount up at your command, and make her nest on high?">Job 39:27-28</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And though thou set thy nest among the stars . . .</span>--The image of the eagle nesting among the stars is among the most forcible even in Hebrew poetry. Shakespeare approaches it in "eagle-winged pride of sky - aspiring and ambitious thoughts" (<span class= "ital">Richard II.,</span> i. 3).<p><span class= "bld">Thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.</span>--In the original, more striking," it is Jehovah's declaration." This sentence against pride, not only national, but individual too, is indeed the Divine declaration, uttered in warning voice from one end of Scripture to the other. The doom pronounced against Edom is but one special instance of the universal truth told so powerfully by Isaiah at the end of Isaiah 2 : "The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low." And it was the more than once repeated declaration of the Son of God: "He that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vision of Obadiah.</span> This is the title of the book, declaring from whom and through whom the revelation comes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>). Under the word "vision" in prophetic language is included, not only what the seer saw, the mental picture presented to his inner senses, but also all that he is commissioned to disclose or enunciate. <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom</span>. The prophet declares that God speaks through him. One might have expected that the actual words of Jehovah would follow here instead of tidings heard from him. And this difficulty has led some to suppose these introductory words spurious or the insertion of a later hand, others to include them and the rest of the verse in a parenthesis, so as to begin the "vision" with God's words in ver. 2. But these suggestions are unnecessary. The prophet, as the mouthpiece of God, calls his own words the message of the Lord - signifies that what had been revealed to his mind he was bound to communicate to others as a direct warning from God. The Edomites were the descendants of Esau, and bound by ties of blood to the Israelites; but they had always been their most bitter enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>). They are regarded as a type of the powers of the world hostile to true religion, whose end is destruction. <span class="cmt_word">We have heard.</span> "We" - I myself and other prophets; or the Judaeans, the prophet identifying himself with his countrymen. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, I heard, so <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>; Arabic, "ye have heard." <span class="cmt_word">A rumour;</span> <span class="accented">a report</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">auditum</span> (Vulgate). It means here "tidings" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An ambassador;</span> <span class="accented">a messenger</span>; as though the prophet saw the minister of God's wrath going forth among the heathen to rouse them to war against Edom. Perowne thinks that there is an allusion to the composite character of Nebuchadnezzar's army with which he attacked the Edomites. The Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>: so the Syriac, Chaldee, and Symmachus translate "message." This rendering is explained by the following clause. <span class="cmt_word">The heathen</span> (<span class="accented">goyim</span>); <span class="accented">the nations, as</span> vers. 2, 15. <span class="cmt_word">Arise ye, and let us rise.</span> This has been taken as if "arise ye" were the herald's message, and "let us rise" the response of the nations echoing his words; but it is more forcible to consider the whole clause as the message, the ambassador joining himself with the heathen as their leader and comrade in the war of vengeance. Vers. 1-9 are incorporated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-22</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-16 This prophecy is against Edom. Its destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to the destruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction of the success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. All the enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things they stay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exalt themselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, and makes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be so safely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of our covenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we join ourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justly deny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use their understandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness, is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against any of God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem, is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good to consider what we should have done; to compare our practice with the Scripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for, who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when able to be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to make themselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceive themselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay their hands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God, it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressors know, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those of the wicked will be eternal.</body></html>
