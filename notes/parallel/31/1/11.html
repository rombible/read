The words may denote either malicious unconcern, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a> (12), or hostile opposition, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-13.htm">2 Samuel 18:13</a>. Besides the direct application to recent events, the clause intimates the usual attitude of the Edomites toward Israel. <span class="cmt_word">In the day that the strangers</span> - Philistines and Arabians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">carried away captive his forces;</span> rather, <span class="accented">carried array his substance, as</span> ver. 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-29.htm">Genesis 34:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-4.htm">Isaiah 8:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Foreigners</span>.

Nothing is said of the total destruction of Jerusalem or the wholesale deportation of the inhabitants to Babylon, So that Obadiah cannot be referring to the Chaldean conquest. <span class="cmt_word">Thou wast as one of them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">thou, too, as one of them</span>. In this expression the past is set before the mind as present. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-16 This prophecy is against Edom. Its destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to the destruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction of the success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. All the enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things they stay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exalt themselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, and makes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be so safely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of our covenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we join ourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justly deny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use their understandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness, is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against any of God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem, is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good to consider what we should have done; to compare our practice with the Scripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for, who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when able to be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to make themselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceive themselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay their hands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God, it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressors know, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those of the wicked will be eternal.</body></html>
