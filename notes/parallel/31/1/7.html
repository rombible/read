The allies intended may be Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, who joined together to resist Nebuchadnezzar, and were smitten by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>); or, as Perowne thinks, the Chaldeans themselves, who, though the Edomites had aided in the attack on Jerusalem, afterwards turned against them. Have brought thee even to the border; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "They sent thee forth unto thy borders;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Usque ad terminum emiserunt ii.</span> Keil and others explain this to mean that the Edomites send ambassadors to their allies, asking help, but these messengers are conducted back to the frontier with their request not granted, because the allies are unwilling to entangle themselves in the fate of Eden. It is easier to understand the passage in this way - Thy very allies have assisted the enemy in ex-polling thee from thy borders, and refusing to receive fugitives who came to them. The men that were at peace with thee. Either the same as "the men of thy confederacy," or the neighbouring Arabian tribes who resorted to Petra for commercial reasons (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a>). The phrase here, literally, <span class="accented">the men of thy peace</span>, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> and Jot. 38:22. Have deceived thee, by not bringing the expected help; and have prevailed against thee, by actual violence. They that eat thy bread. The Hebrew is simply, "thy bread," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of thy bread. Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui comedunt tecum</span>; <span class="accented">the</span> LXX. omits the words. The expression (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>) implies the closest friendship, especially in Eastern lands, where such a tie is of general obligation. <span class="cmt_word">Have laid a wound under thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">lay a snare under thee</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "they set snares under thee;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ponent insidias subter te</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-22.htm">Psalm 69:22</a>). Another interpretation is this: "As thy bread (which they as friends were bound to offer) they lay a sling under thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prepare an ambush for thee, like Jael did for Sisera. Pusey notes the climax in this verse - not confederates only, but friends; not friends only, but familiar friends, indebted to them. Those banded with them should expel them from their country; those at peace should prevail against them in war; those who ate their bread should requite them with treachery. There is none understanding in him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Edom. The shock of this defection of allies and the sudden destruction that has overwhelmed them have deprived the Edomites of their wonted sagacity and prudence. They know not whither to turn or what to do. The following verse expands this thought. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-16 This prophecy is against Edom. Its destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to the destruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction of the success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. All the enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things they stay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exalt themselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, and makes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be so safely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of our covenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we join ourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justly deny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use their understandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness, is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against any of God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem, is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good to consider what we should have done; to compare our practice with the Scripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for, who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when able to be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to make themselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceive themselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay their hands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God, it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressors know, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those of the wicked will be eternal.</body></html>
