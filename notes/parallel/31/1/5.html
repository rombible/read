It is no mere inroad of a marauding tribe. Something would escape the <span class= "ital">robber,</span> though he might go away quite satisfied with his plunder; and even a raid in vintage time, for the purpose of doing all the mischief possible to the country, would leave here and there a scattered bunch, gleanings for the inhabitants when the spoilers had retired, but now everything is doomed to destruction. Edom is completely robbed and ransacked. Notice how the sad, almost pathetic, conviction of this breaks out--as if rather from a friend (<span class= "ital">see</span> Introduction) than an enemy--in the parenthetical "how art thou cut off!" in the very middle of the sentence. Every one must perceive, the prophet seems to say, a higher hand at work here.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Some grapes.--</span><span class= "ital">Gleanings,</span> as in margin. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm" title="Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, said the LORD God of Israel.">Isaiah 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-13.htm" title="When thus it shall be in the middle of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.">Isaiah 24:13</a>.)<p>(6) <span class= "bld">How are the things of Esau searched out!</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">How are they searched out Esau!</span> Where Esau is either taken collectively = Edom as a nation, or we must supply, as in the Authorised Version, "the things of," or, as Ewald, "they of." For <span class= "ital">search,</span> comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.">Zephaniah 1:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">His hidden things.--</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">matspunim,</span> from <span class= "ital">tsapan =</span> to hide, but whether <span class= "ital">hidden treasures</span> or <span class= "ital">hiding places</span> cannot be determined, as the word only occurs here.<p>(7-9) Overtaken by this terrible calamity, and deserted by her allies, Edom will turn in vain for counsel to her senators and wise men, and for support to her heroes and mighty men, for these will not only share in the general ruin, but are marked out for an overthrow as signal as their renown.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">All the men of thy confederacy. . . .--</span>This desertion by allies is doubtless put prominently forward as the due retribution on Edom for his treachery and cruelty to his natural ally, his brother Jacob. The members of the confederacy are not specified. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm" title="And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;">Jeremiah 27:3</a> we find Edom associated with Moab, Ainmon, Tyre, and Sidon, in the warning to submit to Nebuchadnezzar. The two former would be the natural allies of Edom, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-8.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like to all the heathen;">Ezekiel 25:8</a> Seir is joined with Moab as reproaching Israel. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm" title="Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph you because of me.">Psalm 60:8</a>, we may add to these Philistia (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-19.htm" title="And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.">Obadiah 1:19</a>). The expression "have brought thee to the border" is variously understood. The most natural explanation is that the fugitives from the ruin of Edom, flying into the territory of neighbouring and allied tribes for help, are basely driven back to their own frontier, and left to their fate.<p><span class= "bld">The men that were at peace with thee</span>.--As in margin, <span class= "ital">the men of thy peace,</span> an expressive Hebrew idiom occurring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-10.htm" title="For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.">Jeremiah 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-22.htm" title="And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Your friends have set you on, and have prevailed against you: your feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.">Jeremiah 38:22</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm" title="Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.">Psalm 41:9</a>, where it is translated "mine own familiar friend."<p>Great difference of opinion exists as to the connection of this and the following clause, and as it stands the text presents considerable difficulty. By dropping the italicised words in our version, and omitting the semicolon, we get, "The men of thy peace have deceived thee, prevailed against thee and thy bread, have laid a wound under thee." There are two verbal difficulties--(1) "wound," Heb., <span class= "ital">mazor,</span> which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm" title="When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.">Hosea 5:13</a> in the sense of a festering wound or abscess, but which the older translators here render <span class= "ital">ambush,</span> or snare; <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> (LXX.); <span class= "ital">insidi?</span> (Vulg.). Ewald and Hitzig, among moderns, prefer <span class= "ital">net,</span> and defend it etymologically. This certainly gives good sense, and if <span class= "ital">z-r,</span> of which it is a derivative, can have the sense of <span class= "ital">binding,</span> may be correct. Our translators in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-13.htm" title="There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.">Jeremiah 30:13</a>, and Aquila and Symmachus in this passage, evidently give it that force (see also Lee's <span class= "ital">Heb. Lex., sub voce</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> To <span class= "ital">squeeze</span> or <span class= "ital">crush,</span> however, seems the true meaning of <span class= "ital">z-r:</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-38.htm" title="And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.">Judges 6:38</a>, of Gideon's fleece; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-15.htm" title="And forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.">Job 39:15</a>, of the eggs of the ostrich. The preposition <span class= "ital">tachath =</span> under, also offers a difficulty; "<span class= "ital">Laid a wound under thee"</span> suggests no intelligible meaning. But on the authority (though possibly somewhat doubtful) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-12.htm" title="And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.">2Samuel 3:12</a>, where the word is translated "on behalf of," but where the context requires "without his knowledge," and on the analogy of all other languages, we may (with Vatablus, Drusius, Luther, and L. de Dieu; see Keil) translate the word <span class= "ital">deceitfully,</span> or <span class= "ital">without thy knowledge,</span> a rendering in accordance with the parallelism. But the syntax of the passage still remains unexplained. What is the construction of <span class= "ital">lachmeka=</span>of thy bread? From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm" title="Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.">Psalm 41:9</a>, "The man of my peace which did eat of my bread," we are led to the conjecture that it forms part of a familiar, perhaps proverbial, expression for one bound by the closest ties of fellowship and hospitality, and we must, therefore, either supply a participle, <span class= "ital">these eating,</span> as in the Psalm, or understand a second <span class= "ital">anshey</span>=men of. It is true there is no other instance of the phrase "men of thy bread," but it is a conceivable Hebrew idiom. Keeping the parallelism we now get an intelligible rendering of the passage.<p>"Unto the border they sent thee, all the men of thy confederacy.<p>Deceived thee, ruined thee,<p>Men of thy peace, men of thy bread;<p>(They) gave thee a wound in secret.<p>No understanding (is) in him."<p>For the arrangement of the second clause, which is put for <span class= "ital">deceived thee the men of thy peace, ruined thee the men of thy bread,</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-5.htm" title="I am black, but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.">Song of Solomon 1:5</a>, and Note there. In the last clause the margin reads <span class= "ital">of it: i.e.,</span> of the injury just mentioned, instead of <span class= "ital">in him.</span> But it is better to take it as an abrupt declaration in the prophet's manner (comp. "how art thou cut off!" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm" title="If thieves came to you, if robbers by night, (how are you cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some grapes?">Obadiah 1:5</a>) of the utter bewilderment that had come or was coming on Edom, unable either by counsel or force to withstand his foes.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Shall I not</span> . . .--Literally, <span class= "ital">Surely in that day</span>--it is Jehovah's saying--<span class= "ital">I will make sages disappear from Edom, and understanding from Esau's mountain.</span><p>The tradition of a peculiar sagacity in Edom, and especially in Teman (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm" title="Concerning Edom, thus said the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?">Jeremiah 49:7</a>), lingered long. Job's sage friend Eliphaz was a Temanite. In <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/baruch/3-22.htm" title="It hath not been heard of in Chanaan, neither hath it been seen in Theman.">Baruch 3:22-23</a> we read: "It (wisdom) hath not been heard of in Chanaan, neither hath it been seen in Theman. The Agarenes that seek wisdom upon earth, the merchants of Meran and of Theman, the authors (margin, <span class= "ital">expounders</span>) of fables and searchers out of understanding, none of these have known the way of wisdom, or remember her paths." Jeremiah's words show even more strikingly how high the reputation had been: "Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?" "The men of the world think that they hold their wisdom and all God's natural gifts independently of the giver. God, by the events of His natural providence, as here by His word, shows, through some withdrawal of their wisdom, that it is His, not theirs. Men wonder at the sudden failure, the flaw in the well-arranged plan, the one over-confident act which ruins the whole scheme, the over-shrewdness which betrays itself, or the unaccountable oversight." So the utter want of perception and foresight in Edom seems unaccountable, till we think of the Divine purpose and end in it all. The wise were destroyed, and the mighty men dismayed, "to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter." It is the prophetic statement of the truth of the old heathen proverb: "Whom God wishes to destroy He first dements."<p>(9) For Teman, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm" title="Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come on him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.">Job 2:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5, 6.</span> - To prove the completeness of the destruction that shall befall Eden, the prophet supposes two cases of despoiling in which something would be left behind. It will be far worse than any mere raid of thieves; nothing will be spared. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thieves... robbers.</span> The former are ordinary thieves who pilfer secretly; the latter are robbers who act with violence, or members of a marauding expedition. <span class="cmt_word">How art thou cut off!</span> An interposed ejaculation of the prophet, sympathizing with the Edomites for the utter desolation which he sees in vision.

Till they had enough. Would they not have taken such plunder as they wanted, and then decamped? The grape gatherers would leave some bunches untouched, which escaped their notice. There is no reference to the charitable law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-21.htm">Deuteronomy 24:21</a>, which would not affect, or be known unto, these grape plunderers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-16 This prophecy is against Edom. Its destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to the destruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction of the success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. All the enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things they stay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exalt themselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, and makes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be so safely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of our covenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we join ourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justly deny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use their understandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness, is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against any of God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem, is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good to consider what we should have done; to compare our practice with the Scripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for, who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when able to be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to make themselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceive themselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay their hands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God, it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressors know, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those of the wicked will be eternal.</body></html>
