This is not primarily the final day of judgment, but the time when "Jehovah reveals his majesty and omnipotence in a glorious manner, to overthrow all ungodly powers, and to complete his kingdom" (Keil). It is announced by <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14</a>; but the notion of a judgment to fall on Gentile nations, and to issue in the establishment of the kingdom of God, was familiar long before. Balaam had seen it in dim vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17-24</a>); Hannah had anticipated the destruction that would accompany it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9, 10</a>); so had David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5-7</a>) in his last words; it is clearly predicted in the Psalms (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a> and 110.) (Knabenbauer). Is near. Because every such judgment upon individual nations is typical of the great day and preparative of it. As thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>). This law of retribution was the ideal of heathen justice, according to the Rhadamanthian rule, "If a man should suffer what he hath done, then there would be strict justice" (Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.' 5:5. 3). Thy reward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-7.htm">Joel 3:7</a> [4:7, Hebrew]; better, <span class="accented">that which thou hast performed</span> - thy work or dealing, <span class="cmt_word">Upon thine own head.</span> Like a stone cast towards heaven (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9.htm">Esther 9</a>. '25). <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-16 This prophecy is against Edom. Its destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to the destruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction of the success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. All the enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things they stay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exalt themselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, and makes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be so safely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of our covenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we join ourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justly deny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use their understandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness, is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against any of God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem, is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good to consider what we should have done; to compare our practice with the Scripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for, who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when able to be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to make themselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceive themselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay their hands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God, it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressors know, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those of the wicked will be eternal.</body></html>
