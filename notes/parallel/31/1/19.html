In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21, 33, 48</a>, the inheritance of Judah is distributed into three portions - the south, the plain, and the mountains; the same divisions are noticeable here (see note on Zechariah 7:7). <span class="cmt_word">They of the south.</span> The inhabitants of the <span class="accented">Negeb</span>, "the dry country" the southern part of Judah, shall take possession of Idumea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They of the plain.</span> Of the <span class="accented">Shephelah</span>, or "low land" - the maritime plain and the country held by the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall possess.</span> The Judaeans not already mentioned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those of the mountains, shall take the territory of the ten tribes. <span class="cmt_word">The fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria.</span> The country, and the capital.

Others translate, "Ephraim shall possess the field of Samaria," considering that otherwise Ephraim would be excluded from the restored kingdom, and Judah would inherit the territory of Ephraim, in violation of the covenant (Briggs, 'Messianic' Prophecy,' p. 317). But the Israelites proper were merged in the Judaeans at the return; and if Benjamin possesses Gilead, it is not unnatural that Judah should extend northward to Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And Benjamin shall possess Gilead.</span> Benjamin, the other portion of the house of Jacob, whose territory originally reached to the river, shall possess all the territory on the other side of Jordan. Thus the restored people shall, in accordance with the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>, "spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1-3</a>). Obadiah sees the twelve tribes, once more united, extending their territory on every side; and, to make this evident, he gives certain examples, using Judah and Benjamin as equivalent to "the people of God," and their enlargement as denoting the majestic progress of the kingdom of God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-21 There should be deliverance and holiness at Jerusalem, and the house of Jacob would again occupy their possessions. Much of this prophecy was fulfilled when the Jews returned to their own land. But the salvation and holiness of the gospel, its spread, and the conversion of the Gentiles, seem also to be intended, especially the restoration of Israel, the destruction of antichrist, and the prosperous state of the church, to which all the prophets bear witness. When Christ is come, and not till then, shall the kingdom be the Lord's in the full sense of the term. As none that exalt themselves against the Lord shall prosper, and all shall be brought down; so none that wait upon the Lord, and put their trust in him, shall ever be dismayed. Blessed be the Divine Saviour and Judge on Mount Zion! His word shall be a savour of life unto life unto numbers, while it judges and condemns obstinate unbelievers.</body></html>
