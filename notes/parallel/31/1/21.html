2, The prophet sums up his prediction: with the conquest of the Gentiles <span class="accented">salvation shall come to Zion in all its fulness. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Saviours</span>. The LXX. incorrectly takes the word passively, translating it <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "they that are saved;" so Aquila, Theodolion, and the Syriac; Symmachus rightly, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">salvatores</span>. The judges are so called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9, 15</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Nehemiah 9:27</a>). The judges had a twofold character - they were deliverers and governors, as in the present ease. Here the immediate reference is to Zerubbabel and the valiant Maccabees, who severely punished the Idumeans (2 Macc. 10:15, etc.; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:09. 1). But all these "saviours" are types and forerunners of the Messiah, "the Saviour which is Christ the Lord?" Shall come up. Not from exile, but simply as ascending a hill, and taking their seat there. <span class="cmt_word">Mount Zion.</span> The seat of the kingdom of God, in contrast with "the mount of Esau," the type of the enemies of Israel and of God. <span class="cmt_word">To judge;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to take vengeance on." But the "judging" is not only the taking of vengeance on Edom and that which it represents, the expression includes the notion of governing; so that the prophet looks forward to the time when the heathen shall submit themselves to the dominion of the people of God, and, as the following clause foretells, "the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom shall be the Lord's.</span> No earthly accomplishment could fulfil this great announcement. The kingdom can be Jehovah's; he can show himself as Ruler of the world, and be acknowledged as such by the nations, only under Christ. This is "the sceptre of Judah" of which Jacob spoke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>); this is the throne of David which was to be established forever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>); this is what all the prophets fore, w, what we are still expecting, what we daily pray for, as we say, "thy kingdom come" - when "the Lord shall be King over all the earth, and there shall be one Lord, and his name one" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-21 There should be deliverance and holiness at Jerusalem, and the house of Jacob would again occupy their possessions. Much of this prophecy was fulfilled when the Jews returned to their own land. But the salvation and holiness of the gospel, its spread, and the conversion of the Gentiles, seem also to be intended, especially the restoration of Israel, the destruction of antichrist, and the prosperous state of the church, to which all the prophets bear witness. When Christ is come, and not till then, shall the kingdom be the Lord's in the full sense of the term. As none that exalt themselves against the Lord shall prosper, and all shall be brought down; so none that wait upon the Lord, and put their trust in him, shall ever be dismayed. Blessed be the Divine Saviour and Judge on Mount Zion! His word shall be a savour of life unto life unto numbers, while it judges and condemns obstinate unbelievers.</body></html>
