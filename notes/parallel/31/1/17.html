Three divisions are enumerated of the house of Jacob (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Judah; see Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm" title="And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken it.">Obadiah 1:18</a>), and separate mention made of Benjamin.<p><span class= "bld">They of the south.</span>--Those at present occupying the <span class= "ital">south</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">negev</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the <span class= "ital">dry parched</span> country forming the southern portion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm" title="And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,">Joshua 15:21</a>), are to inhabit Mount Esau: <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> are to extend their territory to its extreme south-eastern limit; they of the Shephelah, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the western lowland on the Mediterranean, are to seize on the neighbouring Philistia, at present Idumaean; while they at present confined to the hill-country in the north and centre of Judah are to spread themselves over Ephraim and Samaria. Our present Hebrew text leaves the subject of this latter clause uncertain, as it is in the Authorised Version "they." But the LXX., <span class= "greekheb">?? ????</span> indicates that <span class= "ital">hahor=</span>the mountain, has dropped out, a conjecture which is abundantly borne out by the geographical arrangement of the localities in the passage. Benjamin, for which no room is left on the west of Jordan, is to push across it into Gilead instead. This prophetic vision recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm" title="And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 28:14</a>.<p>(20) But there are still others of the restored Israel, besides those comprised within the ancient territory of Judah. The prophetic survey proceeds northwards, and we get a general idea from this verse that there were exiles, who had found refuge on the north-western and northern boundaries of ancient Palestine, who would settle themselves partly on the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, partly in the south country, whose inhabitants had pushed downwards into Edom. But while this is plainly its general drift, the text is full of difficulties.<p>It is difficult to attach an intelligible meaning to "the captivity (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> exiles, <span class= "ital">galuth</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-4.htm" title="So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.">Isaiah 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-13.htm" title="I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, said the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 45:13</a>) of this host of (literally, <span class= "ital">to</span>) the sons of Israel."<p>The prophet seems to allude to some body of exiles, including himself, who had escaped from the army. But there is a difference of opinion among grammarians as to the identification of <span class= "ital">chel</span> with <span class= "ital">chayil</span> = host. Ewald takes it to be a dialectic variety of <span class= "ital">chol =</span> sand, generally of the sea-coast; and so here "the banished ones of <span class= "ital">this</span> coast," where the prophet was at the time. The rendering <span class= "ital">chel=</span>trench, or fortification, which some adopt, is out of the question. The LXX. have <span class= "greekheb">??? ??????????? ? ????</span>, but whether <span class= "greekheb">????</span><span class= "ital"> = power</span>, or <span class= "ital">beginning,</span> with allusion to the first dispersion of exiles, cannot be determined. Another difficulty arises with respect to the words <span class= "ital">that of the Canaanites</span>--<span class= "ital">asher Khenaanim</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">which Canaanites</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> To make it an object, as in our version, the particle <span class= "ital">eth</span> is wanted, and Ewald, instead of <span class= "ital">asher,</span> reads <span class= "ital">eth-ari = the cities of.</span> That some change has taken place in the text appears from the LXX., who have <span class= "greekheb">??</span><span class= "ital">, the land</span> (Heb., <span class= "ital">erets</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Keil, keeping the present reading, renders, "And the captives of this army of the sons of Israel (will take possession) of what Canaanites there are as far as Zarephath . . ." Pusey: "And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel which are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath," making it joint subject with "the captives of Jerusalem" to "shall possess the cities of the south," which is in accordance with the construction of the LXX. and the Syriac. But the absence of the preposition <span class= "ital">be</span> before <span class= "ital">Khenaanim</span> seems to make this rendering impossible. The Hebrew as it stands can only mean "which are Canaanites." The choice lies between Ewald's emendation of the text and Keil's interpretation. The Jews understand by Zarephath the country of <span class= "ital">France.</span><p>The last clause is better in the text than in the margin: "The exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall take possession of the cities of the south." The only difficulty is in the name Sepharad, a place never mentioned elsewhere, and which has not yet been satisfactorily identified. The various conjectures have been--<p>1. That of the LXX., <span class= "greekheb">??? ??????</span> followed by the Arabic translation, probably from reading <span class= "ital">Sepharath.</span> Jerome, in his Commentary on Obadiah, appears to have understood this reading as pointing to the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Phrath,</span> since he translates, <span class= "ital">Transmigratio Jerusalem usque Euphratem.</span><p>2. The reading of the Vulg., <span class= "ital">qu? in Bosphoro est,</span> was derived by Jerome from a Jewish instructor, who treated the particle in <span class= "ital">Bisparad</span> as part of the name, and rejected the final <span class= "ital">d</span> altogether.<p>3. The Targum Jonathan, the Peshito-Syriac, and from them the modern Jews, interpret Sepharad as Spain (Ispamia or Ispania); hence <span class= "ital">Sephardim,</span> a name for the Spanish Jews.<p>4. Sipphara in Mesopotamia. But this is more probably identified with <span class= "ital">Sepharvaim.</span><p>5. Sardis, from a supposed connection with �PaRaD. or (�parda, mentioned in the great arrow-headed inscription of Nakshi Rustam, in a list of names of tribes between Cappadocia and Ionia, which De Sacy identified with <span class= "ital">Sepharad</span>, and Lassen with <span class= "ital">Sardis.</span><p>6. Sparta. Some relations there were between the Jews after the captivity and the Lacedaemonians (see <a href="https://biblehub.com//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/12-2.htm" title="He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to other places, for the same purpose.">1 Maccabees 12:2</a>, <span class= "ital">seqq.,</span> 14:16, <span class= "ital">seqq.,</span> 15:23). Possibly there was a colony of the exiles in Sparta.<p>7. Ewald conjectures <span class= "ital">Sepharam</span> instead of <span class= "ital">Sepharad,</span> and finds the place in Shefa Amar, a well-known place a few miles south-east of Acco. The general drift of the passage seems to require some place not far distant from, and in the direction of, Zarephath. The only serious objection to this conjecture is the fact that Shefa Amar was within the boundaries of Palestine, and therefore those who had taken refuge there would not strictly be exiles. But it is distinctly stated that these were "of Jerusalem," and they might well be called refugees, since they had had to go so far north to find an asylum.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">Saviours.--</span>Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Judges 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-27.htm" title="Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard them from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.">Nehemiah 9:27</a>. The Jewish interpreters understood by "saviours" men like the judges of old, Gideon, Barak, &c., who will chastise the Christians and subdue them. The Mount of Esau is of course, according to this interpretation, Rome.<p><span class= "bld">And the kingdom shall be the Lord's.--</span>See the reference in margin to Zechariah, who gives this anticipation of the pure form of the theocracy in its wider extent. But here, too, the prophetic look over the world seems to extend far beyond Judah and the fortunes of the Jewish race, and as the vision widens Zion and Edom both retire from sight; both are comprehended in the one Divine kingdom, and God is all in all.

The Hebrew pronoun is ambiguous, and "their possessions" may mean either those that the Jews themselves had lost, or those of the Edomites. But nothing is said of Israel being carried away captive and losing its country; and, though the prophet may have looked forward to such a catastrophe and to a future restoration, this is not the subject here. The possessions referred to are those of the enemy represented by the Edomites, and those which the Jews had lost since the days of David and Solomon; and "the house of Jacob" signifies, not merely the earthly kingdom of Judah, but "the people of God, who are eventually to obtain the dominion of the world" (Keil); <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:17-21 There should be deliverance and holiness at Jerusalem, and the house of Jacob would again occupy their possessions. Much of this prophecy was fulfilled when the Jews returned to their own land. But the salvation and holiness of the gospel, its spread, and the conversion of the Gentiles, seem also to be intended, especially the restoration of Israel, the destruction of antichrist, and the prosperous state of the church, to which all the prophets bear witness. When Christ is come, and not till then, shall the kingdom be the Lord's in the full sense of the term. As none that exalt themselves against the Lord shall prosper, and all shall be brought down; so none that wait upon the Lord, and put their trust in him, shall ever be dismayed. Blessed be the Divine Saviour and Judge on Mount Zion! His word shall be a savour of life unto life unto numbers, while it judges and condemns obstinate unbelievers.</body></html>
