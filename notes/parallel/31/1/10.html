Various acts of hostility and treachery towards Israel are specified by the prophet, in a manner to lead to the feeling that though his tone is prohibitory, he is recalling instances of past malignity on Edom's part, as types of what might be found in the future.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">For thy violence</span> . . .--Literally, <span class= "ital">for injury of thy brother Jacob,</span> &c.; the genitive of the object, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm" title="Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.">Joel 3:19</a>. The crime was the more heinous because against the brother tribe. Probably the birth-name, Jacob, of the twin brother of Esau is used purposely to bring out the full wickedness of the descendants of Esau. In spite of all provocations, Israel long maintained the duty of a friendly feeling for the kindred race--maintained it as a religious duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-5.htm" title="Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm" title="You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother: you shall not abhor an Egyptian; because you were a stranger in his land.">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>). On the other hand, Edom from the first assumed a jealous and hostile attitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm" title="And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus said your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has befallen us:">Numbers 20:14</a>, <span class= "ital">seqq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> never imitating the generous disposition of their great ancestor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-4.htm" title="And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.">Genesis 33:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Shame shall cover thee.</span>--Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-10.htm" title="Then she that is my enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said to me, Where is the LORD your God? my eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.">Micah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-25.htm" title="We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.">Jeremiah 3:25</a>.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">In the day</span> . . .--Literally, <span class= "ital">In the day of thy standing over against,</span> as if to particularise some one occasion; but instead of proceeding to state it, the prophet recalls other events of the same time, and sums up Edom's offence in the charge, "thou, too, as one of them," acting the part of an enemy instead of that of a friend, though probably in the base character of a neutral (comp. "My lovers and my friends stand <span class= "ital">aloof</span> from my sore," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm" title="My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.">Psalm 38:11</a>), ready to take the winning side.<p><span class= "bld">Forces.--</span>It is difficult to choose between this and the marginal reading, <span class= "ital">substance.

It is natural to regard this latter event as identical with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm" title="And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.">Joel 3:3</a>, the final destruction of Jerusalem and dispersion of its inhabitants into captivity.

The word is repeated with the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm" title="You should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yes, you should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;">Obadiah 1:13</a>. Pusey remarks: "Malicious gazing on human calamity, forgetful of man's common origin and common liability to ill, is the worst form of human hate. It was one of the contumelies of the Cross."<p><span class= "bld">In the day that he became a stranger.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">in the day of his strangeness.</span> The form <span class= "ital">nokher</span> is only found here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-3.htm" title="Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?">Job 31:3</a> (<span class= "ital">nekher</span>) with different pointing, where it is translated "strange punishment." The adjective <span class= "ital">nokhri,</span> also, has always the sense of <span class= "ital">strange,</span> though the root-verb seems to have the signification <span class= "ital">to recognise.</span> From <span class= "ital">to recognise an apparent stranger</span> to <span class= "ital">treat as a stranger</span> (which the derived conjugations, that alone are used, sometimes mean) is a natural transition. Perhaps here, "unheard of calamity."<p><span class= "bld">Spoken proudly.</span>--Literally, as in marg., <span class= "ital">made thy mouth great</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-21.htm" title="Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye has seen it.">Psalm 35:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-4.htm" title="Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are you not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood.">Isaiah 57:4</a>). The mention of <span class= "ital">grimaces</span> adds to the graphic character of the picture. Again we are reminded of the wanton and savage insolence around the Cross.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">The day of their calamity.--</span>Thrice repeated, to bring into prominence the malignity of Edom's conduct. The same expression used by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm" title="Because you have had a perpetual hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:">Ezekiel 35:5</a>), in the same connection, probably with reference to the same occasion.<p><span class= "bld">Calamity.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">eyd.</span> Variously derived and explained, either as <span class= "ital">load of trouble</span> or <span class= "ital">dark gloomy time.</span><p>(14) <span class= "bld">Crossway.--</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">perek</span> = separated (English, <span class= "ital">fork</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It only occurs here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-1.htm" title="Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departs not;">Nahum 3:1</a>, where it is translated <span class= "ital">robbery</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> that which is torn or divided.

But probably it had become a recognised prophetic expression long before it was committed to writing. The primary meaning is not the day of judgment, but the day on which Jehovah reveals His majesty and omnipotence in a glorious manner, to overthrow all ungodly powers and to complete His kingdom. As the misfortunes of Israel increased, and the hostility of surrounding nations gathered to a successful head, it was natural that the idea of retribution upon them for their violence to the chosen race should usurp the prominent place in prophecy. The "day of Jehovah" became the day of Jehovah's <span class= "ital">wrath</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-18.htm" title="Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.">Zephaniah 1:18</a>) and Jehovah's <span class= "ital">vengeance</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-8.htm" title="For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.">Isaiah 34:8</a>). The fading of the temporal hopes implied in the expression naturally led to its higher religious use; and the various phrases for the same idea--"the day," "the great day," "the day of judgment," "the last day"--passed first into Jewish, and afterwards into Christian, eschatology, taking with them all the prophetic imagery which painted the expectancy of Israel: imagery of the splendour of victory and triumph on the one side, of terrible overthrow and slaughter on the other, but rich as well with its infinite spiritual suggestiveness.<p><span class= "bld">As thou hast done</span> . . .--For this stern announcement of the <span class= "ital">lex talionis</span> on the offending nation, comp. (in addition to the reference in marg.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-7.htm" title="Behold, I will raise them out of the place where you have sold them, and will return your recompense on your own head:">Joel 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm" title="O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewards you as you have served us.">Psalm 137:8</a>.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">As ye have drunk</span> . . .--For the figure, so common in prophecy and so expressive, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/25-27.htm" title="Therefore you shall say to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink you, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.">Jeremiah 25:27-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-8.htm" title="For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/18-3.htm" title="For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.">Revelation 18:3-6</a>. But who are addressed, the people of Jerusalem or the Edomites? The question is perplexed. If we keep the tropical sense of <span class= "ital">drink</span> in both clauses, which is the most natural way, understanding by it the cup of suffering, since it is said to have been drunk on Mount Zion, it must have been drained by Israelites, as Ewald and others take the passage. On the other hand, it seems awkward to make the prophet turn from addressing Edom to Judah, not else addressed in his prophecy. If taken in a literal sense, the drinking on Mount Zion would, of course, refer to the carousing and revelry which always followed heathen victory, and sometimes with terrible aggravation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm" title="And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.">Joel 3:3</a>). Taking the passage in this sense, we must understand the prophet to take Edom as a type of all heathen in their attitude towards Israel, so that what he says of one nation applies to all. But it is quite possible that our text embodies an old oracular saying addressed to Israel. This is Ewald's view.<p><span class= "bld">Swallow down.</span>--Margin, <span class= "ital">sup up.</span> The substantive <span class= "ital">loa'</span> signifies a throat. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-3.htm" title="For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.">Job 6:3</a> : "Therefore my words are swallowed up.")<p><span class= "bld">Shall be as though they had not been.--</span>For the expression, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-19.htm" title="I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.">Job 10:19</a>. Here, <span class= "ital">totally insensible from the effects of the draughty,</span> therefore <span class= "ital">dead, destroyed.</span><p>The word <span class= "ital">continually</span> offers some difficulty. Ewald translates <span class= "ital">immediately,</span> but this is not the natural sense of <span class= "ital">tamid,</span> which seems rather to express that <span class= "ital">continuous</span> display of the Divine purpose and judgment in the overthrow overtaking successively the proud monarchies of the heathen. "God employs each nation in turn to give that cup to the other. So Edom drank it at the hand of Babylon, and Babylon from the Medes, and the Medes and Persians from the Macedonians, and the Macedonians from the Romans, and they from the barbarians."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-14.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The cause of Edom's destruction</span>. This punishment falls upon her as the result of the malice and unfriendliness which she has displayed to wards Israel in the time of calamity, in that she rejoiced at her sister's disaster and took part with her enemies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy violence against thy brother Jacob.</span> The special action to which Obadiah alludes, and which he particularizes in the following verses, occurred at the time of the invasion of Judaea by Philistines and Arabians during the reign of Jehoram, when the Edomites sided with the enemy, and acted as the prophet intimates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>, etc.; see Introduction, &sect; III.). The iniquity of such conduct is aggravated by the fact that the victim was the "brother Jacob," who was commanded not to hate the Edomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>). This enjoined friendship was not reciprocated by the descendants of Esau. Whether from envy at the superior privileges of Israel, or from other causes, the Edomites, from the time of Moses, had always been actively hostile to the Israelites. They had been subdued by David, but had lately rebelled and scoured their independence, and were always looking for an opportunity of revenging themselves on their conquerors (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shame shall cover thee.</span> Shame for the destruction that hath overtaken thee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be cut off forever</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-4.htm">Malachi 1:4</a>; see Introduction, &sect; I.). Terrible retribution fell on Idumea in the time of the Maccabees (see 1 Macc. 5:3; 2 Macc. 10:15, etc.; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:08. 1), Before that time they had been dispossessed of Petra by the Nabathaeans. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry Commentary</a></div>1:1-16 This prophecy is against Edom. Its destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to the destruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction of the success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. All the enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things they stay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exalt themselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, and makes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be so safely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of our covenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we join ourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justly deny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use their understandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness, is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against any of God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem, is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good to consider what we should have done; to compare our practice with the Scripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for, who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when able to be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to make themselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceive themselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay their hands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God, it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressors know, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those of the wicked will be eternal.</body></html>
